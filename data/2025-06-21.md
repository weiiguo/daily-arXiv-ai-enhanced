### [1] [An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15045)
*Homa Nikbakht,Yonina C. Eldar,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双基地MIMO ISAC系统的URLLC方案，通过脏纸编码技术优化通信与感知性能，显著优于传统方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中，ISAC技术需同时满足超可靠低延迟通信（URLLC）和感知需求，但现有方案难以兼顾。

Method: 采用双基地MIMO ISAC系统，结合脏纸编码技术处理干扰，并评估有限块长下的速率-可靠性-检测权衡。

Result: 数值分析表明，所提方案在满足URLLC和感知约束的同时，显著提高了eMBB传输速率。

Conclusion: 基于DPC的ISAC方案为6G网络中URLLC和感知的联合优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as
a key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and
communication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs
facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving.
Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication
(URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive
targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability
constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of
URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station
(BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is
deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS
regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to
the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a
target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional
URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper
coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and
sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for
handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive
interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the
rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by
evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of
the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our
numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly
outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular,
it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and
sensing constraints.

### [2] [MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers: Capacity-Achieving Architectures with Reduced Circuit Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15052)
*Matteo Nerini,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图论的MiLAC模型，设计了复杂度更低的stem-connected MiLAC架构，显著降低了电路复杂度，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统全连接MiLAC因电路复杂度随天线数量平方增长而难以实用化的问题。

Method: 提出图论模型，设计stem-connected MiLAC架构，并优化其闭式容量解。

Result: stem-connected MiLAC在保持性能的同时，电路复杂度线性增长。

Conclusion: stem-connected MiLAC为高性能、可扩展的巨型MIMO提供了可行方案。

Abstract: To meet the demands of future wireless networks, antenna arrays must scale
from massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to gigantic MIMO, involving
even larger numbers of antennas. To address the hardware and computational cost
of gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from
the digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers
(MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming
through reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on
fully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via
tunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving,
their circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components,
scales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality.
To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of
MiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC
architectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a
family of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while
drastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize
stem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our
theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that
stem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that
scales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance,
scalable, gigantic MIMO.

### [3] [Linear and Numerical SDoF Bounds of Active RIS-Assisted MIMO Wiretap Interference Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15073)

Result: 仿真结果表明，提出的上下界在许多天线配置下重合，且下界优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 本文为RIS辅助的MIMO窃听干扰信道的SDoF分析提供了有效的理论框架和实用方法。

Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap interference channel (IC)
serves as a canonical model for information-theoretic security, where a
multiple-antenna eavesdropper attempts to intercept communications in a
two-user MIMO IC system. The secure degrees-of-freedom (SDoF) of an active
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted MIMO wiretap IC is with
practical interests but remains unexplored. In this paper, we establish both
sum-SDoF lower and upper bounds through linear beamforming conditions and
numerical methods. Specifically, our proposed lower bound is derived from
transmission scheme design and corresponding solutions to the sum-SDoF
maximization problem, formulated by linear integer programming. The solutions
to this optimization problem addresses RIS element allocation for leakage and
interference cancellation. The proposed upper bound is obtained by solving a
nuclear norm minimization problem, leveraging the fact that nuclear norm serves
as a convex relaxation of the rank function. For symmetry antenna
configurations, we derive a closed-form lower bound. Extensive numerical
simulations show that our proposed lower and upper bounds coincide across many
antenna configurations, and our proposed lower bound outperforms the existing
benchmark.

Abstract: Flag codes are a class of multishot network codes comprising sequences of
nested subspaces (flags) within the vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, where $q$ is
a prime power. In this paper, we propose a family of constructions for full
flag codes based on partial spreads. The distances of this family include
maximum distance (optimum distance flag codes), second-maximum distance
(quasi-optimum distance flag codes), as well as other feasible values. The
structure of these flag codes resembles that of a \textquotedblleft sandwich",
consisting of one layer of companion matrix and two layers of partial spreads.
Furthermore, we present an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes.

### [5] [LLM Agent for Hyper-Parameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15167)
*Wanzhe Wang,Jianqiu Peng,Menghao Hu,Weihuang Zhong,Tong Zhang,Shuai Wang,Yixin Zhang,Mingjie Shao,Wanli Ni*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进WS-PSO-CM算法在无人机通信中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前WS-PSO-CM算法的超参数调优方法依赖启发式方法，自动化程度低且性能不佳，因此需要更高效的自动调优方案。

Method: 设计了一个LLM代理，通过迭代框架和模型上下文协议（MCP）自动调优超参数。代理首先通过配置文件初始化，随后基于提示需求迭代调用WS-PSO-CM算法进行探索，最终自主终止并返回超参数。

Result: 实验表明，LLM代理生成的超参数在最小和速率上显著优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: LLM代理结合PSO知识和WS-PSO-CM算法背景，能够有效找到高性能超参数。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

### [6] [In-Context Learning for Gradient-Free Receiver Adaptation: Principles, Applications, and Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15176)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在无线接收器自适应方面存在灵活性不足或需要显式优化的问题，ICL提供了一种新的解决方案。

Method: 研究了基于Transformer和结构化状态空间模型（SSMs）的ICL架构，并应用于无蜂窝大规模MIMO网络。

Result: ICL是一种高效且理论支持的自适应方法，能够利用导频信号和上下文信息实现实时适应。

Conclusion: ICL为无线接收器的动态适应提供了一种无需在线训练的可行方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.

### [7] [New Bounds and Constructions for Variable Packet-Error Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15233)
*Xiangliang Kong,Xin Wang,Ron M. Roth,Itzhak Tamo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了可变包错误编码问题，提出了两种编码方案，分别基于高阶MDS码和重复码变体，优化了速率-失真权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多路径网络通信中动态错误纠正的需求。

Method: 提供了速率-失真权衡的理论界限，并设计了两种编码方案：基于高阶MDS码和重复码变体。

Result: 第一种方案在一般参数下优于已知结果，第二种方案在特定参数下达到最优。

Conclusion: 提出的编码方案在不同场景下优化了速率-失真性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of variable packet-error coding, which
emerges in network communication scenarios where a source transmits information
to a destination through multiple disjoint paths. The objective is to design
codes with dynamic error-correcting capabilities that adapt to varying numbers
of errors. Specifically, we first provide several bounds on the
rate--distortion trade-off for general variable packet-error coding schemes.
Then, we present two explicit constructions of variable packet-error coding
schemes. The first construction uses higher-order MDS codes and provides a
coding scheme that achieves a better rate--distortion trade-off compared to
known results for general parameter regimes. The second construction is based
on a variant of the repetition code and yields a coding scheme with an optimal
rate--distortion trade-off, with respect to our bound, for certain parameter
regimes.

### [8] [Golden Partition Zone: Rethinking Neural Network Partitioning Under Inversion Threats in Collaborative Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15412)
*Rongke Liu,Youwen Zhu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何在协作推理中通过模型分割和标签平滑增强对模型反转攻击（MIA）的抵抗力，同时最小化准确率损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法集中在浅层保护，但会导致显著的效用损失，因此需要研究如何优化模型分割以平衡安全性和性能。

Method: 通过理论分析神经网络的表示转换对条件熵的影响，并结合实验验证在表示转换层或决策层分割模型的效果。

Result: 实验表明，在表示转换层或决策层分割模型可将MIA的均方误差提高四倍以上，标签平滑进一步压缩类内方差增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 决策层特征在增强的反转模型下仍具韧性，辅助数据类型影响转换边界和重建行为。

Abstract: In collaborative inference, intermediate features transmitted from edge
devices can be exploited by adversaries to reconstruct original inputs via
model inversion attacks (MIA). While existing defenses focus on shallow-layer
protection, they often incur significant utility loss. A key open question is
how to partition the edge-cloud model to maximize resistance to MIA while
minimizing accuracy degradation. We first show that increasing model depth
alone does not guarantee resistance. Through theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that representational transitions in neural networks cause sharp
changes in conditional entropy $H(x\mid z)$, with intra-class variance (denoted
$R_c^2$) and feature dimensionality as critical factors. Experiments on three
representative deep vision models demonstrate that splitting at the
representational-transition or decision-level layers increases mean squared
error by more than four times compared to shallow splits, indicating
significantly stronger resistance to MIA. Positive label smoothing further
enhances robustness by compressing $R_c^2$ and improving generalization.
Finally, we validate the resilience of decision-level features under enhanced
inversion models and observe that the type of auxiliary data influences both
transition boundaries and reconstruction behavior.

### [9] [Towards Weight Distribution-Aware Polar Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15467)
*Mohammad Rowshan,Vlad-Florin Dragoi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文探讨了无需预变换的极化码结构，通过权重贡献偏序设计极化类码以改善权重分布，实验结果显示其优于多种预变换和非预变换码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极化码基于子信道可靠性构建，但信息论方法导致权重分布较差。本文旨在通过权重贡献偏序设计极化类码，改善权重分布，无需预变换或优化算法。

Method: 利用权重贡献偏序指导设计极化类码，避免使用搜索或优化算法。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法在权重分布上优于多种预变换和非预变换码。

Conclusion: 通过权重贡献偏序设计的极化类码能有效改善权重分布，无需预变换或复杂算法。

Abstract: Polar codes are constructed based on the reliability of sub-channels
resulting from the polarization effect. However, this information-theoretic
construction approach leads to a poor weight distribution. To address this
issue, pre-transformed polar codes, such as CRC-polar codes and PAC codes, have
been employed. In this paper, we focus on the structure of polar codes without
applying any pre-transformations and explore methods, guided by the
weight-contribution partial order, to design polar-like codes with enhanced
weight distribution, notably without employing any search or optimization
algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate improvement over a range of codes
both with and without pre-transformation.

Result: 自编码器实现了有效的降维，瓶颈层与真实间距有强相关性。球形贝塞尔函数信号表现最佳，三角波次之，sinc信号最差。

Conclusion: 信号设计对基于机器学习的测距分辨率至关重要，贝塞尔信号表现最优。

Abstract: We apply machine learning methods to demonstrate range superresolution in
remote sensing radar detection. Specifically, we implement a denoising
autoencoder to estimate the distance between two equal intensity scatterers in
the subwavelength regime. The machine learning models are trained on waveforms
subject to a bandlimit constraint such that ranges much smaller than the
inverse bandlimit are optimized in their precision. The autoencoder achieves
effective dimensionality reduction, with the bottleneck layer exhibiting a
strong and consistent correlation with the true scatterer separation. We
confirm reproducibility across different training sessions and network
initializations by analyzing the scaled encoder outputs and their robustness to
noise. We investigate the behavior of the bottleneck layer for the following
types of pulses: a traditional sinc pulse, a bandlimited triangle-type pulse,
and a theoretically near-optimal pulse created from a spherical Bessel function
basis. The Bessel signal performs best, followed by the triangle wave, with the
sinc signal performing worst, highlighting the crucial role of signal design in
the success of machine-learning-based range resolution.

Result: 模型展示了在SIM辅助的无线系统中增强波形性能的潜力。

Conclusion: MPDD模型为RIS和SIM集成的MIMO系统提供了新的解决方案，并展示了其可编程性和应用潜力。

Abstract: The doubly-dispersive (DD) channel structure has played a pivotal role in
wireless communications, particularly in high-mobility scenarios and integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC), due to its ability to capture the key fading
effects experienced by a transmitted signal as it propagates through a dynamic
medium. However, extending the DD framework to multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems, especially in environments artificially enhanced by
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and stacked intelligent metasurfaces
(SIM), remains a challenging open problem. In this chapter, a novel
metasurfaces-parametrized DD (MPDD) channel model that integrates an arbitrary
number of RISs, while also incorporating SIM at both the transmitter and
receiver is introduced. Next, the application of this model to some key
waveforms optimized for DD environments -- namely orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine
frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) -- is discussed. Finally, the
programmability of the proposed model is highlighted through an illustrative
application, demonstrating its potential for enhancing waveform performance in
SIM-assisted wireless systems.

### [12] [Secure Time-Modulated Intelligent Reflecting Surface via Generative Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14992)
*Zhihao Tao,Athina P. Petropulu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成式AI的时间调制智能反射面（TM-IRS）设计方法，用于多用户OFDM系统的定向调制，以提升安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TM-IRS设计方法仅适用于单用户场景，无法满足多用户需求，因此需要一种更灵活高效的设计方法。

Method: 采用生成式AI（GFlowNets）建模TM-IRS参数选择为确定性MDP，通过训练学习参数配置的随机策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了多用户OFDM系统的安全性，且训练效率极高，仅需极少量配置即可收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法为多用户TM-IRS设计提供了高效解决方案，并展示了生成式AI在通信系统中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel directional modulation (DM) design for OFDM transmitters
aided by a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS). The TM-IRS
is configured to preserve the integrity of transmitted signals toward multiple
legitimate users while scrambling the signal in all other directions. Existing
TM-IRS design methods typically target a single user direction and follow
predefined rule-based procedures, making them unsuitable for multi-user
scenarios. Here, we propose a generative AI-based approach to design good sets
of TM-IRS parameters out of a set of all possible quantized ranges of
parameters. The design objective is to maximize the sum rate across the
authorized directions. We model the TM-IRS parameter selection as a
deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state
corresponds to a specific configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets are
employed to learn a stochastic policy that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with
probability proportional to their associated sum rate reward. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the security
of the TM-IRS-aided OFDM systems with multi-users. Also, despite the vast size
of the TM-IRS configuration space, the GFlowNet is able to converge after
training on fewer than 0.000001% of all possible configurations, demonstrating
remarkable efficiency compared to exhaustive combinatorial search.
Implementation code is available at https://github.com/ZhihaoTao/GFN4TM-RIS to

Abstract: With the applicability of optical fiber-based distributed acoustic sensing
(DAS) systems, effective signal processing and analysis approaches are needed
to promote its popularization in the field of intelligent transportation
systems (ITS). This paper presents a signal denoising algorithm using a hybrid
deep-learning network (HDLNet). Without annotated data and time-consuming
labeling, this self-supervised network runs in parallel, combining an
autoencoder for denoising (DAE) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for
sequential processing. Additionally, a line-by-line matching algorithm for
vehicle detection and tracking is introduced, thus realizing the complete
processing of fiber signal denoising and feature extraction. Experiments were
carried out on a self-established real highway tunnel dataset, showing that our
proposed hybrid network yields more satisfactory denoising performance than
Spatial-domain DAE.

Conclusion: OMS方案为多基站多用户系统提供了一种高效的波束预测和基站选择方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-user millimeter-wave communication relies on narrow beams and dense
cell deployments to ensure reliable connectivity. However, tracking optimal
beams for multiple mobile users across multiple base stations (BSs) results in
significant signaling overhead. Recent works have explored the capability of
out-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless
channels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user
systems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense
cell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing
overhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to
eliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in
multi-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
OOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize
multi-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB
modalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially
identified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and
then tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence.
Subsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network
(BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for
mobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to
perform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the
proposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS
selection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the
optimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS
coordination efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Yuxuan Xia,Ángel F. García-Fernández,Johan Karlsson,Yu Ge,Lennart Svensson,Ting Yuan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种广义的轨迹最优子模式分配（GOSPA）度量方法，用于评估提供轨迹估计的多目标跟踪算法，并考虑了轨迹级不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多目标跟踪算法需要一种能够同时考虑存在性和状态估计不确定性的评估指标，以更全面地衡量其性能。

Method: 基于概率GOSPA度量，将其扩展为多维分配问题，并通过线性规划松弛实现多项式时间计算。

Result: 该度量保留了TGOSPA的可解释性，并能分解为直观的成本项，如定位误差、存在概率不匹配误差等。仿真研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的度量方法在多目标跟踪评估中具有实用性和可解释性，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal
sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking
algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties.
This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to
account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual
object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a
multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming
relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time.
Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show
that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected
localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly
detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch
error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a
simulation study.

Abstract: The vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to signal
interference have increased the demand for complementary positioning,
navigation, and timing (PNT) systems. To address this, South Korea has decided
to deploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system as a complementary
PNT solution. Similar to GNSS, eLoran provides highly accurate timing
information, which is essential for applications such as telecommunications,
financial systems, and power distribution. However, the primary sources of
error for GNSS and eLoran differ. For eLoran, the main source of error is
signal propagation delay over land, known as the additional secondary factor
(ASF). This delay, influenced by ground conductivity and weather conditions
along the signal path, is challenging to predict and mitigate. In this paper,
we measure the time difference (TD) between GPS and eLoran using a time
interval counter and analyze the correlations between eLoran/GPS TD and eleven
meteorological factors. Accurate estimation of eLoran/GPS TD could enable
eLoran to achieve timing accuracy comparable to that of GPS. We propose two
estimation models for eLoran/GPS TD and compare their performance with existing
TD estimation methods. The proposed WLR-AGRNN model captures the linear
relationships between meteorological factors and eLoran/GPS TD using weighted
linear regression (WLR) and models nonlinear relationships between outputs from
expert networks through an anisotropic general regression neural network
(AGRNN). The model incorporates terrain elevation to appropriately weight
meteorological data, as elevation influences signal propagation delay.
Experimental results based on four months of data demonstrate that the
WLR-AGRNN model outperforms other models, highlighting its effectiveness in
improving eLoran/GPS TD estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Flexible and efficient wireless resource sharing across heterogeneous
services is a key objective for future wireless networks. In this context, we
investigate the performance of a system where latency-constrained
internet-of-things (IoT) devices coexist with a broadband user. The base
station adopts a grant-free access framework to manage resource allocation,
either through orthogonal radio access network (RAN) slicing or by allowing
shared access between services. For the IoT users, we propose a reinforcement
learning (RL) approach based on double Q-Learning (QL) to optimise their
repetition-based transmission strategy, allowing them to adapt to varying
levels of interference and meet a predefined latency target. We evaluate the
system's performance in terms of the cumulative distribution function of IoT
users' latency, as well as the broadband user's throughput and energy
efficiency (EE). Our results show that the proposed RL-based access policies
significantly enhance the latency performance of IoT users in both RAN Slicing
and RAN Sharing scenarios, while preserving desirable broadband throughput and
EE. Furthermore, the proposed policies enable RAN Sharing to be
energy-efficient at low IoT traffic levels, and RAN Slicing to be favourable
under high IoT traffic.

Abstract: This paper studies a high-altitude platform (HAP) network supported by
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The practical irregular placement
of HAPs and RISs is modeled using homogeneous Poisson point processes, while
buildings that cause blockages in urban areas are modeled as a Boolean scheme
of rectangles. We introduce a novel approach to characterize the statistical
channel based on generalized Beta prime distribution. Analytical expressions
for coverage probability and ergodic capacity in an interference-limited system
are derived and validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings show
notable performance improvements and reveal the impact of various system
parameters, including blockages effect which contribute in mitigating
interference from the other visible HAPs. This proposed system could enhance
connectivity and enable effective data offloading in urban environments.

Motivation: 量化是数据采集中的关键环节，但其对一维一阶差分麦克风阵列性能的影响尚未被研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析一维一阶DMA的量化波束形成输出表达式，研究了量化对波束图、DF、FBR和ND的影响。

Result: 量化对波束图结构无影响，主要影响ND。DF和FBR不受量化位数变化影响，而ND随量化位数增加而改善。

Conclusion: 量化对DMA性能的影响集中在ND上，且ND随量化位数增加而提高，但靠近声源方向的零深性能会下降。

Abstract: In practical systems, recorded analog signals must be digitized for
processing, introducing quantization as a critical aspect of data acquisition.
While prior studies have examined quantization effects in various signal
processing contexts, its impact on differential microphone arrays (DMAs),
particularly in one-dimensional (1D) first-order configurations, remains
unexplored. This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on
performance of first-order 1D DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical
expression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D DMA has been
formulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array
performance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF),
Front-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and null depth (ND). Simulation results reveal that
beampattern shape remains structurally invariant across quantization bit
depths, with quantization primarily affecting ND. DF and FBR remain constant
with the varying number of quantization bits. Additionally, ND is shown to be
frequency-independent; however, it increases with increasing quantization bit
depths, enhancing interference suppression. The study also examines the effect
of steering nulls across the azimuthal range, showing that ND degrades as the
null moves closer to the source look direction, indicating reduced interference
suppression.

Motivation: 未来无线通信系统可能在高频段大规模天线阵列的近场区域运行，近场波束聚焦可实现空间多路复用，但阵列几何形状对性能的影响尚不明确。

Method: 论文推导了广义URA的波束深度，定义了有效波束聚焦瑞利距离（EBRD），并通过仿真验证了不同几何形状URA的性能。

Result: 方形URA的波束深度最窄，但EBRD受限；宽或高URA的EBRD更大，多用户总速率比方形URA高3.5倍。

Conclusion: 宽或高URA在近场波束聚焦和多路复用性能上优于方形URA，更适合未来无线通信系统。

Abstract: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequency bands, future
wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative
near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused
within a spatial region of finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in both
the angular and range dimensions. This paper derives the beamdepth for a
generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry
influences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field
beamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of
beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective
beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis
reveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is
maximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a
square URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely
constrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a
sum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended
EBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities.
