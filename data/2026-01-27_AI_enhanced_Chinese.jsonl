This shortcoming has recently been addressed with the advent of waveform measurement units (WMUs), which provide high-resolution, time-synchronized raw voltage and current waveform samples from multiple locations in the power system. However, transient model learning based on synchro-waveform measurements remains constrained by the scarcity of network disturbances and the complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of IBRs. We propose to address these problems by developing a data-efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework for synchro-waveform analytics that estimates the IBR terminal current response from only a few network disturbance signatures. Here, the physics of the electrical circuits are used to compensate for limited data availability by constraining the learning process through known circuit relationships. Two cases are considered, with known and unknown circuit parameters. In the latter case, the framework jointly learns the transient dynamics of the IBRs and the parameters of the electrical circuit. Case studies using WMU disturbance data across multiple sampling rates shows consistently lower current estimation error with substantially fewer training events than a purely data-driven baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u6ce2\u5f62\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u6270\u52a8\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u57fa\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6682\u6001\u7535\u6d41\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u91cf\u548cSCADA\u6d4b\u91cf\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u57fa\u8d44\u6e90\uff08IBRs\uff09\u5728\u7535\u7f51\u6270\u52a8\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6682\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ce2\u5f62\u6d4b\u91cf\u5355\u5143\uff08WMUs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u540c\u6b65\u6ce2\u5f62\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u6b65\u6ce2\u5f62\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6682\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u6270\u52a8\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u548cIBRs\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u7535\u8def\u7269\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u8865\u507f\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a\u5df2\u77e5\u7535\u8def\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7535\u8def\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u53c2\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60IBRs\u6682\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7535\u8def\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u7684WMU\u6270\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7535\u8def\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684IBRs\u6682\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u540c\u6b65\u6ce2\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A compact RIS kernel model that explicitly links the radar's angular response to the RIS phase profile is introduced, enabling an analytical investigation of the Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation accuracy with respect to the kernel's power. This model is also leveraged to formulate an RIS-based spoofing design with the dual objective to enforce strict nulls around the UE's true reflection AoA and maximize the channel gain towards a decoy direction. The RIS's deception capability is quantified using point-wise and angle-range robust criteria, and a configuration-independent placement score guiding decoy selection is proposed.

Cooperative multi-task SemCom (CMT-SemCom) further improves task execution performance. However, [1] demonstrates that cooperative multi-tasking can be either constructive or destructive. Moreover, the existing CMT-SemCom framework is not directly applicable to distributed multi-user scenarios, such as non-terrestrial satellite networks, where each satellite employs an individual semantic encoder. In this paper, we extend our earlier CMT-SemCom framework to distributed settings by proposing a federated learning (FL) based CMT-SemCom that enables cooperative multi-tasking across distributed users. Moreover, to address performance degradation caused by negative information transfer among heterogeneous tasks, we propose a semantic-aware task clustering method integrated in the FL process to ensure constructive cooperation based on an information-theoretic approach. Unlike common clustering methods that rely on high-dimensional data or feature space similarity, our proposed approach operates in the low-dimensional semantic domain to identify meaningful task relationships. Simulation results based on a LEO satellite network setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and performance gain over unclustered FL and individual single-task SemCom.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u540c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u7c7b\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u8d1f\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8f68\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u540c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u534f\u540c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8d1f\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u540c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2. \u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u8f68\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u540c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\u03a3_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. We show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical LLM quantization algorithms (GPTQ), which at present allocate rate equally. This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\u03a3_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\\frac{2\u03c0e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). GPTQ's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $\u03a3_X$ from Llama-3-8B we find GPTQ to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of WaterSIC, suggesting that GPTQ with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u548c\u4ec5\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c34\u586b\u5145\u7684WaterSIC\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u5185\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1a\u901a\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08\u6743\u91cd+\u6fc0\u6d3b\u91cf\u5316\uff09\u548c\u4ec5\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9ad8\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u7387\u4e0e\u5931\u771f\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51faWaterSIC\u65b9\u6848\u5e94\u7528\u6c34\u586b\u5145\u539f\u7406\u4f18\u5316GPTQ\u7684\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "WaterSIC\u65b9\u6848\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u91cfINT\u91cf\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u03a3_X\u7684\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7387\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5931\u771f\u6781\u9650\u4ec5\u5dee\u4e58\u6027\u56e0\u5b502\u03c0e/12\uff08\u7ea60.25\u6bd4\u7279/\u6761\u76ee\uff09\u3002GPTQ\u5728\u968f\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1WaterSIC\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c34\u586b\u5145\u7684WaterSIC\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff0cGPTQ\u5728\u968f\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u4e5f\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

ME-WARD is designed to process joint angle data from motion capture systems, including inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based setups, and deep learning human body pose tracking models. The tool's flexibility enables ergonomic risk assessment using any system capable of reliably measuring joint angles, extending the applicability of RULA beyond proprietary setups. To validate its performance, the tool was tested in an industrial setting during the assembly of conveyor belts, which involved high-risk tasks such as inserting rods and pushing conveyor belt components. The experiments leveraged gold standard IMU systems alongside a state-of-the-art monocular 3D pose estimation system. The results confirmed that ME-WARD produces reliable RULA scores that closely align with IMU-derived metrics for flexion-dominated movements and comparable performance with the monocular system, despite limitations in tracking lateral and rotational motions. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiple motion capture technologies into a unified and accessible ergonomic assessment pipeline.

We consider an advanced antenna system (AAS) controlled by a centralized baseband unit (BBU). In the AAS, multiple antenna elements together with their radio units are integrated into a single unit. In this setup, a key challenge is allocating fronthaul bits between uplink channel state information (CSI) quantization and downlink precoding matrix quantization. We formulate the problem of maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE) for a given fronthaul capacity. We develop an SE expression for this scenario based on the hardening bound. We compute the expression in closed form for maximum ratio transmission, which reveals the relative impact of the two types of quantization distortion. We then formulate a bit split optimization problem and propose an algorithm that exactly solves it.\n  Numerical results demonstrate how the relative importance of assigning bits to CSI and precoding varies depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u7528\u6237MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u5bb9\u91cf\u524d\u4f20\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u4e0a\u884cCSI\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u4e0b\u884c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u77e9\u9635\u91cf\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728AAS\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0cBBU\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u4f20\u94fe\u8def\u63a7\u5236\u5929\u7ebf\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u524d\u4f20\u94fe\u8def\u4e0a\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0a\u884cCSI\u548c\u4e0b\u884c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u524d\u4f20\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u7279\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u786c\u5316\u754c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u901f\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u6bd4\u4f20\u8f93\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u5931\u771f\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7136\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u7ed9CSI\u548c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u968f\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u524d\u4f20\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MU-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574CSI\u548c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The proposed modular solution can interoperate with commercial systems throughout the ergonomics assessment phases involved in the process. The pipeline includes custom-designed Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, two real-time worker movement acquisition tools, inverse kinematics processing and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) report generation. It is based on free tools such as Unity3D and OpenSim to avoid the problems derived from using proprietary technologies, such as security decisions being made under \"black box\" conditions. Experiments were conducted in an automotive factory in a workplace with WMSDs risk among workers. The proposed solution obtained comparable results to a gold standard solution, reaching measured joint angles a 0.95 cross-correlation and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 10 for elbows and 12 for shoulders between both systems. In addition, the global RULA score difference is lower than 5% between both systems. This work provides a low-cost solution for WMSDs risk assessment in the workplace to reduce musculoskeletal disorders and associated sick leave in industry, impacting the health of workers in the long term.

A tractable approximation is given by the so-called Bethe permanent that can be efficiently computed by running the sum-product algorithm on a suitable factor graph. While the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent is, in the worst case, upper and lower bounded by expressions that are exponentially far apart in the matrix size, in practice it is observed for many ensembles of matrices of interest that this ratio is strongly concentrated around some value that depends only on the matrix size. In this paper, for an ensemble of block-structured matrices where entries in a block take the same value, we numerically study the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent. It is observed that also for this ensemble the ratio is strongly concentrated around some value depending only on a few key parameters of the ensemble.

Falls are among the most critical events to monitor due to their timely response requirement, yet frequent false alarms or uncertain detections can overwhelm caregivers and contribute to alarm fatigue. This motivates the design of reliable, whole end-to-end ambient monitoring systems from occupancy and activity awareness to fall and post-fall detection. In this paper, we focus on robust post-fall floor-occupancy detection using an off-the-shelf 60 GHz FMCW radar and evaluate its deployment in a realistic, furnished indoor environment representative of LTC facilities. Post-fall detection is challenging since motion is minimal, and reflections from the floor and surrounding objects can dominate the radar signal return. We compare a vendor-provided digital beamforming (DBF) pipeline against a proposed preprocessing approach based on Capon or minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming. A cell-averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector is applied and evaluated on the resulting range-azimuth maps across 7 participants.

Yet detecting quasi-static presence (lying, sitting, or standing with only subtle micro-motions) is difficult for low-resolution SIMO FMCW radar because near-zero Doppler energy is often buried under static clutter. We present Respiratory-Amplification Semi-Static Occupancy (RASSO), an invertible Doppler-domain non-linear remapping that densifies the slow-time FFT (Doppler) grid around 0 m/s before adaptive Capon beamforming. The resulting range-azimuth (RA) maps exhibit higher effective SNR, sharper target peaks, and lower background variance, making thresholding and learning more reliable. On a real nursing-home dataset collected with a short-range 1Tx-3Rx radar, RASSO-RA improves classical detection performance, achieving AUC = 0.981 and recall = 0.920/0.947 at FAR = 1%/5%, outperforming conventional Capon processing and a recent baseline. RASSO-RA also benefits data-driven models: a frame-based CNN reaches 95-99% accuracy and a sequence-based CNN-LSTM reaches 99.4-99.6% accuracy across subjects. A paired session-level bootstrap test confirms statistically significant macro-F1 gains of 2.6-3.6 points (95% confidence intervals above zero) over the non-warped pipeline.

Submitted to ISIT 2026. This is a follow-up to the following paper: arXiv:2601.10678", "summary": "Due to the fundamental connection between next-symbol prediction and compression, modern predictive models, such as large language models (LLMs), can be combined with entropy coding to achieve compression rates that surpass those of standard compression algorithms. However, this approach relies on the assumption that the predictive model produces identical output distributions at both the encoder and decoder, since even small mismatches can cause the decoding to fail. This assumption often fails with complex predictive models, particularly those based on neural networks, a phenomenon referred to as non-determinism.\n  In this work, we propose a new compression algorithm based on next-token prediction that is robust to arbitrarily large, but structured, prediction mismatches. We prove the correctness of the proposed scheme under a formal mismatch certification, characterize its theoretical performance, and validate it experimentally on real datasets. Our results demonstrate reliable operation within the certified mismatch regime while achieving compression ratios that exceed those of commonly used compression methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u71b5\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u89e3\u7801\u5931\u8d25", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u5927\u4f46\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd"}}

To address these issues, we propose a sensitivity-aware model division multiple access (S-MDMA) framework tailored for bandwidth-limited multi-user scenarios. The proposed framework first performs semantic extraction and merging based on the MDMA architecture to consolidate redundant information. To further improve transmission efficiency, a semantic sensitivity sorting algorithm is presented, which can selectively retain key semantic features. In addition, to mitigate inter-user interference, the framework incorporates orthogonal embedding of semantic features and introduces a multi-user reconstruction loss function to guide joint optimization.

The deep integration of communication and sensing is widely recognized as a core 6G vision, underscoring the importance of comprehensive environment awareness. Accurate channel modeling forms the foundation of 6G system design and optimization, and channel sounders provide the essential empirical basis. However, existing channel sounders, although supporting wide bandwidth and large antenna arrays in selected bands, generally lack cross-band capability, struggle in dynamic scenarios, and provide limited environmental awareness. The absence of detailed environmental information restricts the development of environment-aware channel models. To address this gap, we propose a multi-modal sensing and channel sounding fusion platform that enables temporally and spatially synchronized acquisition of images, point clouds, geolocation information, and multi-band multi-antenna channel data. The modular architecture facilitates rapid deployment in diverse dynamic environments. The platform supports Sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands with up to 1 GHz bandwidth and 1 ns delay resolution, enabling multi-antenna measurements with a channel switching rate of 8 ms. Moreover, it achieves centimeter-level and 360\u00b0 environmental sensing accuracy and meter-level positioning accuracy. Key performance metrics of the platform, including dynamic range, phase stability, delay resolution, and multimodal data synchronization, are validated through vehicle-to-infrastructure measurement campaign.

An emerging research direction deals with the realization of inference ML models directly in the physical layer of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, which, however, entails certain significant challenges. In this paper, leveraging the technology of programmable MetaSurfaces (MSs), we present an eXtremely Large (XL) MIMO system that acts as an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) performing binary classification tasks completely Over-The-Air (OTA), which can be trained in closed form. The proposed system comprises a receiver architecture consisting of densely parallel placed diffractive layers of XL MSs followed by a single reception radio-frequency chain. The front layer facing the MIMO channel consists of identical unit cells of a fixed NonLinear (NL) response, while the remaining layers of elements of tunable linear responses are utilized to approximate OTA the trained ELM weights. Our numerical investigations showcase that, in the XL regime of MS elements, the proposed XL-MIMO-ELM system achieves performance comparable to that of digital and idealized ML models across diverse datasets and wireless scenarios, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of embedding OTA learning capabilities into future communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u7684XL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6781\u9650\u5b66\u4e60\u673a(ELM)\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u6267\u884cOTA\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u901a\u4fe1\u8303\u5f0f\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u8f93\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406ML\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728XL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165OTA\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7531\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e76\u884c\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u884d\u5c04\u5c42XL\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u524d\u5c42\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u5c42\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u8c03\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u5143\u4ef6\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3cOTA\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ELM\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ed\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728XL\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u5143\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684XL-MIMO-ELM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684ML\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c06OTA\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u5d4c\u5165\u672a\u6765\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing codes for PDMM are either specialized for the outer product partitioning (OPP), or inner product partitioning (IPP), or are valid for the more general grid partitioning (GP). We design extension operations that can be applied to a large class of OPP code designs to extend them to the GP case. Applying them to existing codes improves upon the state-of-the-art for certain parameters. Additionally, we show that the GP schemes resulting from extension fulfill additional combinatorial constraints, potentially limiting their performance.

In a scenario with UAV-BSs deployed to handle sudden traffic surges in urban areas, the aerial-active-RIS both reflects and amplifies backhaul signals to overcome blockage.

Simulation results demonstrate that PRSS achieves greater than 2.5 dB and 10 dB bit error rate improvements compared to current single-transmission methods when employing optimal exhaustive search and low-complexity sub-optimal detection methods, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76f8\u4f4d\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b26\u53f7\u6269\u5c55(PRSS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3Rydberg\u539f\u5b50\u63a5\u6536\u673aMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e24\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u9699\u4f20\u8f93\u5e26\u6709\u03c0/2\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u7ebf\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "Rydberg\u539f\u5b50\u63a5\u6536\u673aMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfRF-MIMO\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u4f4d\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b26\u53f7\u6269\u5c55(PRSS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u9699\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u4f18\u03c0/2\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u5355\u6b21\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cPRSS\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u8d85\u8fc72.5 dB\u7684\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6b21\u4f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u8d85\u8fc710 dB\u7684\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "PRSS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Rydberg\u539f\u5b50\u63a5\u6536\u673aMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edfRF-MIMO\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f97\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose a context-aware token communication framework that uses a pretrained masked language model (MLM) as a shared contextual probability model between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). At Rx, we develop an iterative token detection method that jointly exploits MLM-guided contextual priors and channel observations based on a Bayesian perspective. At Tx, we additionally introduce a context-aware masking strategy which skips highly predictable token transmission to reduce transmission rate.

Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ interconnected users, each holding a private input, representing, for example, local model updates in FL, who aim to simultaneously compute the sum of all inputs while satisfying the security requirement that no user, even when colluding with up to $T$ others, learns anything beyond the intended sum. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one bit of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one bit to all other users, (ii) hold at least one bit of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key bits.

In this paper, we investigate the use of MAs for two typical near-field beamforming scenarios: beam nulling and multi-beam forming. In the first scenario, we aim to jointly optimize the positions of multiple MAs and the beamforming vector to maximize the beam gain toward a desired direction while nulling interference toward multiple undesired directions. In the second scenario, the objective is to maximize the minimum beam gain among all the above directions. However, both problems are non-convex and challenging to solve optimally. To gain insights, we first analyze several special cases and show that, with proper positioning of the MAs, directing the beam toward a specific direction can lead to nulls or full gains in other directions in the two scenarios, respectively. For the general cases, we propose a discrete sampling method and an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions to the two formulated problems. Furthermore, considering the practical limitations in antenna positioning accuracy, we analyze the impact of position errors on the performance of the optimized beamforming and MA positions, by introducing a Taylor series approximation for the near-field beam gain at each target. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6ce2\u675f\u7f6e\u96f6\u548c\u591a\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5929\u7ebf\u80fd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6ce2\u675f\u7f6e\u96f6\u548c\u591a\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6ce2\u675f\u7f6e\u96f6\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2aMA\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5411\u91cf\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u671f\u671b\u65b9\u5411\u589e\u76ca\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6ce2\u675f\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6cf0\u52d2\u7ea7\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5206\u6790\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u914d\u7f6eMA\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c04\u6ce2\u675f\u53ef\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u5411\u4ea7\u751f\u96f6\u70b9\u6216\u5168\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6ce2\u675f\u7f6e\u96f6\u548c\u591a\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86MA\u6280\u672f\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Under non-IID data, however, aggressively sampling only fast clients may significantly slow convergence due to statistical heterogeneity. This paper studies PASS-enabled FL, where a radiating pinching antenna (PA) can be activated at an arbitrary position along a dielectric waveguide to reshape uplink latencies. We consider a joint optimization of PA placement and client participation to minimize the expected time-to-accuracy, coupling the exact expected maximum round latency via order statistics with a heterogeneity-aware convergence factor. We derive first-order optimality conditions that reveal an explicit tail-latency premium in the KKT recursion, quantifying how latency gaps are amplified by maximum-order-statistic synchronization. Under a latency-class structure, we obtain a within-class square-root sampling law and establish a two-class phase transition where slow-class participation collapses under an explicit heterogeneity-threshold condition as the per-round sample size grows. For PA placement, we prove a piecewise envelope-derivative characterization and provide an exact breakpoint-and-root candidate-enumeration procedure.

Submitted for publication", "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are eminently suitable for wireless resource management, thanks to their scalability, but they still face computational challenges in large-scale, dense networks in classical computers. The integration of quantum computing with GNNs offers a promising pathway for enhancing computational efficiency because they reduce the model complexity. This is achieved by leveraging the quantum advantages of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), while retaining the expressive power of GNNs. However, existing pure quantum message passing models remain constrained by the limited number of qubits, hence limiting the scalability of their application to the wireless systems. As a remedy, we conceive a Scalable Quantum Message Passing Graph Neural Network (SQM-GNN) relying on a quantum message passing architecture. To address the aforementioned scalability issue, we decompose the graph into subgraphs and apply a shared PQC to each local subgraph.

A non-orthogonal pilot transmission scheme is considered to accommodate a larger number of users that can be supported by ELAA systems without incurring an excessive amount of training overhead. To facilitate efficient multi-user channel estimation, we express the received signal as a third-order low-rank tensor, which admits a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) model for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios and a block term decomposition (BTD) model for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. An alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm and a non-linear least squares (NLS) algorithm are employed to perform CPD and BTD, respectively. Channel parameters are then efficiently extracted from the recovered factor matrices. By exploiting the geometry of the propagation paths in the estimated channel, users' positions can be precisely determined in LoS scenarios. Moreover, our uniqueness analysis shows that the proposed tensor-based joint multi-user channel estimation framework is effective even when the number of pilot symbols is much smaller than the number of users, revealing its potential in training overhead reduction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves markedly higher channel estimation accuracy than compressed sensing (CS)-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u8fd1\u573aOFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u5bfc\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CPD/BTD\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728ELAA\u8fd1\u573aOFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6b63\u4ea4\u5bfc\u9891\u65b9\u6848\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e09\u9636\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\uff1a\u5728LoS\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528CPD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728NLoS\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528BTD\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u91c7\u7528ALS\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884cCPD\u5206\u89e3\uff0cNLS\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884cBTD\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u6062\u590d\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bfc\u9891\u7b26\u53f7\u6570\u91cf\u8fdc\u5c11\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u6570\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728LoS\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fd8\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aELAA\u8fd1\u573aOFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional Channel Charting (CC) methods map high-dimensional CSI data to low-dimensional spaces to help reveal the geometric structure of wireless channels. However, most existing CC methods focus on learning static geometric structures and ignore the dynamic nature of the channel over time, leading to instability and poor topological consistency of the channel charting in complex environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel time-series channel charting approach based on the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Auto encoders (AE) (LSTM-AE-CC). This method incorporates a temporal modeling mechanism into the traditional CC framework, capturing temporal dependencies in CSI using LSTM and learning continuous latent representations with AE. The proposed method ensures both geometric consistency of the channel and explicit modeling of the time-varying properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional CC methods in various real-world communication scenarios, particularly in terms of channel charting stability, trajectory continuity, and long-term predictability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLSTM-AE\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u9053\u5236\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4fe1\u9053\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57286G\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u9053\u5236\u56fe\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u5236\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u9759\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fe1\u9053\u5236\u56fe\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u3002\u968f\u77406G\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLSTM-AE-CC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u3002LSTM\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u6349CSI\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0cAE\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5165\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u5236\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u5236\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u5236\u56fe\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "LSTM-AE-CC\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u65f6\u53d8\u7279\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5236\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To tackle spectrum scarcity, spectrum sharing is studied for a hybrid satellite-terrestrial network where satellite links share the same group of time-slotted sub-carriers with terrestrial links opportunistically. In particular, with coarse network-wide time synchronization, a time-scale-adaptable spectrum sharing framework is proposed based on a satellite-terrestrial cooperation time scale that can be flexibly adjusted according to practical requirements. For generality, it is assumed that both full and partial frequency reuse could be adopted among the base stations (BSs) and satellite selection is supported when multiple satellites are available. Relying on only statistical channel state information (CSI), joint link scheduling and power control are explored to maximize the average sum rate of the network while ensuring quality of service (QoS) for users. To solve the complicated mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, a low-complexity spectrum sharing scheme is presented based on link-feature-sketching-aided hierarchical link clustering and Monte-Carlo-and-successive-approximation-aided transmit power optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that by link feature sketching, diversity of the links brought by the spatial distribution of the users could be well utilized.

Although achieving high rates typically requires sufficiently large message sizes, smaller message sizes also desirable due to reduced implementation complexity and fewer constraints. By characterizing the capacity-achieving schemes, Tian, Sun, and Chen (2019) showed that the optimal message size for uniformly decomposable PIR schemes under no-collusion setting is $N-1$. However, comparable results are not yet available for more general collusion settings.\n  In this work, we present a complete characterization of the properties of capacity-achieving decomposable PIR schemes under arbitrary collusion patterns. Building on this characterization, we derive a general lower bound on the optimal message size for capacity-achieving uniformly decomposable PIR schemes under an arbitrary collusion pattern $\\mathcal{P}$, expressed in terms of the hitting number of a newly defined family of subsets of servers determined by the collusion pattern $\\mathcal{P}$. Finally, we specialize the lower bound to several important classes of collusion patterns, including $T$-collusion, disjoint collections of colluding sets, cyclically $T$-contiguous collusion, and disjoint collections of cyclically contiguous colluding sets.

Nevertheless, their specific impact on hybrid radar fusion (HRF) remains largely unexplored. In HRF systems, where uplink (UL) paths carry direct and reflected signals in the same frequency band, the reflected signal is often significantly weaker, making HRF performance particularly sensitive to ADC resolution. To study this effect, we use the quantized Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) to measure sensing accuracy. This work derives an upper bound on the quantized CRB for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation and explores CRB-rate trade-offs through two formulated optimization problems. Simulation results indicate that HRF becomes infeasible when the dynamic range of the received signal exceeds the dynamic range supported by the ADC, which is inherently limited by its resolution. Furthermore, the UL communication rate does not increase significantly when the ADC resolution is raised beyond a certain threshold. These observations highlight a fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication performance: while HRF performance benefits from higher ADC resolutions, the corresponding gains in communication rate plateau.

A substring edit in a string $\\mathbf{x}$ occurs when a substring $\\mathbf{u}$ of $\\mathbf{x}$ is replaced by an arbitrary string $\\mathbf{v}$. The lengths of $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are bounded from above by a fixed constant. Let $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ be two binary strings that differ by multiple substring edits. The aim of document exchange schemes is to construct an encoding of $\\mathbf{x}$ with small length such that $\\mathbf{x}$ can be recovered using $\\mathbf{y}$ and the encoding. We construct a low-complexity document exchange scheme with encoding length of $4t\\log n+o(\\log n)$ bits, where $n$ is the length of the string $\\mathbf{x}$. The best known scheme achieves an encoding length of $4t \\log n+O(\\log\\log n)$ bits, but at a much higher computational complexity. Then, we investigate the average length of valid encodings for document exchange schemes with uniform strings $\\mathbf{x}$ and develop a scheme with an expected encoding length of $(4t-1) \\log n+o(\\log n)$ bits.

Despite decades of effort, improving the GV bound is notoriously difficult, and known improvements often rely on technically heavy arguments and do not extend naturally to the quantum setting due to additional self-orthogonality constraints.\n  In this work we develop a concise probabilistic method that yields an improvement over the classical GV bound for $q$-ary linear codes. For relative distance $\u03b4=d/n<1-1/q$, we show that an $[n,k,d]_q$ linear code exists whenever $\\frac{q^{k}-1}{q-1}\\;<\\;\\frac{c_\u03b4\\sqrt{n}\\, q^{n}}{\\mathrm{Vol}_q(n,d-1)}$, for positive constant $c_\u03b4$ depending only on $\u03b4$, where $\\mathrm{Vol}_q(n,d-1)$ denotes the volume of a $q$-ary Hamming ball.\n  We further adapt this approach to the quantum setting by analyzing symplectic self-orthogonal structures. For $\u03b4<1-1/q^2$, we obtain an improved quantum GV bound: there exists a $q$-ary quantum code $[[n,\\,n-k,\\,d]]$ provided that $\\frac{q^{2n-k}-1}{q-1}<\\frac{c_\u03b4\\sqrt{n}\\cdot q^{2n}}{\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\\binom{n}{i}(q^2-1)^i}$.

Consecutive temporal modes are coupled by a passive orthogonal rotation that redistributes the displacement amplitude between slots, yielding a diversity order of two under independent fading and joint maximum-likelihood detection. Analytical expressions for the symbol-error rate performance, along with asymptotic results for the diversity and coding gains, are derived. The optimal rotation angle and energy allocation between displacement and squeezing are obtained in closed form.

In this work, we study how the placement of unreliable workers within the Numerically Stable Lagrange Coded Computing (NS-LCC) framework influences privacy and the ability to localize Byzantine errors. We derive analytical bounds that quantify how different evaluation-index assignments affect privacy against colluding curious workers and robustness against Byzantine corruption under finite-precision arithmetic. Using these bounds, we formulate optimization problems that identify privacy-optimal and robustness-optimal index placements and show that the resulting assignments are fundamentally different. This exposes that index choices that maximizes privacy degrade error-localization, and vice versa.

In this work, we introduce a new class of estimators called $p$-MAP estimators, which enable us to model the MAP estimator as a piecewise constant function with finitely many stages, bringing us closer to a full characterization of the MAP estimators when modeling information freshness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684p-MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u6587\u732e\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9785\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u63a5\u6536\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u867d\u7136\u9785\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6613\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u62c9\u53d6\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdc\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u5927\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387(MAP)\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u77e5\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684p-MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5c06MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u6570\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2dMAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7p-MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684p-MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u9785\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4e0eMAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
