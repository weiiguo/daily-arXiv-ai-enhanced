In this region, unlike in the far\nfield, the wavefront is nonplanar, which provides additional degrees of freedom\nto shape and steer the transmitted beam in a desired manner. In this paper, we\nfocus on Airy beams, which may exhibit several highly desirable properties in\nthe near-field region. Ideally, these beams follow self-accelerating (curved)\ntrajectories, demonstrate resilience to perturbations through self-healing, and\nmaintain a consistent intensity profile across all planes perpendicular to the\npropagation direction, making them effectively diffraction-free. Specifically,\nwe first present the underlying principles of self-accelerating beams radiated\nby continuous aperture field distributions. We then address several challenges\nregarding the generation of Airy beams, including their exponential decay due\nto finite energy constraints and spatial truncation of the aperture. Moreover,\nwe examine their free-space propagation characteristics. The second part of the\npaper focuses on the propagation behavior of Airy beams in non-line-of-sight\n(NLoS) scenarios. A comparison is also presented between Airy beams and\nGaussian beams. Our theoretical and numerical results show that Airy beams may\noffer a performance advantage over Gaussian beams in certain NLoS channels,\nprovided that their key properties are largely preserved, specifically,\nself-acceleration along a parabolic trajectory and diffraction-free\npropagation. In the presence of an obstacle, this requires that the portion of\nthe transmit aperture with a clear line-of-sight to the receiver is\nsufficiently large."}

This paper\ninvestigates a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output system that\nsimultaneously supports both transmission types, with multicast serving\nmultiple groups. Exact closed-form expressions for the achievable downlink\nspectral efficiency (SE) of both unicast and multicast users are derived for\nzero-forcing and maximum ratio precoding designs. Accordingly, a weighted sum\nSE (SSE) maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the access\npoint (AP) selection and power allocation. The optimization framework accounts\nfor practical constraints, including the maximum transmit power per AP,\nfronthaul capacity limitations between APs and the central processing unit, and\nquality-of-service requirements for all users. The resulting non-convex\noptimization problem is reformulated into a tractable structure, and an\naccelerated projected gradient (APG)-based algorithm is developed to\nefficiently obtain near-optimal solutions.

However, to fully\ncapitalize on the potential of CF-ISAC, accurate time synchronization (TS)\nbetween access points (APs) is critical. Due to the limitations of current\nsynchronization technologies, TS errors have become a significant challenge in\nthe development of the CF-ISAC system. In this paper, we propose a novel\nCF-ISAC architecture based on movable antennas (MAs), which exploits spatial\ndiversity to enhance communication rates, maintain sensing accuracy, and reduce\nthe impact of TS errors. We formulate a worst-case sensing accuracy\noptimization problem for TS errors to address this challenge, deriving the\nworst-case Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Subsequently, we develop a joint\noptimization framework for AP beamforming and MA positions to satisfy\ncommunication rate constraints while improving sensing accuracy. A robust\noptimization framework is designed for the highly complex and non-convex\nproblem. Specifically, we employ manifold optimization (MO) to solve the\nworst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem. Then, we propose an\nMA-enabled meta-reinforcement learning (MA-MetaRL) to design optimization\nvariables while satisfying constraints on MA positions, communication rate, and\ntransmit power, thereby improving sensing accuracy. The simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed robust optimization algorithm significantly\nimproves the accuracy of the detection and is strong against TS errors.\nMoreover, compared to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) technologies,\nthe proposed MA-aided CF-ISAC architecture achieves higher system capacity,\nthus validating its effectiveness."}

While previous work has explored numerical approaches to\napproximate the information RDP function, the lack of theoretical guarantees\nremains a major limitation, especially in the presence of complex perceptual\nconstraints that introduce non-convexity and computational intractability.\nInspired by our previous constrained Blahut-Arimoto algorithm for solving the\nrate-distortion function, in this paper, we present a new theoretical framework\nfor computing the information RDP function by relaxing the constraint on the\nreconstruction distribution and replacing it with an alternative optimization\napproach over the reconstruction distribution itself. This reformulation\nsignificantly simplifies the optimization and enables a rigorous proof of\nconvergence. Based on this formulation, we develop a novel primal-dual\nalgorithm with provable convergence guarantees. Our analysis establishes, for\nthe first time, a rigorous convergence rate of $O(1/n)$ for the computation of\nRDP functions. The proposed method not only bridges a key theoretical gap in\nthe existing literature but also achieves competitive empirical performance in\nrepresentative settings.

However, real deployments suffer from hardware impairments,\nespecially nonlinear distortion from power amplifiers (PAs), which degrades\nboth communication and sensing. To address this, we propose a movable antenna\n(MA)-aided CF-ISAC system that mitigates distortion and enhances robustness.\nThe PAs nonlinearities are modeled by a third-order memoryless polynomial,\nwhere the third-order distortion coefficients (3RDCs) vary across access points\n(APs) due to hardware differences, aging, and environmental conditions. We\ndesign a distributed distortion-aware worst-case robust optimization framework\nthat explicitly incorporates uncertainty in 3RDCs. First, we analyze the\nworst-case impact of PA distortion on both the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)\nand communication rate. Then, to address the resulting non-convexity, we apply\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) for estimating the 3RDCs. With these, we\njointly optimize beamforming and MA positions under transmit power and sensing\nconstraints. To efficiently solve this highly non-convex problem, we develop an\nMA-enabled self-attention convolutional graph neural network (SACGNN)\nalgorithm.

When a target\nemits a radio frequency (RF) signal, spatially distributed sensors can collect\nsignal measurements to estimate the target's location. Among various\nmeasurement modalities, received signal strength (RSS) is particularly\nattractive due to its low cost, low power consumption, and ease of deployment.\nWhile particle filtering has previously been applied to RSS-based target\nlocalization, few studies have systematically analyzed its performance under\nvarying sensor geometries and RSS noise levels. This paper addresses this gap\nby designing and evaluating a particle filtering algorithm for localizing a\nstationary target. The proposed method is compared with a conventional\nRSS-based trilateration approach across different sensor configurations and\nnoise conditions.

They\ncan be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent\nto the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with\namplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in\nrepeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive\nfeedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and\namplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be\nachieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more\ninterference?
