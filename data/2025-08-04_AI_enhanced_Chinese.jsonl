However, realizing the desired performance gains in FIM systems\nis critically dependent on acquiring accurate channel state information across\na continuous and high-dimensional deformation space. Therefore, this paper\ninvestigates this fundamental channel estimation problem for FIM assisted\nmillimeter-wave communication systems. First, we develop model-based frameworks\nthat structure the problem as either function approximation using interpolation\nand kernel methods or as a sparse signal recovery problem that leverages the\ninherent angular sparsity of millimeter-wave channels. To further advance the\nestimation capability beyond explicit assumptions in model-based channel\nestimation frameworks, we propose a deep learning-based framework using a\nFourier neural operator (FNO). By parameterizing a global convolution operator\nin the Fourier domain, we design an efficient FNO architecture to learn the\ncontinuous operator that maps FIM shapes to channel responses with\nmesh-independent properties. Furthermore, we exploit a hierarchical FNO (H-FNO)\narchitecture to efficiently capture the multi-scale features across a hierarchy\nof spatial resolutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed H-FNO\nsignificantly outperforms the model-based benchmarks in estimation accuracy and\npilot efficiency.

He developed a novel theory founded on a\ndistance metric and parabolic relation, designed to remove this paradox.\nUnfortunately is approach does not succeed in that aim.\n  In this paper I critique Floridi's theory of strongly semantic information on\nits own terms and show where it succeeds and fails. I then present a new\napproach based on the unit circle (a relation that has been the basis of\ntheories from basic trigonometry to quantum theory). This is used, by analogy\nwith von Neumann's quantum probability to construct a measure space for\ninformativeness that meets all the requirements stipulated by Floridi and\nremoves the paradox.

It is important for tasks such as\nspectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent\nyears, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However,\nmainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use\ntime-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key\nmodulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication\nconditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a\nlarge amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments.\nTo solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called\nRIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from\nunlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking\nand reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as\namplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable\nrepresentations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets.

To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel\nselective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the\noff-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different\nfrequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database. During the\non-line control stage, the incoming noise is decomposed using a polyphase FFT\nfilter bank, and a frequency-band-matching mechanism assigns each subband\nsignal the most appropriate control filter. Subsequently, a weight stacking\ntechnique is employed to combine all subband weights into a fullband filter,\nenabling real-time noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed scheme provides fast convergence, effective noise reduction, and\nstrong robustness in handling more complicated noisy environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65e0\u5b50\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u56fa\u5b9a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5747\u5300\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u566a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u56fa\u5b9a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65e0\u5b50\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b50\u5e26\u63a7\u5236\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u5e26\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u53e0\u52a0\u6280\u672f\u5408\u6210\u5168\u5e26\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u590d\u6742\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3001\u6709\u6548\u964d\u566a\u548c\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

High throughput\nsatellite (HTS) systems, utilizing multipoint beam and frequency multiplexing\ntechniques, enable satellite communication capacity of up to Tbps to meet the\ngrowing traffic demand. Therefore, it is imperative to review\nthe-state-of-the-art of multibeam HTS systems and identify their associated\nchallenges and perspectives. Firstly, we summarize the multibeam HTS hardware\nfoundations, including ground station systems, on-board payloads, and user\nterminals. Subsequently, we review the flexible on-board radio resource\nallocation approaches of bandwidth, power, time slot, and joint allocation\nschemes of HTS systems to optimize resource utilization and cater to\nnon-uniform service demand. Additionally, we survey multibeam precoding methods\nfor the HTS system to achieve full-frequency reuse and interference\ncancellation, which are classified according to different deployments such as\nsingle gateway precoding, multiple gateway precoding, on-board precoding, and\nhybrid on-board/on-ground precoding. Finally, we disscuss the challenges\nrelated to Q/V band link outage, time and frequency synchronization of\ngateways, the accuracy of channel state information (CSI), payload light-weight\ndevelopment, and the application of deep learning (DL). Research on these\ntopics will contribute to enhancing the performance of HTS systems and finally\ndelivering high-speed data to areas underserved by terrestrial networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u591a\u6ce2\u675f\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u536b\u661f\uff08HTS\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u786c\u4ef6\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6311\u6218\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u662f6G\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0cHTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6ce2\u675f\u548c\u9891\u7387\u590d\u7528\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0Tbps\u7ea7\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u603b\u7ed3\u5176\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86HTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u591a\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728Q/V\u9891\u6bb5\u94fe\u8def\u4e2d\u65ad\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u3001CSI\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u5c06\u63d0\u5347HTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u5730\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u901f\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u3002"}}
