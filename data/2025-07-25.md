### [1] [Action-List Reinforcement Learning Syndrome Decoding for Binary Linear Block Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17893)

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to
enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping
bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the
iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose
different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is
proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball
with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for
reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to
improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list
decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values
that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism
group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose
a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing
high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after
the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of
the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for
the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel
(BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

*Amirarsalan Moatazedian,Yauhen Yakimenka,Rémi A. Chou,Jörg Kliewer*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了一种隐私保护数据共享场景，通过优化私有化器在保证重构器失真低于阈值的同时，最大化两个对手的最小损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多方信息共享中，如何在保护隐私的同时允许授权方准确重构数据，同时防止未授权方通过协作恢复数据。

Method: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的极小极大优化问题框架，交替更新私有化器、重构器和对手。

Result: 在高斯和二进制两种特殊场景下获得了理论最优解，并作为基准评估了提出的极小极大训练方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护和数据共享之间取得了平衡，适用于需要协作才能恢复数据的场景。

Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer
transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized
reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side
information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each
adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures
the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing
the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models
cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their
combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold.
The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate
reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing
principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a
constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven
training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and
adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios
where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are
benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.

### [3] [Deep Learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation for Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17950)
*Jiajia Guo,Chao-Kai Wen,Xiao Li,Shi Jin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的PCEnet框架，利用用户位置信息提升无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统中的信道获取效率，减少开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为降低信道获取开销，利用用户位置作为桥梁，通过一个已获取的信道辅助估计其他信道。

Method: PCEnet通过神经网络从信道推断用户位置，并利用位置信息设计导频符号或直接重构其他信道，简化策略减少延迟。

Result: 仿真显示PCEnet将导频和反馈开销降低高达50%。

Conclusion: PCEnet通过位置域信道外推显著提升信道获取性能，适用于无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统。

Abstract: To reduce channel acquisition overhead, spatial, time, and frequency-domain
channel extrapolation techniques have been widely studied. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation
framework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel
characteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel
acquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments
between different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective
channels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique
across all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages
the position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the
characteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to
assist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach
first utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the
obtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central
processing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and
concatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to
reconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition
performance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the
estimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the
pilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position
label-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the
absolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during
the localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
PCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%.

### [4] [A Novel Coded Computing Approach for Distributed Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18025)
*Minquan Cheng,Yongkang Wang,Lingyu Zhang,Youlong Wu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型编码分布式多任务学习（DMTL）方案，显著降低通信成本，并在理论和实践中验证其最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模分布式多任务学习中，通信瓶颈限制了系统性能，需解决异构数据放置带来的挑战。

Method: 将通信过程建模为矩阵分解问题，提出编码DMTL方案，优化上下行链路的编码矩阵设计。

Result: 方案在理论和实践中均达到通信开销的理论下界，适用于同构和异构计算环境。

Conclusion: 该方案为分布式应用中异构数据放置问题提供了新思路，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Distributed multi-task learning (DMTL) effectively improves model
generalization performance through the collaborative training of multiple
related models. However, in large-scale learning scenarios, communication
bottlenecks severely limit practical system performance. In this paper, we
investigate the communication bottleneck within a typical DMTL system that
employs non-linear global updates. This system involves distributed workers,
assisted by a central server, who collaboratively learn distinct models derived
from a non-linear aggregation of their local model parameters. We first
characterize the communication process as a matrix decomposition problem. It
transforms workers' data storage constraints into structural characteristics of
the uplink encoding matrix, and worker data retrieval demands into Maximum
Distance Separable (MDS) properties of the downlink encoding matrix. Building
on this, we propose a novel coded DTML scheme that can greatly reduce the
communication cost of the DTML with heterogeneous data placement. Theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme achieves the theoretical lower
bound for communication overhead under mild conditions. Remarkably, this
optimality holds for both traditional homogeneous computing environments and
various heterogeneous scenarios. Furthermore, our scheme is extensible to a
distributed linearly separable computation problem where the target function
involves multiple linear combinations of local update values. This indicates
that our scheme offers a new way of tackling heterogeneous data placement
challenges in various distributed applications.

### [5] [Covert Communications in MEC-Based Networked ISAC Systems Towards Low-Altitude Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18194)
*Weihao Mao,Yang Lu,Bo Ai,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于移动边缘计算（MEC）的网络化集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统中的隐蔽传输设计，旨在优化无人机（UAV）的通信、感知和计算资源以及轨迹，以最小化总能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济（LAE）依赖ISAC、MEC和隐蔽通信，但现有研究未充分解决MEC网络中的隐蔽传输问题。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种交替优化算法，将问题分解为通信、感知和计算资源的联合优化以及无人机轨迹优化，分别通过逐次凸近似和信任域算法求解。

Result: 仿真验证了算法的有效性，并揭示了通信、感知和计算之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 该算法为LAE系统中的隐蔽传输提供了高效解决方案，并展示了资源优化的潜力。

Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging business model, which heavily
relies on integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), mobile edge computing
(MEC), and covert communications. This paper investigates the convert
transmission design in MEC-based networked ISAC systems towards LAE, where an
MEC server coordinates multiple access points to simultaneously receive
computation tasks from multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), locate a
target in a sensing area, and maintain UAVs' covert transmission against
multiple wardens. We first derive closed-form expressions for the detection
error probability (DEP) at wardens. Then, we formulate a total energy
consumption minimization problem by optimizing communication, sensing, and
computation resources as well as UAV trajectories, subject to the requirements
on quality of MEC services, DEP, and radar signal-to-interference-and-noise
ratio, and the causality of UAV trajectories. An alternating optimization based
algorithm is proposed to handle the considered problem, which decomposes it
into two subproblems: joint optimization of communication, sensing, and
computation resources, and UAV trajectory optimization. The former is addressed
by a successive convex approximation based algorithm, while the latter is
solved via a trust-region based algorithm. Simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with various benchmarks, and
reveal the trade-offs among communication, sensing, and computation in LAE
systems.

Abstract: We study the Hermitian hull of a particular family of generalized

translated to a counting problem in a lattice. By solving this problem, we
provide explicit formulas for the dimension of the hull, which determines the
minimum number required of maximally entangled pairs for the associated

### [7] [On the Role of Age and Semantics of Information in Remote Estimation of Markov Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18514)
*Jiping Luo,Nikolaos Pappas*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了有限状态马尔可夫链的语义感知远程估计，提出了一种基于MAP估计器的传输策略，结合AoCE和AoI优化估计性能。

Method: 采用CMDP建模，提出混合策略和阈值策略，开发了高效算法Insec-SPI。

Result: 结合AoCE和AoI显著提升了估计质量。

Conclusion: 混合策略和阈值策略在优化估计性能方面具有高效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the semantics-aware remote estimation of a
finite-state Markov chain. We employ the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator
and aim to devise a transmission policy to optimize estimation performance
subject to a transmission frequency constraint. We leverage two metrics, namely
the Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE) and the Age of Information (AoI), to
quantify, respectively, the significance of estimation error at the transmitter
and the predictability of outdated information at the receiver. The optimal
transmission problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP) with unbounded costs. We show the existence of an optimal simple mixture
policy, which randomly selects between two deterministic switching policies
with a fixed probability. Notably, each switching policy triggers a
transmission only when the AoCE exceeds a threshold value that depends on both
the AoI and the instantaneous estimation error. We further derive sufficient
conditions under which the switching policy reduces to a simple threshold
policy; that is, it admits identical thresholds for all estimation errors.
Leveraging these results, we develop an efficient structure-aware algorithm,
Insec-SPI, that computes the optimal policy with reduced computation overhead.
Our results demonstrate that incorporating both AoI and AoCE yields
significantly improved estimation quality compared to using either metric
alone.

### [8] [AI/ML Life Cycle Management for Interoperable AI Native RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18538)
*Chu-Hsiang Huang,Chao-Kai Wen,Geoffrey Ye Li*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI/ML在5G RAN中的应用及其标准化生命周期管理框架的演进，从3GPP Release 16到20的发展，并提出了未来6G的AI原生收发器的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI/ML在5G RAN中的应用面临模型漂移、供应商锁定和透明度不足等挑战，需标准化生命周期管理框架以推动大规模采用。

Method: 3GPP从Release 16到20逐步引入标准化接口，包括模型传输、执行、性能监控和闭环控制，形成五块生命周期管理架构。

Result: 3GPP Release 20实现了双面CSI压缩和供应商无关的生命周期管理配置，为AI原生收发器奠定基础。

Conclusion: 未来需解决资源高效监控、环境漂移检测、智能决策和灵活模型训练等挑战，以支持6G发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly
permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel
state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction.
However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework,
challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency,
hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML
from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions.
Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16,
subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer,
execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in
Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile.
This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven
monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while
identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift
detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These
developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for
6G.

### [9] [Time and Frequency Synchronization for Multiuser OTFS in Uplink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17966)
*Mohsen Bayat,Sanoopkumar P. S.,Arman Farhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了高移动性场景下上行多用户OTFS系统的时间和频率同步技术，重点解决定时偏移（TO）和载波频率偏移（CFO）的估计与校正问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高移动性场景中，准确估计和校正TO和CFO对多用户OTFS系统的性能至关重要。TO估计用于定位用户导频，CFO估计则提高信道估计精度。

Method: 提出两种TO估计技术：基于SU-PCP导频结构的相关技术和基于MU-PCP导频结构的滤波器组技术。随后提出一种CFO估计技术，将多维ML搜索问题简化为多个一维搜索问题，并采用CPF-BEM模型处理信道时变特性。

Result: 提出的技术能够有效估计和校正TO和CFO，提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 本文的技术为高移动性场景下的多用户OTFS系统提供了高效的时间和频率同步解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose time and frequency synchronization techniques for
uplink multiuser OTFS (MU-OTFS) systems in high-mobility scenarios. This work
focuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and
carrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for
locating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances
channel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an
existing multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot
(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix
(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs
different Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via
correlation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a
correlation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot
structure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is
proposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the
delay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO
estimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'
signals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical
threshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major
peak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest
peak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the
proposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique
reduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into
multiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the
Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to
effectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO
estimates for all the users.

*Pablo Ramírez-Espinosa,Cleofás Segura-Gómez,Ángel Palomares-Caballero,F. Javier López-Martínez,David Morales-Jiménez*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于超表面的流体天线系统（FAS）的完整分析模型，解决了电子可重构天线在理论建模上的挑战，并通过动态超表面天线（DMA）实现FAS概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子可重构天线在流体天线系统（FAS）中面临理论建模困难，限制了系统设计的理论指导。本文旨在通过超表面技术提供一种可行的分析模型。

Method: 利用电路理论重新表述FAS的信号模型，考虑超表面的电磁效应，并通过全波仿真验证模型的有效性。

Result: 模型与仿真结果吻合良好，且DMA实现的FAS性能接近理想化的位置灵活天线。

Conclusion: 提出的分析模型为FAS设计提供了理论支持，DMA是实现FAS的一种有效方法。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) have become a popular topic in the wireless
community as an effective yet simple means of exploiting spatial diversity. Due
to the limitations of physically moving radiating elements, electronically
reconfigurable antennas are emerging as practical implementations of FASs,
since changing the radiation pattern is functionally equivalent to physically
moving the device. However, electronically reconfigurable antennas pose a
challenge in terms of analytical modeling, often requiring full-wave
simulations or measurements for their characterization; this severely limits
the extraction of theoretical insights useful for system design. Motivated by
these difficulties and the growing interest in FASs, we propose in this paper a
complete analytical model for metasurface-based embodiments of FASs.
Specifically, we advocate for the implementation of the FAS concept through
dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), hitherto proposed as array replacements in
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We leverage circuit theory to
rewrite the conventional signal model of FASs in terms of admittance matrices
accounting for the electromagnetic effects inherent to metasurfaces. The model
is validated with full-wave simulations, showing good agreement. We further
illustrate how to apply the model for standard performance analysis, and
provide closed-form expressions for key metrics, including the resulting signal
covariance matrix. Results confirm that practical DMA-based FASs can achieve
similar performance to that of idealized implementations of position-flexible
antennas.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多主动STAR-RIS的集成感知与通信（ISAC）网络优化方法，通过联合优化基站波束成形和STAR-RIS反射/透射系数，最大化通信总速率，同时满足感知、安全和功率约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在多用户通信和感知目标探测的ISAC网络中，利用主动STAR-RIS提升性能，同时满足严格的感知、安全和功率限制。

Conclusion: 主动STAR-RIS在多任务ISAC网络中具有显著性能优势，为未来通信感知一体化设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network
empowered by multiple active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). A base station (BS) furnishes
downlink communication to multiple users while concurrently interrogating a
sensing target. We jointly optimize the BS transmit beamformer and the
reflection/transmission coefficients of every active STAR-RIS in order to
maximize the aggregate communication sum-rate, subject to (i) a stringent
sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, (ii) an
upper bound on the leakage of confidential information, and (iii) individual
hardware and total power constraints at both the BS and the STAR-RISs. The
resulting highly non-convex program is tackled with an efficient alternating
optimization (AO) framework. First, the original formulation is reformulated
into an equivalent yet more tractable representation and partitioned into
subproblems. The BS beamformer is updated in closed form via the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, whereas the STAR-RIS reflection and
transmission vectors are refined through successive convex approximation (SCA),
yielding a semidefinite program that is then solved via semidefinite
relaxation. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
delivers substantial sum-rate gains over passive-RIS and single STAR-RIS
baselines, all the while rigorously meeting the prescribed sensing and security
constraints.

*Jihong Huang,Rong Yang,Wei Gao,Xingqun Zhan,Zheng Yao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文通过几何分析扩展了直接位置估计（DPE）的理论框架，提出了卫星圆形多径偏差（SCMB）模型，量化了多径误差对CAF和PVT解的影响，并通过模拟和测试验证了模型的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在直接位置估计（DPE）中，多径误差的理论表征仍不足，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过几何分析量化多径误差对CAF和PVT解的影响，提出SCMB模型，并通过蒙特卡洛模拟和城市峡谷测试验证。

Result: 最大PVT偏差取决于各卫星通道中的最大多径误差，且PVT偏差随卫星仰角增加而增大。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从几何角度选择DPE卫星提供了参考，强调了高低仰角卫星组合的重要性。

Abstract: Direct Position Estimation (DPE) is a method that directly estimate position,
velocity, and time (PVT) information from cross ambiguity function (CAF) of the
GNSS signals, significantly enhancing receiver robustness in urban
environments. However, there is still a lack of theoretical characterization on
multipath errors in the context of DPE theory. Geometric observations highlight
the unique characteristics of DPE errors stemming from multipath and thermal
noise as estimation bias and variance respectively. Expanding upon the
theoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this
paper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying
the deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative
to the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)
model is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite
channels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established
through discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness
of the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo
simulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT
bias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite
channels. Additionally, the PVT bias increases with satellite elevation angles,
influenced by the CAF multipath bias projection. This serves as a reference for
selecting DPE satellites from a geometric standpoint, underscoring the
importance of choosing a balanced combination of high and low elevation angles
to achieve an optimal satellite geometry configuration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IM-DD系统中概率整形的有效应用仍存在问题，尤其是在有记忆效应的系统中。

Method: 采用动态选择性映射（DSLM）机制和修改的M-BCJR算法，控制信号包络以减少记忆效应引起的损伤。

Result: 在56GBaud PAM8系统中，接收灵敏度提高了1dB，且兼容典型概率幅度整形架构。

Conclusion: 该方案为有记忆效应的PPC IM-DD系统中概率整形的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Probabilistic shaping (PS) has attracted significant attention in
intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IM-DD) systems. However, due to the
unique system model and inherent constraints, the effective application of the
PS technique is still an open question in IM-DD systems, particularly in
systems with memory effects. In this paper, a novel indirect PS scheme tailored
for peak power constrained (PPC) IM-DD systems is proposed. The key idea lies
in strategically controlling the signal envelope to mitigate memory-induced
impairments, such as nonlinearity, overshoot, peak-to-average power ratio
enhancement, etc. The proposed scheme incorporates a dynamic selective mapping
(DSLM) mechanism at the transmitter, enabling an untypical bit-to-symbol
mapping in which the current symbol is not only determined by the current bits
pattern but also by previously generated symbols within a specified memory
length. At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR
algorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by
DSLM. Experimental verification in a 56GBaud PAM8 system demonstrates that the
proposed scheme exhibits 1dB receiver sensitivity improvement over 2km
single-mode fiber transmission. In addition, the proposed scheme has also been
demonstrated to be compatible with the typical probabilistic amplitude shaping
architecture, enabling a simple and fine-granularity rate adaptation
capability. To the best of our knowledge, this work opens a new sight for the
application of the PS technique in PPC IM-DD systems with memory effects.

*Jonas Elmiger,Gian Marti,Christoph Studer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SCHIEBER是一种针对多天线GNSS接收器的新方法，无需先验知识即可缓解干扰和欺骗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS信号易受干扰和欺骗攻击，现有方法需要先验知识或无法同时应对两种攻击。

Method: 采用自适应空间滤波技术缓解干扰，通过比较信号到达方向和伪距估计识别欺骗信号。

Result: 在GPS L1 C/A系统的模拟测试中，SCHIEBER有效缓解了干扰和欺骗攻击。

Conclusion: SCHIEBER为GNSS接收器提供了一种无需先验知识的抗干扰和抗欺骗解决方案。

Abstract: Modern positioning relies on radio signals from global navigation satellite
systems (GNSS). Their low receive power renders these radio signals susceptible
to jamming attacks, in which malicious transmitters emit strong interference to
disrupt signal acquisition. Moreover, GNSS are vulnerable to spoofing attacks,
in which malicious transmitters mimic legitimate satellites by transmitting
spurious GNSS signals. We propose SCHIEBER, a novel method for multi-antenna
GNSS receivers that mitigates jammers as well as spoofers without requiring any
prior knowledge of the receiver position or attack type: Jammers are mitigated
during signal acquisition using a recently developed adaptive spatial filtering
technique. Spoofers are identified and rejected after signal acquisition using
a novel approach that tests the consistency of acquired signals by comparing
their respective direction of arrival (DoA) and pseudorange estimates in a test
that is invariant with respect to the unknown receiver position. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our method using extensive simulations of a GPS L1 C/A system
under spoofing and jamming attacks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly
massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave),
introduces significant network complexity and computational demands.
Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer
performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are
usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model
(ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous
multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that
adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is
trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It
jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user
precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A
key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),
enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel
conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive
retraining. Furthermore, we employ the Dynamic Weight Averaging (DWA) algorithm
to dynamically balance the individual task losses during multi-task training,
ensuring efficient and stable learning across diverse objectives. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance
compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization
capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising
paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless
networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent
resource management.

Abstract: Efficient all-digital post-correction of low-resolution analog-to-digital
converters can be achieved by using Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The performance of a
LUT can be optimized by incorporating a parametric model for the expected input
signal, noise level, and interference signals. We evaluate three analytical
estimators for integration with parametrized LUTs, especially with applications
to low-resolution, non-linear, or wideband quantizers. We also propose several
approximations to improve tractability of the estimation problem for
Phase-Shift Keyed input signals and Linear Frequency Modulated interference
signals. Simulated results validate the ability of our estimator to recover the
instantaneous value of the desired input signal in real-time with a high degree
of accuracy. This includes cancellation of harmonic distortion that aliases
into the desired signal bandwidth from front-end saturation due to high-power
out-of-band interference. Our estimators are shown to achieve a significant
gain over conventional linear-filtering techniques while also being robust to
changes in input parameters, non-linear quantizers, and time-variant
interference sources. For a tone input quantized to 3 bits and estimated with a
fixed 12-tap model order we achieve $>$10 dB improvement in Mean Square Error
and $>$20 dBc improvement in Spurious-Free Dynamic Range.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.
