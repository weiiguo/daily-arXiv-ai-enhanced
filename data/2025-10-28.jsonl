By splitting each file into $F$ equal\npackets (i.e., the subpacketization level $F$) and letting each user cache a\nset of packets, the transmission load can be significantly reduced via coded\nmulticasting. It has been shown that a higher subpacketization level could\npotentially lead to a lower transmission load, as more packets can be combined\nfor efficient transmission. On the other hand, a larger $F$ indicates a higher\ncoding complexity and is problematic from a practical perspective when $F$ is\nextremely large. Despite many works attempting to design coded caching schemes\nwith low subpacketization levels, a fundamental problem remains open: What is\nthe minimum transmission load given any fixed subpacketization level? In this\npaper, we consider the classical cache-aided networks with identically uncoded\nplacement and one-shot delivery strategy, and investigate the fundamental\ntrade-off between the transmission load and the subpacketization level. We\npropose a \\emph{general} lower bound on the transmission load for any fixed\nsubpacketization by reformulating the centralized coded caching schemes via the\ncombinatorial structure of the corresponding placement delivery array. The\nlower bound also recovers existing optimality results for the bipartite graph\nscheme (including the well-known Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) scheme and the\nconjugate MN scheme) as well as the grouping bipartite graph scheme.\nFurthermore, by carefully exploiting the combinatorial structure and computing\nthe union size of sorted sets, we establish a new optimality result, i.e., the\npartition scheme can achieve the optimal rate-subpacketization trade-off."}

This paper addresses this challenge by studying the joint design of\nsampling, scheduling, and estimation policies for monitoring a correlated\nWiener process. Though this problem is coupled, we establish a separation\nprinciple and identify the joint optimal policy: the optimal fusion estimator\nis a weighted-sum fusion estimator conditioned on Age of Information (AoI), the\noptimal scheduler is a Maximum Age First (MAF) scheduler that prioritizes the\nmost stale source, and the optimal sampling can be designed given the optimal\nestimator and the MAF scheduler. To design the optimal sampling, we show that,\nunder the infinite-horizon average-cost criterion, optimizing AoI is equivalent\nto optimizing MSE under pull-based communications, despite the presence of\nstrong inter-sensor correlations.
