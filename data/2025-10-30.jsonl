Recent advancements in deep\nlearning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.\nHowever, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that\nnecessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered\ncomputing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless\nnetworks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for\ndistributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to\nperform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this\ninvestigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this\ndistributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying\nmodulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective\nof the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the\ncentralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate\nof 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around\n41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods\nexhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,\nthe initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while\nsubstantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized\nmodel. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature\nmap, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies\na substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach.\nThese findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly\nenhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of\nbandwidth-limited wireless networks."}

For Conv2d\nrealization via OTA computation, we propose and analyze two RIS-aided\ntransmission architectures: multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO), balancing transmission overhead and\nemulation performance. We jointly optimize all parameters, including the\ntransmitter precoder, receiver combiner, and RIS phase shifts, under practical\nconstraints such as transmit power budget and unit-modulus phase shift\nrequirements. We further extend the framework to ConvSD, which requires\ndistinct transmission strategies for depthwise and pointwise convolutions.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed AirCNN architectures can\nachieve satisfactory classification performance.

As satellite constellations grow denser and transmission\nresources remain limited, frequency reuse plays an increasingly important role\nin managing inter-user interference. In the multi-user downlink, precoding\nenables the reuse of frequencies across spatially separated users, greatly\nimproving spectral efficiency. The analytical calculation of suitable\nprecodings for perfect channel information is well studied, however, their\nperformance can quickly deteriorate when faced with, e.g., outdated channel\nstate information or, as is particularly relevant for satellite channels, when\nposition estimates are erroneous. Deriving robust precoders under imperfect\nchannel state information is not only analytically intractable in general but\noften requires substantial relaxations of the optimization problem or heuristic\nconstraints to obtain feasible solutions. Instead, in this paper we flexibly\nderive robust precoding algorithms from given data using reinforcement\nlearning. We describe how we adapt the applied Soft Actor-Critic learning\nalgorithm to the problem of downlink satellite beamforming and show numerically\nthat the resulting precoding algorithm adjusts to all investigated scenarios.\nThe considered scenarios cover both single satellite and cooperative\nmulti-satellite beamforming, using either global or local channel state\ninformation, and two error models that represent increasing levels of\nuncertainty.

To address this issue, this paper investigates blockage-resilient\nnear-field beam training based on self-accelerating Airy beam, which can\npropagate along a curved trajectory to circumvent obstacles. Specifically, we\nfirst analyze the trajectory of the Airy beam and the beam pattern at the\nreceiver using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook in the presence of\nobstacles.
