In addition, while the SMLC formulation is motivated by connections to statistical mechanics, we provide a purely algebraic derivation of the underlying duality based on MacWilliams duality and Fourier analysis.

At the receiver, optimal decoding is desirable, yet challenging under non-Gaussian input distributions (video, voice, etc), for which neither the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator nor the mutual information admits a closed form. A further open question is whether knowledge of Channel State Information (CSI) and noise statistics at the intermediate relays is necessary for optimal detection. Aiming for an optimal decoder, this paper introduces a new framework that interprets the AF relay chain as a variance-preserving diffusion process and employs denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) for signal recovery. We show that each AF hop is mathematically equivalent to a diffusion step with hop-dependent attenuation and noise injection. Consequently, the entire multi-hop chain collapses to an equivalent Gaussian channel fully described by only three real scalars per block: the cumulative complex gain and the effective noise variance. At the receiver, these end-to-end sufficient statistics define a matched reverse schedule that guides the DDIM-based denoiser, enabling near-optimal Bayesian decoding without per-hop CSI. We establish the information-theoretic foundation of this equivalence, proving that decoding performance depends solely on the final effective Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), regardless of intermediate noise/channel allocation or prior distribution. Simulations under AWGN and Rician fading confirm that the proposed AF-DDIM decoder reduces mean-squared error, symbol error rate, and bit error rate, particularly at moderate SNRs and for higher-order constellations."}

In this paper, the term ``sensing'' refers to the receiver-side identifiability of a small set of dominant delay--Doppler path parameters, quantified via CRLB-type proxies, rather than a full-fledged target-sensing pipeline. Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) provides a sparse delay--Doppler (DD) representation well suited to such channels, yet most existing AFDM designs assume ideal CSI, operate on grid-based channel coefficients, and optimize only communication performance. This paper proposes a two-stage AFDM-based ISAC framework for mobile LEO ISLs that explicitly operates under predicted CSI. In Stage~I, we model the channel by a small number of dominant specular paths and perform sequence prediction directly on their complex gains, delays, and Dopplers, from which we reconstruct the AFDM DD-domain kernel used as the sole instantaneous CSI at the transmitter. In Stage~II, we design a sensing-aware AFDM pre-equalizer by augmenting the classical minimum mean-square error (MMSE) solution with a term obtained from Cramér--Rao-type sensitivity measures evaluated under the predicted channel model, leading to a first-order surrogate of a CRLB-regularized pre-equalizer with a single tuning parameter that controls the communication--sensing tradeoff. Simulation results for representative LEO ISL trajectories show that the proposed path-level predictor improves effective-kernel reconstruction over AFDM-unaware baselines, and that, under predicted CSI, the sensing-aware pre-equalizer significantly improves sensing-oriented metrics over outdated-CSI baselines while keeping symbol error rates close to a communication-oriented MMSE design with only modest additional complexity."}

Defining complexity and actually measuring it is an ongoing debate and no standard framework has been established that is both theoretically sound and computationally practical to use. Currently, one of the fields which attempts to formally define complexity is in the realm of Algorithmic Information Theory. The field has shown advances by studying the outputs of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional Turing machines to determine the complexity values of binary strings and 2-dimensional binary matrices respectively. Using these complexity values, an algorithm called the Block Decomposition Method developed by Zenil, et al. in 2018, has been created to approximate the complexity of adjacency matrices of graphs which has found relative success in grouping graphs based on their complexity values. We use this method along with another method called edge perturbation to exhaustively determine if an edge can be identified to connect two sub-graphs within a graph using the entire symmetric group of its vertices permutation and via unique permutations we call automorphic subsets, which is a special subset of the symmetric group. We also analyze if edges will be grouped closer to their respective sub-graphs in terms of the average algorithmic information contribution. This analysis has been done in order to ascertain if Algorithmic Information Theory can be a viable theory in understanding substructures within graphs and ultimately as a foundation to create frameworks of measuring and analyzing complexity."}

Understanding how information, and its counterpart, uncertainty, propagates is central to predictability studies and has significant implications for applications such as forecast uncertainty quantification and risk management. It also offers valuable insight into the underlying physics of the system. Information propagation is closely linked to causality: how one part of a system influences another, and how some regions remain dynamically isolated. We apply this framework to the one-dimensional, highly nonlinear Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model and to the shallow-water equations, representing a mid-latitude atmospheric strip. Notably, we observe that information can propagate against the fluid flow, and that different model variables exhibit distinct patterns of information evolution. For example, pressure-related information propagates differently from relative vorticity, reflecting the influence of gravity waves versus balanced flow dynamics. This new framework offers a promising addition to the diagnostic tools available for studying complex dynamical systems."}

Existing deep learning (DL) approaches to temporal modeling face challenges in jointly capturing these dynamics over long fMRI time series. Among current DL models, transformers address long-range dependencies by explicitly modeling pairwise interactions through attention, but the associated quadratic computational cost limits effective integration of temporal dependencies across long fMRI sequences. Selective state-space models (SSMs) instead model long-range temporal dependencies implicitly through latent state evolution in a dynamical system, enabling efficient propagation of dependencies over time. However, recent SSM-based approaches for fMRI commonly operate on derived functional connectivity representations and employ single-scale temporal processing. These design choices constrain the ability to jointly represent fast transient dynamics and slower global trends within a single model. We propose NeuroSSM, a selective state-space architecture designed for end-to-end analysis of raw BOLD signals in fMRI time series. NeuroSSM addresses the above limitations through two complementary design components: a multiscale state-space backbone that captures fast and slow dynamics concurrently, and a parallel differencing branch that increases sensitivity to transient state changes. Experiments on clinical and non-clinical datasets demonstrate that NeuroSSM achieves competitive performance and efficiency against state-of-the-art fMRI analysis methods."}

While most existing studies assume ideal environments without obstacles, practical indoor deployments are often obstacle-rich, where LoS blockage significantly degrades performance. This paper investigates pinching-antenna systems in blockage-aware environments by developing a deterministic model for cylinder-shaped obstacles that precisely characterizes LoS conditions without relying on stochastic approximations. Based on this model, a special case is first studied where each PA serves a single user and can only be deployed at discrete positions along the waveguide. In this case, the waveguide-user assignment is obtained via the Hungarian algorithm, and PA positions are refined using a surrogate-assisted block-coordinate search. Then, a general case is considered where each PA serves all users and can be continuously placed along the waveguide. In this case, beamforming and PA positions are jointly optimized by a weighted minimum mean square error integrated deep deterministic policy gradient (WMMSE-DDPG) approach to address non-smooth LoS transitions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly improve system throughput and LoS connectivity compared with benchmark methods.

In particular, the new selection gain can be achieved by leveraging the dynamic working mode selection between connection and reflection modes, whereas low-complexity element configuration remains an open issue. In this paper, we consider a RDARS-assisted communication system, where the connected elements are formed as a uniform sparse array for simplified mode configuration while achieving enlarged physical array aperture. The sum rate maximization problem is then formulated by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamforming matrices and sparsity of connected element array. For the special cases of a single user equipment (UE) and two UEs, the optimal sparsity designs are derived in closed-form. Then, for an arbitrary number of UEs, a weighted minimum mean-square error-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to tackle the non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of optimizing the sparsity and the effectiveness of low-complexity sparsity optimization."}

While prior studies have shown that lossless and reciprocal MiLAC can achieve the same capacity as digital beamforming in a single-user MIMO network, its performance in multi-user scenarios remains unknown. To answer this question, in this work, we establish a downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) network with a MiLAC-aided transmitter, and investigate its sum-rate performance. Based on the microwave network theory, we first prove that lossless and reciprocal MiLAC cannot achieve the same performance as digital beamforming in a general MU-MISO network. Then, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem and develop an efficient optimization framework to jointly optimize the power allocation and the scattering matrix for MiLAC. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that MiLAC is a promising architecture for future extremely large-scale MIMO systems."}

Specifically, we propose a novel AF domain pilot embedding scheme for satellite-ground downlink OFDM systems for capturing the channel characteristics. By exploiting the autoregressive (AR) property of adjacent channels, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based predictor is designed to replace conventional interpolation operation in OFDM channel estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed transmission scheme significantly outperforms conventional OFDM scheme in terms of bit error rate (BER) under high Doppler scenarios, thus paving a new way for the design of next generation non-terrestrial network (NTN) communication systems."}

This paper proposes a novel generative SSBF (GenSSBF) solution, which represents a paradigm shift from conventional unstructured prediction to joint-structure modeling. First, considering the fundamental differences between beam generation and conventional image synthesis, a unified GenSSBF framework is proposed, which includes a site profile, a wireless prompting module, and a generator. Second, a beam-brainstorm (BBS) solution is proposed as an instantiation of this GenSSBF framework. Specifically, the site profile is configured by transforming channel data from spatial domain to a reversible latent space via discrete Fourier transform (DFT). To facilitate practical deployment, the wireless prompt is constructed from the reference signal received power (RSRP) measured using a small number of DFT-beams. Finally, the generator is developed using a customized conditional diffusion model. Rather than relying on a meticulously designed global codebook, BBS directly generates diverse and high-fidelity user-specific beams guided by the wireless prompts. Simulation results on accurate ray-tracing datasets demonstrate that BBS can achieve near-optimal beamforming gain while drastically reducing the beam sweeping overhead, even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments."}

The impact of the number of tags and their phase adjustment on system performance remains a challenging issue though. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the channel gain of backscatter-assisted communication with multiple tags in straight tunnels. In particular, we derive the probabilities that the backscatter link gain is greater than the direct link under adjustable and random phase assumptions by applying the Gaussian and Gamma approximations to derive tractable expressions. The simulation results show that phaseadjustable tags significantly improve the channel gain of the backscatter links compared to the random phase case. Moreover, the number of tags has an upper threshold for an effective tag deployment pattern. These insights provide valuable guidelines for the efficient design of backscatter communication systems in tunnel environments."}

The platform comprises a semi-passive tag, a software-defined radio (SDR) reader, and a 2x1 planar Yagi-Uda array (7 dBi with higher than 30 dB isolation) operating at 2.4 ~ 2.5 GHz. The developed backscatter fading model accounts for round-trip propagation and temporal correlation, and employs an analytically derived resource-optimal pilot allocation strategy. At the receiver, optimized least square (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) CE with pilot-aided carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation feed a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer to suppress ISI. The prototype delivers 500 kbps at 1 m with power of 158 uW (SDR baseband) and 10 uW (RF switch), yielding 320 pJ/bit. OOK and BPSK modulations achieve measured EVMs of 2.97 % and 4.02 %, respectively. Performance is validated by BER measurements and successful reconstruction of a full-color image in an over-the-air experiment. The results demonstrate an ultra-low-power, multimedia-capable backscatter IoT link and provide practical hardware-software co-design guidance for scalable deployments."}

At the receiver, optimal decoding is desirable, yet challenging under non-Gaussian input distributions (video, voice, etc), for which neither the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator nor the mutual information admits a closed form. A further open question is whether knowledge of Channel State Information (CSI) and noise statistics at the intermediate relays is necessary for optimal detection. Aiming for an optimal decoder, this paper introduces a new framework that interprets the AF relay chain as a variance-preserving diffusion process and employs denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) for signal recovery. We show that each AF hop is mathematically equivalent to a diffusion step with hop-dependent attenuation and noise injection. Consequently, the entire multi-hop chain collapses to an equivalent Gaussian channel fully described by only three real scalars per block: the cumulative complex gain and the effective noise variance. At the receiver, these end-to-end sufficient statistics define a matched reverse schedule that guides the DDIM-based denoiser, enabling near-optimal Bayesian decoding without per-hop CSI. We establish the information-theoretic foundation of this equivalence, proving that decoding performance depends solely on the final effective Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), regardless of intermediate noise/channel allocation or prior distribution. Simulations under AWGN and Rician fading confirm that the proposed AF-DDIM decoder reduces mean-squared error, symbol error rate, and bit error rate, particularly at moderate SNRs and for higher-order constellations."}
