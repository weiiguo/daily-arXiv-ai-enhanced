For example, the coding technique used to fortify data in a modern storage system when the device is fresh cannot be the same as that used when the device ages. Therefore, providing reconfigurable coding schemes and devising an effective way to perform this reconfiguration are key to extending the device lifetime. We focus on constrained coding schemes for the emerging two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) technology. Recently, we have designed efficient lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) coding schemes for various stages of the TDMR device lifetime, focusing on the elimination of isolation patterns, and demonstrated remarkable gains by using them. LOCO codes are naturally reconfigurable, and we exploit this feature in our work. Reconfiguration based on predetermined time stamps, which is what the industry adopts, neglects the actual device status. Instead, we propose offline and online learning methods to perform this task based on the device status. In offline learning, training data is assumed to be available throughout the time span of interest, while in online learning, we only use training data at specific time intervals to make consequential decisions. We fit the training data to polynomial equations that give the bit error rate in terms of TD density, then design an optimization problem in order to reach the optimal reconfiguration decisions to switch from a coding scheme to another. The objective is to maximize the storage capacity and/or minimize the decoding complexity. The problem reduces to a linear programming problem. We show that our solution is the global optimal based on problem characteristics, and we offer various experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in TDMR systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eTDMR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u65b0\u9c9c\u65f6\u4e0e\u8001\u5316\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5ef6\u957f\u8bbe\u5907\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u7528\u6574\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u4f7f\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u62df\u5408\u4e3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08\u6bd4\u7279\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e0eTD\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u6027\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728TDMR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u8bbe\u5907\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5207\u6362\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf/\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0TDMR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5ef6\u957f\u8bbe\u5907\u5bff\u547d\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the deployment of existing antenna placement schemes is primarily hindered by their limited scalability and frequently overlooked near-field effects in large-scale antenna systems. In this paper, we propose a novel antenna placement approach tailored for near-field massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, which effectively exploits the spatial DoFs to enhance spectral efficiency. For that purpose, we first reformulate the antenna placement problem in the angular domain, resulting in a weighted Fekete problem. We then derive the optimality condition and reveal that the {optimal} antenna placement is in principle an electrostatic equilibrium problem. To further reduce the computational complexity of numerical optimization, we propose an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based framework to efficiently solve the equilibrium problem. In particular, the optimal antenna positions are characterized by the roots of the polynomial solutions to specific ODEs in the normalized angular domain. By simply adopting a two-step eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) approach, the optimal antenna positions can be efficiently obtained. Furthermore, we perform an asymptotic analysis when the antenna size tends to infinity, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently harnesses the spatial DoFs of near-field channels with prominent gains in spectral efficiency and maintains robustness against system parameter mismatches. In addition, the derived asymptotic closed-form {solution} closely approaches the theoretical optimum across a wide range of practical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd1\u573a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u5e03\u7f6e\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5929\u7ebf\u5e03\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a0\u6743Fekete\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ODE\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5929\u7ebf\u5e03\u7f6e\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u8fd1\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u8fd1\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5929\u7ebf\u5e03\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u89d2\u5ea6\u57df\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u52a0\u6743Fekete\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u672c\u8d28\u4e3a\u9759\u7535\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b(ODE)\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b65\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5206\u89e3(EVD)\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u4f18\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u5230\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd1\u573a\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u5931\u914d\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u5e03\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9759\u7535\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5229\u7528ODE\u6846\u67b6\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd1\u573a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The network operates in a time-slotted fashion to serve content-requesting users by streaming cached files. The users being unsatisfied by the multicat streaming face a delivery outage, implying that they will remain interested in their preference at the next time-slot, which leads to a forward dynamics on the user preference. To design a latency-optimal streaming policy, the dynamics of latency is properly modeled and included in the learning procedure. We show that this dynamics surprisingly represents a backward dynamics. The combination of problem's forward and backward dynamics then develops a forward-backward Markov decision process (FB-MDP) that fully captures the network evolution across time. This FB-MDP necessitates usage of a forward-backward multi-objective reinforcement learning (FB-MORL) algorithm to optimize the expected latency as well as other performance metrics of interest including the overall outage probability and total resource consumption.

First, extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) usually face a variety of hardware impairments (HIs) that may introduce unknown phase and/or amplitude errors. Second, the existing block coordinate descent (BCD)-based methods for joint estimation of the HI indicator, channel gain, angle, and range may induce considerable target localization error when the target is very close to the XL-array. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a new three-phase HI-aware near-field localization method, by efficiently detecting faulty antennas and estimating the positions of targets. Specifically, we first determine faulty antennas by using compressed sensing (CS) methods and improve detection accuracy based on coarse target localization. Then, a dedicated phase calibration method is designed to correct phase errors induced by detected faulty antennas. Subsequently, an efficient near-field localization method is devised to accurately estimate the positions of targets based on the full XL-array with phase calibration. Additionally, we resort to the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) to quantify the performance loss caused by HIs. Last, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces the localization errors as compared to various benchmark schemes, especially for the case with a short target range and/or a high fault probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6545\u969c\u5929\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3XL\u9635\u5217\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fd1\u573a\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9635\u5217\u9762\u4e34\u5404\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u672a\u77e5\u76f8\u4f4d/\u5e45\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u9760\u8fd1\u9635\u5217\u65f6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6545\u969c\u5929\u7ebf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c97\u7565\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u7528\u76f8\u4f4d\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6821\u6b63\u6545\u969c\u5929\u7ebf\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b3\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u573a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f4d\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u9635\u5217\u7cbe\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u8bef\u8bbeCramer-Rao\u754c\u91cf\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u8ddd\u79bb\u8f83\u77ed\u548c/\u6216\u6545\u969c\u6982\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6545\u969c\u5929\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9635\u5217\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a potential technology of next-generation communications due to its remarkable advantages in spectrum efficiency and user access capability. The integration of PA and NOMA enables synergistic leveraging of PA's channel regulation capability and NOMA's multi-user multiplexing advantage, forming a complementary technical framework to deliver high-performance communication solutions. However, the use of successive interference cancellation (SIC) introduces significant security risks to power-domain NOMA systems when internal eavesdropping is present. To this end, this paper investigates the physical layer security of a PA-aided NOMA system where a nearby user is considered as an internal eavesdropper. We enhance the security of the NOMA system through optimizing the radiated power of PAs and analyze the secrecy performance by deriving the closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP). Furthermore, we extend the characterization of PA flexibility beyond deployment and scale adjustment to include flexible regulation of PA coupling length. Based on two conventional PA power models, i.e., the equal power model and the proportional power model, we propose a flexible power strategy to achieve secure transmission. The results highlight the potential of the PA-aided NOMA system in mitigating internal eavesdropping risks, and provide an effective strategy for optimizing power allocation and cell range of user activity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7684NOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u7a83\u542c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u529f\u7387\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf(PA)\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u8c03\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\uff0cNOMA\u5177\u6709\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u5165\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u4e92\u8865\u6280\u672f\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u4f46NOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e32\u884c\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664(SIC)\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u7a83\u542c\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76PA\u8f85\u52a9\u7684NOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "1. \u8003\u8651\u9644\u8fd1\u7528\u6237\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u7684PA\u8f85\u52a9NOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316PA\u8f90\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff1b3. \u63a8\u5bfc\u4fdd\u5bc6\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387(SOP)\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u80fd\uff1b4. \u6269\u5c55PA\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5230\u8026\u5408\u957f\u5ea6\u8c03\u63a7\uff1b5. \u57fa\u4e8e\u7b49\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u529f\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u7075\u6d3b\u529f\u7387\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "1. \u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fdd\u5bc6\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u529f\u7387\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b3.

Conventional SAR systems typically leverages a deterministic radar waveform, while it conflicts with the integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigm by discarding signaling randomness, in whole or in part. In fact, this approach reduces to the uplink pilot sensing in 5G New Radio (NR) with sounding reference signals (SRS), underutilizing data symbols. To explore the potential of data-aided imaging, we develop a low-altitude SAR imaging framework that sufficiently leverages data symbols carried by the native orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication waveform. The randomness of modulated data in the temporal-frequency (TF) domain, introduced by non-constant modulus constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), may however severely degrade the imaging quality. To mitigate this effect, we incorporate several TF-domain filtering schemes within a rangeDoppler (RD) imaging framework and evaluate their impact. We further propose using the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of a reference point target's profile as an imaging performance metric. Simulation results with 5G NR parameters demonstrate that data-aided imaging substantially outperforms pilot-only counterpart, accordingly validating the effectiveness of the proposed OFDM-SAR imaging approach in LAWNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc(LAWNs)\u7684OFDM-SAR\u6210\u50cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528OFDM\u901a\u4fe1\u6ce2\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u96f7\u8fbe\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5bfc\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6210\u50cf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f7d\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u96f7\u8fbe(SAR)\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edfSAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96f7\u8fbe\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u4e0e\u901a\u611f\u4e00\u4f53\u5316(ISAC)\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u30025G NR\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u5bfc\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u63a2\u6d4b\u53c2\u8003\u4fe1\u53f7(SRS)\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f4e\u7a7aSAR\u6210\u50cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528OFDM\u901a\u4fe1\u6ce2\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\u9488\u5bf9QAM\u7b49\u975e\u6052\u6a21\u8c03\u5236\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u591a\u666e\u52d2(RD)\u6210\u50cf\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee(NMSE)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6210\u50cf\u6027\u80fd\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e5G NR\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8f85\u52a9\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5bfc\u9891\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684OFDM-SAR\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684OFDM-SAR\u6210\u50cf\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5229\u7528\u4e86OFDM\u901a\u4fe1\u6ce2\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u8fdb\u884cSAR\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6848\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8c03\u5236\u6570\u636e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bf9\u6210\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u611f\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To achieve high-accuracy multi-target estimation, we propose a two-stage sensing framework combining non-coherent and coherent maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation. In parallel, adaptive AP mode-selection strategies are introduced to balance communication and sensing performance: a communication-centric scheme that maximizes downlink spectral efficiency (SE) and a sensing-centric scheme that selects geometrically diverse receive APs to enhance sensing coverage. Simulation results confirm the SE-sensing trade-off, where appropriate power allocation between communication and sensing and larger array apertures alleviate performance degradation, achieving high SE with millimeter-level sensing precision. We further demonstrate that the proposed AP-selection strategy reveals an optimal number of receive APs that maximizes sensing coverage without significantly sacrificing SE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AP\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u5982\u4f55\u534f\u540c\u670d\u52a1\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u4e2a\u9759\u6001\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AP\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0b\u884c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff09\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u9009\u62e9\u51e0\u4f55\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u63a5\u6536AP\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9635\u5217\u5b54\u5f84\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1bAP\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a5\u6536AP\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AP\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

For the first time, we formulate the signal model for MSMS beamspace MIMO transmission. Under synchronization errors, multi-antenna UTs enable the distributed MIMO channel to exhibit higher rank, supporting multiple data streams. Beamspace MIMO retains conventional codebook based beamforming while providing the performance gains of precoding. Based on the signal model, we propose statistical channel state information (sCSI)-based optimization of satellite clustering, beam selection, and transmit precoding, using a sum-rate upper-bound approximation. With given satellite clustering and beam selection, we cast precoder design as an equivalent covariance decomposition-based weighted minimum mean square error (CDWMMSE) problem. To obtain tractable algorithms, we develop a closed-form covariance decomposition required by CDWMMSE and derive an iterative MSMS beam-domain precoder under sCSI. Following this, we further propose several heuristic closed-form precoders to avoid iterative cost. For satellite clustering, we enhance a competition-based algorithm by introducing a mechanism to regulate the number of satellites serving certain UT. Furthermore, we design a two-stage low-complexity beam selection algorithm focused on enhancing the effective channel power. Simulations under practical configurations validate the proposed methods across the number of data streams, receive antennas, serving satellites, and active beams, and show that beamspace transmission approaches conventional MIMO performance at lower complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u536b\u661f\u591a\u6d41\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1CSI\u7684\u536b\u661f\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f20\u7edfMIMO\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u536b\u661f\u534f\u4f5c\u5f62\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u8f93\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u7403\u79fb\u52a8\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u57df\u9884\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u7528\u6237\u7ec8\u7aef\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u9053\u79e9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f20\u7edf\u7801\u672c\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acbMSMS\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4MIMO\u4f20\u8f93\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1CSI\u7684\u536b\u661f\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5c06\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b49\u6548\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u52a0\u6743\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u95ed\u5f0f\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6ce2\u675f\u57df\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u95ed\u5f0f\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u907f\u514d\u8fed\u4ee3\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u536b\u661f\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6ce2\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6570\u3001\u63a5\u6536\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u536b\u661f\u6570\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6ce2\u675f\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u8f93\u80fd\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f20\u7edfMIMO\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MSMS\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u8f93\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u548c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u536b\u661fMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}
