However, this sequential design approach does not fully\naddress the trade-offs between high-frequency and LDO-induced low-frequency\nphase noise. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a co-design\nmethod for low phase-noise LC-tank VCOs powered by LDOs. It is difficult to\ncarry out the co-design using traditional manual design techniques. Hence, an\nefficient AI-driven EDA algorithm is used. To validate the proposed method, a\n5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO with an integrated LDO is designed using a 65 nm CMOS\nprocess.

This corresponds to the Nyquist\nsignaling and is achieved by mounting information symbols on $BT$-dimensional\nbasis spanning the $BT$-dimensional space spaced $\\frac{1}{B}$ and\n$\\frac{1}{T}$ apart. Faster-than-Nyquist signaling involves transmitting more\nthan $BT$ informational symbols in a $BT$-dimensional space. This leads to loss\nof orthogonality. This is achieved by time and/or bandwidth expansion resulting\nfrom packing more information symbols in the same $BT$-dimensional space\n(spacing less than $\\frac{1}{B}$ and/or $\\frac{1}{T}$). In this paper, we take\na different approach to faster-than-Nyquist signaling. We propose to\nsuperimpose the information symbols on one another maintaining the original\nspacing in the Nyquist signaling. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS)\nmodulation. In Zak-OTFS, the channel varies slowly. Further Zak-OTFS also\nallows construction of mutually unbiased bases the interference between which\nappear like Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme leverages the slow variation in\nthe DD channel to construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the\ndoubly-spread channel. Further, in the proposed scheme we mount information\nsymbols on two mutually unbiased bases which allows superposition of\ninformation symbols. This simplifies receiver processing to detection in\nGaussian noise since each basis appears to the other as Gaussian noise. This\nreduction makes it possible to use trellis coded modulation to enhance\nbit-error performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nfaster-than-Nyquist signaling scheme achieves similar uncoded performance as\nthat of Nyquist signaling and with coding the performance is better than\nNyquist signaling at high signal-to-noise ratios."}
