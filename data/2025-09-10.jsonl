In this paper, we propose an\nenhanced stack decoding algorithm for PAC codes that significantly improves\nparallelization by exploiting specialized bit nodes, such as rate-0 and rate-1\nnodes. For a rate-1 node with $N_0$ leaf nodes in its corresponding subtree,\nconventional stack decoding must either explore all $2^{N_0}$ paths, or, same\nas in fast list decoding, restrict attention to a constant number of candidate\npaths. In contrast, our approach introduces a pruning technique that discards\nwrong paths with a probability exponentially approaching zero, retaining only\nthose whose path metrics remain close to their expected mean values.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel approximation method for estimating variance\npolarization under the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN)\nchannel. Leveraging these approximations, we develop an efficient stack-pruning\nstrategy that selectively preserves decoding paths whose bit-metric values\nalign with their expected means. This targeted pruning substantially reduces\nthe number of active paths in the stack, thereby decreasing both decoding\nlatency and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that for a\nPAC(128,64) code, our method achieves up to a 70% reduction in the average\nnumber of paths without degrading error-correction performance."}

A unified\nplatform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate\nfrequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,\nintegrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly\noptimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant\ncomputational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or\noptimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,\nDL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced\ncomputational complexity.

This work presents a machine learning pipeline incorporating robust\npreprocessing, physiologically grounded feature extraction, and rigorous\nevaluation. Features were extracted from EHG (and TOCO) signals using Mel\nfrequency cepstral coefficients, statistical descriptors of wavelet\ncoefficients, and peaks of the normalized power spectrum. Signal quality was\nenhanced via Karhunen Lo\\`eve Transform (KLT) denoising through eigenvalue\nbased subspace decomposition. Multiple classifiers, including Logistic\nRegression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,\nMultilayer Perceptron, and CatBoost, were evaluated on the TPEHGT dataset. The\nCatBoost classifier with KLT denoising achieved the highest performance on\nfixed interval segments of the TPEHGT dataset, reaching 97.28% accuracy and an\nAUC of 0.9988. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of both KLT\ndenoising and physiologically informed features.

Our framework\nutilizes MLLMs to identify the scenario-augmented (SA) semantic importance for\nobjects within the image. Through knowledge distillation with the\nMLLM-annotated data, our vectorization/de-vectorization networks and JSCC\nencoder/decoder learn to dynamically allocate coding resources based on\ncontextual significance, i.e., distinguishing between high-importance objects\nand low-importance according to the SA scenario information of the task.

Consequently, MESAs are least robust to\nsensor failures and cannot afford the failure of even a single sensor.\nMultifold redundant sparse arrays (MFRSAs) provide a practical solution to the\nproblem of sensor failures in sparse arrays by making sure that the array\ncontains enough sensor pairs necessary to produce each spatial lag multiple\ntimes. Owing to this property, a \\b{eta}-fold redundant array can withstand\nsimultaneous failure of at least \\b{eta}-1 sensors without losing the hole-free\nDCA property. Nevertheless, MFRSAs are also prone to hidden dependencies that\nprevent them from being fully robust.

To reduce movement overhead, we configure antenna\npositions at the antenna initialization stage, which remain unchanged during\nthe whole communication period of the ground station.
