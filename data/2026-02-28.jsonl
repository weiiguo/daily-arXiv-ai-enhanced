For clustered channels, which represent a typical type ofwireless propagation environment, there has been no researchdevoted to designing an appropriate CKM to enhance theirestimation. To exploit environment information for clusteredchannel, improve channel estimation accuracy and reduce pilotoverhead, we propose ClusterCKM, a CKM providing the rangeof clustered multipath parameters for any pair of transmitter-receiver links in the region of interest. Firstly, we construct Clus-terCKM through estimating the spatial range of scatterer clustersfrom historical channel information. From these spatial range ofscatterer clusters, ClusterCKM infers the range of multipathparameters for the target link. Furthermore, a ClusterCKM-based channel estimation algorithm is developed to utilize theparameter range provided by ClusterCKM. Simulation resultsshow that, more accurate channel estimation can be achievedand pilot overhead can also be reduced by ClusterCKM and theClusterCKM-based estimation algorithm."}

This work improves the reliability and efficiency of the estimation process by decomposing the overall optimization problem into a sequence of tractable subproblems. Based on an initial linear model, nonlinear residual dynamics are first estimated via a guided residual search and subsequently refined using multiple-shooting optimization. Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box methods and improved convergence compared to naive initialization."}

Submitted to IEEE Special Issue on \"Digital Twins for Wireless Networks: Enabling Application-Aware and Closed-Loop Optimization\"", "summary": "Beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems should take interference mitigation into account. However, for beamform design, accurate channel state information (CSI) is needed, which is often difficult to obtain due to channel variability, feedback overhead, or hardware constraints. For example, amplify-and-forward (AF) relays passively forward signals without measurement, precluding full CSI acquisition to and from the relay. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel prediction-assisted optimization (PAO) framework for beamform design in AF relay-assisted multiuser MIMO systems. The proposed solution in the AF relay aims at maximizing the signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratio (SINR). Unlike other methods, PAO relies solely on received power measurements, making it suitable for scenarios where CSI is unreliable or unavailable. PAO consists of two stages: a supervised-learning-based neural network (NN) that predicts the positions of transmitters using signal observations, and an optimization algorithm, guided by a digital twin (DT), that iteratively refines the beam direction of the relay in a simulated radio environment. As a key contribution, we validate the proposed framework using realistic measurements collected on a custom-built experimental millimeter wave (mmWave) platform, which enables training of the NN model under practical wireless conditions. The estimated information is then used to update the digital twin with knowledge of the surrounding environment, enabling online optimization. Numerical results show the trade-off between localization accuracy and beamforming performance and confirm that PAO maintains robustness even in the presence of localization errors while reducing the need for real-world measurements."}

One open problem that remains to be solved by a new generation of hearing aids is the cocktail party problem. A possible solution is electroencephalography-based auditory attention decoding. This has been the subject of several studies in recent years, which have in common that they use the same preprocessing methods in most cases. In this work, in order to achieve an advantage, the use of a scattering transform is proposed as an alternative to these preprocessing methods. The two-layer scattering transform is compared with a regular filterbank, the synchrosqueezing short-time Fourier transform and the common preprocessing. To demonstrate the performance, the known and the proposed preprocessing methods are compared for different classification tasks on two widely used datasets, provided by the KU Leuven (KUL) and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Both established and new neural-network-based models, CNNs, LSTMs, and recent Transformer/graph-based models are used for classification. Various evaluation strategies were compared, with a focus on the task of classifying speakers who are unknown from the training. We show that the two-layer scattering transform can significantly improve the performance for subject-related conditions, especially on the KUL dataset. However, on the DTU dataset, this only applies to some of the models, or when larger amounts of training data are provided, as in 10-fold cross-validation. This suggests that the scattering transform is capable of extracting additional relevant information."}

Time-Interleaving allows coping with complexity vs. speed by replacing the original architecture by M parallel paths. These path are clocked at a frequency M times smaller and their digital outputs time multiplexed. This is then converted to analog by means of a Digital to Analog Converter clocked at the high rate. This preprint proposes that time multiplexing be performed in the analog domain. As a result robustness against dynamic effects is achieved."}
