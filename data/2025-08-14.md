### [1] [RadioMamba: Breaking the Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off in Radio Map Construction via a Hybrid Mamba-UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09140)
*Honggang Jia,Nan Cheng,Xiucheng Wang,Conghao Zhou,Ruijin Sun,Xuemin,Shen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: RadioMamba是一种混合Mamba-UNet架构，用于解决无线电地图构建中的精度与效率权衡问题，通过结合全局依赖建模和局部特征提取，实现了更高的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的无线电地图构建方法存在精度与效率的权衡问题，无法同时满足实时性和准确性需求。

Method: 提出RadioMamba，采用Mamba-卷积块，Mamba分支以线性复杂度捕获全局依赖，卷积分支提取局部特征，结合全局与局部信息。

Result: 实验表明，RadioMamba比现有方法（包括扩散模型）精度更高，速度快20倍，参数仅占2.9%。

Conclusion: RadioMamba通过提升精度和效率，为下一代无线系统的实时智能优化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Radio map (RM) has recently attracted much attention since it can provide
real-time and accurate spatial channel information for 6G services and
applications. However, current deep learning-based methods for RM construction
exhibit well known accuracy-efficiency trade-off. In this paper, we introduce
RadioMamba, a hybrid Mamba-UNet architecture for RM construction to address the
trade-off. Generally, accurate RM construction requires modeling long-range
spatial dependencies, reflecting the global nature of wave propagation physics.
RadioMamba utilizes a Mamba-Convolutional block where the Mamba branch captures
these global dependencies with linear complexity, while a parallel
convolutional branch extracts local features. This hybrid design generates
feature representations that capture both global context and local detail.
Experiments show that RadioMamba achieves higher accuracy than existing
methods, including diffusion models, while operating nearly 20 times faster and
using only 2.9\% of the model parameters. By improving both accuracy and
efficiency, RadioMamba presents a viable approach for real-time intelligent
optimization in next generation wireless systems.

*Wenlihan Lu,Shijian Gao,Miaowen Wen,Yuxuan Liang,Chan-Byoung Chae,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于不确定性感知的无线电地图重建框架（URAM），结合贝叶斯神经网络和注意力强化学习，优化无人机导航的覆盖范围和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济兴起，无线电地图对无人机无线连接至关重要，但传统导航方式受限于电池容量，覆盖和效率不足。

Method: URAM框架结合贝叶斯神经网络实时估计空间不确定性，以及注意力强化学习策略进行全局路径规划，优化能量和信息获取。

Result: 实验显示，URAM比现有基线方法重建精度提升高达34%。

Conclusion: URAM通过智能路径规划显著提升了无人机导航的效率和准确性，为低空经济应用提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become
essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms.
Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using
waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity
significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose
an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly
leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach
integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that
estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based
reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a
probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and
energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent,
non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative
regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that
URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.

### [3] [Generative AI-Enabled Robust 6G Uplink: Principles, Challenges, and Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09348)
*Chunmei Xu,Yi Ma,Rahim Tafazolli,Peiying Zhu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: GenCom是一种利用生成式AI解决6G上行链路瓶颈的新范式，通过简化发射端设计并利用接收端的强大AI模型重构信号，提升语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络上行链路面临设备资源限制和信道条件挑战，需要创新解决方案。

Method: GenCom采用生成式AI模型在接收端重构信号，简化发射端的源和信道编码设计。

Result: GenCom在低信噪比条件下表现优于传统系统。

Conclusion: GenCom为未来人本、智能和可持续无线网络提供了潜在解决方案，但仍需解决实际挑战。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks (6G) face a critical uplink bottleneck due
to stringent device-side resource constraints and challenging channel
conditions. This article introduces GenCom, a novel system-level paradigm for
robust 6G uplink that leverages Generative AI and exploits the inherent
resource imbalance between transmitters and receivers. In GenCom, resource-rich
receivers deploy powerful offline-trained GenAI models to reconstruct high
semantic-fidelity content from degraded signals, while resource-constrained
transmitters are simplified in both source and channel coding design. We
present the core mechanisms and key design principles behind GenCom, which
shifts from conventional approaches toward simple semantic-preserving
compression, weak error-distribution codes, and semantic-aware retransmissions.
Through a case study, GenCom is shown to deliver robust performance across a
wide range of low and uncertain SNR/SINR conditions where conventional systems
fail. Finally, we outline critical challenges and research directions toward
making GenCom a practical enabler of future human-centric, intelligent, and
sustainable wireless networks.

### [4] [Satellites are closer than you think: A near field MIMO approach for Ground stations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09374)
*Rohith Reddy Vennam,Luke Wilson,Ish Kumar Jain,Dinesh Bharadia*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ArrayLink是一种分布式相控阵架构，通过组合多个小型商用面板实现高增益波束成形，提升LEO卫星地面站的回传容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面站基础设施扩展滞后于LEO卫星星座的增长，导致卫星到地面回传容量成为瓶颈。传统抛物面天线不适合密集、快速移动的LEO网络。

Method: 采用分布式相控阵架构，将16个（32x32）面板分布在千米级孔径上，实现高增益波束成形和空间复用。

Result: ArrayLink在增益、多流支持和距离范围上表现优异，接近传统抛物面天线性能，并支持多流传输。

Conclusion: ArrayLink为提升LEO回传容量提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has
revolutionized broadband access, earth observation, and direct-to-device
connectivity. However, the expansion of ground station infrastructure has not
kept pace, creating a critical bottleneck in satellite-to-ground backhaul
capacity. Traditional parabolic dish antennas, though effective for
geostationary (GEO) satellites, are ill-suited for dense, fastmoving LEO
networks due to mechanical steering delays and their inability to track
multiple satellites simultaneously. Phased array antennas offer electronically
steerable beams and multisatellite support, but their integration into ground
stations is limited by the high cost, hardware issues, and complexity of
achieving sufficient antenna gain. We introduce ArrayLink, a distributed phased
array architecture that coherently combines multiple small commercially
available panels to achieve high-gain beamforming and unlock line-of-sight MIMO
spatial multiplexing with minimal additional capital expenditure. By spacing 16
(32x32) panels across a kilometer-scale aperture, ArrayLink enters the
radiative near-field, focusing energy in both angle and range while supporting
up to four simultaneous spatial streams on a single feeder link. Through
rigorous theoretical analysis, detailed 2D beam pattern simulations and
real-world hardware experiments, we show that ArrayLink (i) achieves dish-class
gain with in range 1-2 dB of 1.47 m reflector, (ii) maintains four parallel
streams at ranges of hundreds of kilometers (falling to two beyond 2000 km),
and (iii) exhibits tight agreement across theory, simulation, and experiment
with minimal variance. These findings open a practical and scalable path to
boosting LEO backhaul capacity.

### [5] [Sub-THz Power Amplifiers: Measurements, Behavioral Modeling and Predistortion Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09545)
*Lutfi Samara,Simon Haussmann,Erind Tufa,Antonio Alberto D'Amico,Tommaso Zugno,Ingmar Kallfass,Thomas Kürner*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了太赫兹（THz）频段中功率放大器（PA）的非线性问题，提出了AM-AM和AM-PM模型，并设计了一种预失真算法以改善系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球IMT流量预计在2020至2030年间增长10-100倍，THz频段成为满足需求的有力候选。然而，THz收发器中的宽带射频组件非线性问题（尤其是PA）会严重影响系统性能。

Method: 通过小信号和大信号连续波测量，对300 GHz PA进行表征，并开发了AM-AM和AM-PM模型。基于模型设计了预失真算法，并分析了其性能。

Result: 模型验证了压缩行为，但在低输入功率时存在不准确性。预失真算法在多载波波形切换时性能下降，但通过参数优化可显著改善性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过模型优化和预失真算法参数选择，可以有效提升THz频段PA的性能。

Abstract: With global IMT traffic expected to grow 10-100 times from 2020 to 20301, the
Terahertz (THz) spectrum offers a promising solution to satisfy such forecasts.
However, occupying the THz spectrum comes with its own challenges, an important
one being impairments caused by broadband RF components in THz transceivers.
Nonlinearities in power amplifiers (PAs) complicate meeting link budget
requirements, with amplitude and phase distortions degrading the system's
performance, especially when adopting waveforms with high peak-to-average power
ratios (PAPRs), such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). In
this paper, we present characterization results of a 300 GHz PA using
small-signal and large-signal continuous-wave measurements. Models capturing
Amplitude-to- Amplitude Modulation (AM-AM) and Amplitude-to-Phase Modulation
(AMPM) behavior across 270-330 GHz are developed and verified with wideband
measurements, confirming the compression behavior, while nonetheless showing
inaccuracies for low input powers due to unaccounted frequency dependencies.
Based on the derived models, a predistortion algorithm is designed and
analyzed, revealing significant error performance degradation when switching
between single- and multi-carrier waveforms. We finally show that an
appropriate selection of pre-distorter parameters can significantly improve the
performance.

Method: 设计了一种基于消息传递的定位方法和架构，适用于面板式分布式MIMO系统，无需集中处理，联合检测动态场景中的多路径测量。

Result: 该方法在定位性能上与多路径定位方法相当，但延迟和计算复杂度更低，并通过FPGA实现验证了系统延迟模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为分布式MIMO系统提供了一种高效、低延迟的定位解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Distributed MIMO and integrated sensing and communication are expected to be
key technologies in future wireless systems, enabling reliable, low-latency
communication and accurate localization. Dedicated localization solutions must
support distributed architecture, provide scalability across different system
configurations and meet strict latency requirements. We present a scalable
message-passing localization method and architecture co-designed for a
panel-based distributed MIMO system and network topology, in which
interconnected units operate without centralized processing. This method
jointly detects line-of-sight paths to distributed units from multipath
measurements in dynamic scenarios, localizes the agent, and achieves very low
latency. Additionally, we introduce a cycle-accurate system latency model based
on implemented FPGA operations, and show important insights into processing
latency and hardware utilization and system-level trade-offs. We compare our
method to a multipath-based localization method and show that it can achieve
similar localization performance, with wide enough distribution of array
elements, while offering lower latency and computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以在不干扰系统的情况下准确测量操作符成本，尤其是在高速数据平面中。

Method: 采用饱和吞吐量增量方法，捕捉非线性扩展行为，并引入操作符性能象限（OPQ）框架对操作符进行分类。

Result: 发现计算密集型操作符（如CRC）表现出超线性行为，而大多数其他操作符为次线性。此外，揭示了Arm和x86架构间的象限偏移。

Conclusion: 该方法为性能建模和优化提供了准确、架构感知的瓶颈诊断和现实基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes a saturation throughput delta-based methodology to
precisely measure operator costs in high-speed data planes without intrusive
instrumentation. The approach captures non-linear scaling, revealing that
compute-intensive operators like CRC exhibit super-linear behavior, while most
others are sub-linear. We introduce the Operator Performance Quadrant (OPQ)
framework to classify operators by base and scaling costs, exposing a
cross-architecture Quadrant Shift between Arm and x86. This method provides
accurate, architecture-aware bottleneck diagnosis and a realistic basis for
performance modeling and optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编队行驶是V2X应用中极具前景的技术，可提升道路安全、交通效率和环境可持续性，但其对无线通信的高可靠性和低延迟要求提出了挑战。

Method: 采用分布式和调度资源分配方案（Mode 2d），车辆组可从配置的资源池中自主选择资源，无需网络辅助。通过仿真评估其性能。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方案能够满足编队行驶对可靠性、低延迟和数据率的需求。

Conclusion: 组调度方案（Mode 2d）是一种有效的资源分配方法，适用于编队行驶的高要求通信场景。

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a key technology for enabling
intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that can improve road safety, traffic
efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Among the various V2X
applications, platooning is one of the most promising ones, as it allows a
group of vehicles to travel closely together at high speeds, reducing fuel
consumption and emissions. However, it poses significant challenges for
wireless communication, such as high reliability and low latency. In this
paper, we evaluate the benefits of group scheduling, also referred to as Mode
2d, which is based on a distributed and scheduled resource allocation scheme
that allows the group of cars to select resources from a configured pool
without network assistance. We evaluated the scheme through simulations, and
the results show that this approach can meet the reliability, low latency, and
data rate requirements for platooning.

### [9] [CKFNet: Neural Network Aided Cubature Kalman filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09727)
*Jinhui Hu,Haiquan Zhao,Yi Peng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: CKFNet结合RNN与CKF框架，通过动态适应未建模不确定性提升性能，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CKF因模型与环境不匹配导致的性能下降问题。

Result: 实验表明CKFNet在准确性和鲁棒性上优于传统方法和KalmanNet。

Conclusion: CKFNet通过结合RNN与CKF，有效提升了非线性估计的性能。

Abstract: The cubature Kalman filter (CKF), while theoretically rigorous for nonlinear
estimation, often suffers performance degradation due to model-environment
mismatches in practice. To address this limitation, we propose CKFNet-a hybrid
architecture that synergistically integrates recurrent neural networks (RNN)
with the CKF framework while preserving its cubature principles. Unlike
conventional model-driven approaches, CKFNet embeds RNN modules in the
prediction phase to dynamically adapt to unmodeled uncertainties, effectively
reducing cumulative error propagation through temporal noise correlation
learning. Crucially, the architecture maintains CKF's analytical
interpretability via constrained optimization of cubature point distributions.
Numerical simulation experiments have confirmed that our proposed CKFNet
exhibits superior accuracy and robustness compared to conventional model-based
methods and existing KalmanNet algorithms.

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法能有效适应动态信道条件，显著降低信道估计误差。

Conclusion: 该方法为标准兼容且高效的自适应信道去噪提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Channel denoising is a practical and effective technique for mitigating
channel estimation errors in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. However, adapting
denoising techniques to varying channel conditions typically requires prior
knowledge or incurs significant training overhead. To address these challenges,
we propose a standard-compatible strategy for generating online training data
that enables online adaptive channel denoising. The key idea is to leverage
high-quality channel estimates obtained via data-aided channel estimation as
practical substitutes for unavailable ground-truth channels. Our data-aided
method exploits adjacent detected data symbols within a specific time-frequency
neighborhood as virtual reference signals, and we analytically derive the
optimal size of this neighborhood to minimize the mean squared error of the
resulting estimates. By leveraging the proposed strategy, we devise two channel
denoising approaches, one based on transfer learning, which fine-tunes a
pre-trained denoising neural network, and the other based on meta learning,
which rapidly adapts to new channel environments with minimal updates.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively adapt to
dynamic channel conditions and significantly reduce channel estimation errors
compared to conventional techniques.

### [11] [Location Privacy-Enabled Beamforming in ISAC Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09882)
*Umair Ali Khan,Lester Ho,Holger Claussen,Chinmoy Kundu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于方向到达混淆比（DAOR）的波束成形框架，用于保护ISAC场景中的发射机位置隐私，同时优化通信速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC技术虽然实现了环境感知和数据传输，但会暴露用户位置，因此需要一种保护隐私的方法。

Method: 通过广义特征值分析推导DAOR的闭式边界，并在DAOR约束下提出速率最大化问题，采用半定松弛、特征模式选择和最优功率分配求解。

Result: 提出的DAOR波束成形在保护隐私的同时实现了通信速率的权衡，次优设计在10 dB SNR下计算时间减少85%。

Conclusion: DAOR框架有效平衡了隐私保护和通信性能，次优设计在计算效率上表现优异。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology enables simultaneous
environmental perception and data transmission in wireless networks; however,
it also exposes user location to receivers. In this paper, we introduce a novel
beamforming framework guided by the proposed privacy metric direction of
arrival obfuscation ratio (DAOR) to protect transmitter location privacy in
ISAC scenarios. Unlike previous approaches, we do not suppress the
line-of-sight (LOS) component while reshaping the angular power distribution so
that a false direction appears dominant at the receiver. We derive closed-form
bounds on the feasible DAOR via generalized eigenvalue analysis and formulate
an achievable rate-maximization problem under the DAOR constraint. The
resulting problem is non-convex, which is efficiently solved using semidefinite
relaxation, eigenmode selection, and optimal power allocation. A suboptimal
design strategy is also proposed with reduced complexity. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed DAOR-based beamformer achieves a trade-off
between location privacy and communication rate without nullifying the LOS
path. Results also show that a suboptimal design achieves a near-optimal
communication rate with nearly an 85% reduction in computation time at a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB.

### [12] [Beam Cross Sections Create Mixtures: Improving Feature Localization in Secondary Electron Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09942)
*Vaibhav Choudhary,Akshay Agarwal,Vivek K Goyal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的二次电子成像技术，通过混合分布模型和最大似然估计（MLE）显著提高了边缘定位的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积模型仅描述二次电子计数的均值，无法完全捕捉其分布特性，限制了分辨率。

Method: 采用混合分布模型描述二次电子计数，并利用时间分辨测量（TRM）和最大似然估计（MLE）优化边缘定位。

Result: 模拟实验显示MLE将边缘定位的均方根误差（RMSE）降低了5倍，实际HIM数据中平均降低5.4倍。

Conclusion: 混合分布模型和MLE显著提升了二次电子成像的分辨率，尤其在边缘定位任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron
microscopy and helium ion microscopy (HIM), use electrons emitted by a sample
in response to a focused beam of charged particles incident at a grid of raster
scan positions. Spot size -- the diameter of the incident beam's spatial
profile -- is one of the limiting factors for resolution, along with various
sources of noise in the SE signal. The effect of the beam spatial profile is
commonly understood as convolutional. We show that under a simple and plausible
physical abstraction for the beam, though convolution describes the mean of the
SE counts, the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture. We demonstrate that
this more detailed modeling can enable resolution improvements over
conventional estimators through a stylized application in semiconductor
inspection of localizing the edge in a two-valued sample. We derive Fisher
information about edge location in conventional and time-resolved measurements
(TRM) and also derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the latter.
Empirically, the MLE computed from TRM is approximately efficient except at
very low beam diameter, so Fisher information comparisons are predictive of
performance and can be used to optimize the beam diameter relative to the
raster scan spacing. Monte Carlo simulations show that the MLE gives a 5-fold
reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization as compared to
conventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to three real HIM
datasets, the average RMSE reduction factor is 5.4.

### [13] [Deviation Inequalities for Rényi Divergence Estimators via Variational Expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09382)
*Sreejith Sreekumar,Kengo Kato*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文针对Rényi散度的估计误差提出了指数偏差不等式，适用于平滑插件估计器和神经网络估计器，无需传统假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献对Rényi散度估计误差的概率界限研究不足，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将误差与适当的经验过程关联，并利用经验过程理论工具，建立指数偏差不等式。

Result: 提出了适用于非紧支撑或无密度下界的分布的偏差不等式，并推导了一侧浓度界限。

Conclusion: 该方法在信息论和隐私审计中有潜在应用，如随机编码和Rényi差分隐私测试。

Abstract: R\'enyi divergences play a pivotal role in information theory, statistics,
and machine learning. While several estimators of these divergences have been
proposed in the literature with their consistency properties established and
minimax convergence rates quantified, existing accounts of probabilistic bounds
governing the estimation error are premature. Here, we make progress in this
regard by establishing exponential deviation inequalities for smoothed plug-in
estimators and neural estimators by relating the error to an appropriate
empirical process and leveraging tools from empirical process theory. In
particular, our approach does not require the underlying distributions to be
compactly supported or have densities bounded away from zero, an assumption
prevalent in existing results. The deviation inequality also leads to a
one-sided concentration bound from the expectation, which is useful in
random-coding arguments over continuous alphabets in information theory with
potential applications to physical-layer security. As another concrete
application, we consider a hypothesis testing framework for auditing R\'{e}nyi
differential privacy using the neural estimator as a test statistic and obtain
non-asymptotic performance guarantees for such a test.

Abstract: Self-dual maximum distance separable (MDS) codes over finite fields are
linear codes with significant combinatorial and cryptographic applications.
Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes can be both MDS and self-dual. In
this paper, we study a general class of TGRS codes (A-TGRS), which encompasses
all previously known special cases. First, we establish a sufficient and
necessary condition for an A-TGRS code to be Hermitian self-dual. Furthermore,
we present four constructions of self-dual TGRS codes, which, to the best of
our knowledge, nearly cover all the related results previously reported in the
literature. More importantly, we also obtain several new classes of Hermitian
self-dual TGRS codes with flexible parameters. Based on this framework, we
derive a sufficient and necessary condition for an A-TGRS code to be Hermitian
self-dual and MDS. In addition, we construct a class of MDS Hermitian self-dual
TGRS code by appropriately selecting the evaluation points. This work
investigates the Hermitian self-duality of TGRS codes from the perspective of
matrix representation, leading to more concise and transparent analysis. More
generally, the Euclidean self-dual TGRS codes and the Hermitian self-dual GRS
codes can also be understood easily from this point.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型可重构流体智能表面（FRIS）框架，其流体单元能根据瞬时信道条件动态调整辐射模式。通过理论分析和仿真验证，该框架在点对点和多用户通信场景中均显著优于传统RIS架构。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pattern-reconfigurable fluid reconfigurable
intelligent surface (FRIS) framework, where each fluid element can dynamically
adjust its radiation pattern based on instantaneous channel conditions. To
evaluate its potential, we first conduct a comparative analysis of the received
signal power in point-to-point communication systems assisted by three types of
surfaces: (1) the proposed pattern-reconfigurable FRIS, (2) a
position-reconfigurable FRIS, and (3) a conventional RIS. Theoretical results
demonstrate that the pattern-reconfigurable FRIS provides a significant
advantage in modulating transmission signals compared to the other two
configurations. To further study its capabilities, we extend the framework to a
multiuser communication scenario. In this context, the spherical harmonics
orthogonal decomposition (SHOD) method is employed to accurately model the
radiation patterns of individual fluid elements, making the pattern design
process more tractable. An optimization problem is then formulated with the
objective of maximizing the weighted sum rate among users by jointly designing
the active beamforming vectors and the spherical harmonics coefficients,
subject to both transmit power and pattern energy constraints. To tackle the
resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm
that alternates between a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) approach for active
beamforming and a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method for updating the
spherical harmonics coefficients. Simulation results show that the proposed
pattern-reconfigurable FRIS significantly outperforms traditional RIS
architectures based on the 3GPP 38.901 and isotropic radiation models,
achieving average performance gains of 161.5% and 176.2%, respectively.

Conclusion: ORCAS码在性能和灵活性上优于极化码，适用于低复杂度解码需求。

Abstract: Motivated by the need for channel codes with low-complexity soft-decision
decoding algorithms, we consider the recursive Plotkin concatenation of optimal
low-rate and high-rate codes based on simplex codes and their duals. These
component codes come with low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoding
which, in turn, enables efficient successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding.
As a result, the proposed optimally recursively concatenated simplex (ORCAS)
codes achieve a performance that is at least as good as that of polar codes.
For practical parameters, the proposed construction significantly outperforms
polar codes in terms of block error rate by up to 0.5 dB while maintaining
similar decoding complexity. Furthermore, the codes offer greater flexibility
in codeword length than conventional polar codes.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-orthogonal affine frequency division
multiplexing {(nAFDM)} waveform for reliable high-mobility communications with
enhanced spectral efficiency {(SE)}. The key idea is {to introduce} a bandwidth
compression factor into the AFDM {modulator} to enable controllable subcarrier
overlapping. We first {detail the proposed nAFDM transceiver} and derive the
corresponding input-output {signal} relationship. Then, an efficient {nAFDM}
signal generation method based on the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT)
is proposed, enabling practical implementation using existing inverse fast
Fourier transform (IFFT) modules without additional hardware complexity. Next,
to characterize the impact of non-orthogonal modulation, we derive a
closed-form expression {of} inter-carrier interference (ICI), showing its
dependence on the bandwidth compression factor. To mitigate the resulting
interference, we propose a soft iterative detection algorithm and a
low-complexity implementation approach that leverages the distribution
characteristics of ICI. {Simulation results demonstrate that 1) in terms of bit
error rate (BER), the proposed nAFDM can achieve near identical BER compared to
conventional AFDM, while outperforms other waveform counterparts; 2) nAFDM is
capable of striking higher SE compared to other existing waveforms; and 3) the
proposed nAFDM achieves an attractive BER vs. SE trade-off, and the proposed
soft ID scheme can attain a trade-off between BER and complexity.}

Abstract: With the explosive growth of maritime activities, it is expected to provide
seamless communications with quality of service (QoS) guarantee over broad sea
area. In the context, this paper proposes a space-air-ground-sea integrated
maritime communication architecture combining satellite, unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV), terrestrial base station (TBS) and unmanned surface vessel

space is divided to coastal area, offshore area, middle-sea area and open-sea
area, the maritime users in which are served by TBS, USV, UAV and satellite,
respectively. Then, by exploiting the potential of integrated maritime
communication system, a joint beamforming and trajectory optimization algorithm
is designed to maximize the minimum transmission rate of maritime users.
Finally, theoretical analysis and simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed algorithm.
