### [1] [Construction of $(n,n)$-functions with low differential-linear uniformity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01190)
*Xi Xie,Nian Li,Qiang Wang,Xiangyong Zeng,Yinglong Du*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了$(n,n)$-函数的差分-线性性质，提出了两类具有低差分-线性均匀性（DLU）的幂函数，并通过结合已知DLU的幂函数构造了多类低DLU的$(n,n)$-函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分-线性连接表（DLCT）是分析差分-线性攻击中两个子密码依赖关系的新工具，本文旨在探索$(n,n)$-函数的差分-线性性质。

Method: 通过改进特定指数和，提出两类低DLU的幂函数；利用已知DLU的幂函数，结合立方函数和二次函数，以及广义分圆映射，构造低DLU的$(n,n)$-函数。

Result: 构造了多类低DLU的$(n,n)$-函数，部分达到或接近现有最优结果。

Conclusion: 本文为$(n,n)$-函数的差分-线性性质研究提供了新工具和构造方法，扩展了低DLU函数的类别。

Abstract: The differential-linear connectivity table (DLCT), introduced by Bar-On et
al. at EUROCRYPT'19, is a novel tool that captures the dependency between the
two subciphers involved in differential-linear attacks. This paper is devoted
to exploring the differential-linear properties of $(n,n)$-functions. First, by
refining specific exponential sums, we propose two classes of power functions
over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ with low differential-linear uniformity (DLU). Next, we
further investigate the differential-linear properties of $(n,n)$-functions
that are polynomials by utilizing power functions with known DLU. Specifically,
by combining a cubic function with quadratic functions, and employing
generalized cyclotomic mappings, we construct several classes of
$(n,n)$-functions with low DLU, including some that achieve optimal or
near-optimal DLU compared to existing results.

Conclusion: 论文为近场通信中的天线布局优化提供了理论框架和实用方法，揭示了边缘天线密度对速率提升的关键作用。

Abstract: The advent of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has
provided new opportunities for capacity improvement via strategic antenna
deployment, especially when the near-field effect is pronounced due to antenna
proliferation. In this paper, we investigate the optimal antenna placement for
maximizing the achievable rate of a point-to-point near-field channel, where
the transmitter is deployed with massive movable antennas. First, we propose a
novel design framework to explore the relationship between antenna positions
and achievable data rate. By introducing the continuous antenna position
function (APF) and antenna density function (ADF), we reformulate the antenna
position design problem from the discrete to the continuous domain, which
maximizes the achievable rate functional with respect to ADF. Leveraging
functional analysis and variational methods, we derive the optimal ADF
condition and propose a gradient-based algorithm for numerical solutions under
general channel conditions. Furthermore, for the near-field line-of-sight (LoS)
scenario, we present a closed-form solution for the optimal ADF, revealing the
critical role of edge antenna density in enhancing the achievable rate.
Finally, we propose a flexible antenna array-based deployment method that
ensures practical implementation while mitigating mutual coupling issues.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework,
with uniform circular arrays emerging as a promising geometry for balancing
performance and deployment feasibility in near-field communications.

### [3] [Towed Movable Antenna (ToMA) Array for Ultra Secure Airborne Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01229)
*Lipeng Zhu,Haobin Mao,Wenyan Ma,Zhenyu Xiao,Jun Zhang,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型拖曳式可移动天线（ToMA）阵列架构，用于增强机载通信系统的物理层安全性，通过动态几何重构和零波束成形技术提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定位置天线（FPA）阵列在机载通信中灵活性不足，难以应对复杂的窃听威胁，因此需要一种更灵活的天线阵列设计。

Method: 采用拖曳式可移动天线阵列，通过优化天线位置向量（APV）和零波束成形技术，最大化合法用户的遍历可达速率。

Result: 仿真结果显示，ToMA阵列在窃听者靠近用户且信道为视距主导的场景中，性能显著优于传统FPA阵列。

Conclusion: ToMA阵列通过动态几何重构和优化的天线位置，显著提升了机载通信系统的安全性和性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel towed movable antenna (ToMA) array architecture
to enhance the physical layer security of airborne communication systems.
Unlike conventional onboard arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the
ToMA array employs multiple subarrays mounted on flexible cables and towed by
distributed drones, enabling agile deployment in three-dimensional (3D) space
surrounding the central aircraft. This design significantly enlarges the
effective array aperture and allows dynamic geometry reconfiguration, offering
superior spatial resolution and beamforming flexibility. We consider a secure
transmission scenario where an airborne transmitter communicates with multiple
legitimate users in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. To ensure
security, zero-forcing beamforming is employed to nullify signal leakage toward
eavesdroppers. Based on the statistical distributions of locations of users and
eavesdroppers, the antenna position vector (APV) of the ToMA array is optimized
to maximize the users' ergodic achievable rate. Analytical results for the case
of a single user and a single eavesdropper reveal the optimal APV structure
that minimizes their channel correlation. For the general multiuser scenario,
we develop a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm by leveraging
Riemannian manifold optimization. Simulation results confirm that the proposed
ToMA array achieves significant performance gains over conventional onboard FPA
arrays, especially in scenarios where eavesdroppers are closely located to
users under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant channels.

### [4] [New constant-dimension subspace codes from parallel cosets of optimal Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes and multilevel inserting constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01258)
*Gang Wang,Hong-Yang Yao,Fang-Wei Fu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的恒定维度子空间码（CDC）构造方法，通过结合并行陪集和多级构造，建立了65个新的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恒定维度子空间码在网络编码中有重要应用，研究其最大码字数量是一个基本问题。

Method: 提出并行陪集构造和多级构造方法，结合新的标识向量集和最优FDRMCs。

Result: 构造了三类大型CDC，其中一类使用了新的最优FDRMCs，并建立了65个新的下界。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了CDC的码字数量，为网络编码提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Constant-dimension subspace codes (CDCs), a special class of subspace codes,
have attracted significant attention due to their applications in network
coding. A fundamental research problem of CDCs is to determine the maximum
number of codewords under the given parameters. The paper first proposes the
construction of parallel cosets of optimal Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes
(FDRMCs) by employing the list of CDCs and inverse list of CDCs. Then a new
class of CDCs is obtained by combining the parallel cosets of optimal FDRMCs
with parallel linkage construction. Next, we present a novel set of identifying
vectors and provide a new construction of CDCs via the multilevel constuction.
Finally, the coset construction is inserted into the multilevel construction
and three classes of large CDCs are provided, one of which is constructed by
using new optimal FDRMCs. Our results establish at least 65 new lower bounds
for CDCs with larger sizes than the previously best known codes.

### [5] [Information Rates of Approximate Message Passing for Bandlimited Direct-Detection Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01438)
*Daniel Plabst,Mohamed Akrout,Amine Mezghani,Gerhard Kramer*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义向量近似消息传递（GVAMP）检测器，用于提高带限直接检测信道的速率，并通过多级编码和连续干扰消除实现性能提升。该方法在光纤信道中表现优异，显著缩小了与理论容量的差距，并提高了功率效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接检测信道的容量因接收器非线性而难以计算或逼近，因此需要一种高效且复杂度合理的方法来提升速率。

Method: 设计了GVAMP检测器，结合多级编码和连续干扰消除技术，应用于具有长符号间干扰的光纤信道。

Result: 双极性调制在光放大链路中接近理论容量0.3 bpcu，功率效率比单极性调制高6 dB，检测器对信道参数变化具有鲁棒性。GVAMP复杂度显著低于现有神经网络。

Conclusion: GVAMP检测器在性能和复杂度之间取得了良好平衡，适用于实际光纤通信系统。

Abstract: The capacity of bandlimited direct-detection channels is difficult to compute
or approach because of the receiver nonlinearity. A generalized vector
approximate message passing (GVAMP) detector is designed to achieve high rates
with reasonable complexity. The rates increase by using multi-level coding and
successive interference cancellation. The methods are applied to optical fiber
channels with long intersymbol interference, as encountered in practice.
Bipolar modulation operates within 0.3 bits per channel use (bpcu) of the
real-alphabet coherent capacity for optically-amplified links, improving the
best existing gap of 1 bpcu based on theory. Remarkably, bipolar modulation
gains 6 decibels (dB) in power efficiency over unipolar modulation, and 3 dB
for unamplified links. The detector is robust to changes in channel parameters
such as the fiber length. The GVAMP complexity, measured in multiplications per
information bit (mpib), is proportional to the number of iterations and the
logarithm of the block length, and is substantially less than state-of-the-art
neural networks. The receiver requires approximately 38 iterations to achieve a
rate of 5 bpcu with 80 mpib.

### [6] [Explicit Function-Correcting Code Constructions for Lee Metric Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01702)
*Hareesh K.,Rashid Ummer N. T.,B. Sundar Rajan*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的Plotkin-like边界，用于不规则Lee距离码，并构建了针对特定函数类的显式函数校正Lee码（FCLC），证明了其冗余度的优化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究函数校正码（FCCs）以保护函数评估免受错误影响，同时最小化冗余度。

Method: 提出改进的Plotkin-like边界，构建显式FCLCs，并分析其冗余度。

Result: FCLCs在特定函数类中表现最优，且相比传统Lee纠错码能显著减少冗余度。

Conclusion: FCLCs在保持函数正确性的同时，能有效降低冗余度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Function-Correcting Codes (FCCs) are a novel class of codes designed to
protect function evaluations of messages against errors while minimizing
redundancy. A theoretical framework for systematic FCCs to channels matched to
the Lee metric has been studied recently, which introduced function-correcting
Lee codes (FCLCs) and also derived upper and lower bounds on their optimal
redundancy. In this paper, we propose a Plotkin-like bound for irregular
Lee-distance codes, which improves an existing bound. We construct explicit
FCLCs for specific classes of functions, including the Lee weight, Lee weight
distribution, modular sum, and locally bounded function. For these functions,
lower bounds on redundancy are obtained, and our constructions are shown to be
optimal in certain cases. Finally, a comparative analysis with classical Lee
error-correcting codes and codes correcting errors in function values
demonstrates that FCLCs can significantly reduce redundancy while preserving
function correctness.

### [7] [Implementing Neural Networks Over-the-Air via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01840)
*Meng Hua,Chenghong Bian,Haotian Wu,Deniz Gunduz*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AirFC的新型计算范式，利用RIS辅助的MIMO OAC系统模拟神经网络的全连接层，并通过联合优化和训练策略实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过RIS和MIMO OAC系统模拟神经网络的全连接层，以优化无线传播环境并实现高效计算。

Method: 提出了一种低复杂度的交替优化算法，并研究了集中式和分布式两种训练策略。

Result: 仿真结果表明，RIS辅助的MIMO配置实现的AirFC系统能够达到满意的分类准确率。

Conclusion: AirFC系统通过RIS和MIMO OAC的结合，为模拟神经网络全连接层提供了一种高效且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) OAC systems designed to emulate the
fully-connected (FC) layer of a neural network (NN) via analog OAC, where the
RIS and the transceivers are jointly adjusted to engineer the ambient wireless
propagation environment to emulate the weights of the target FC layer. We refer
to this novel computational paradigm as AirFC. We first study the case in which
the precoder, combiner, and RIS phase shift matrices are jointly optimized to
minimize the mismatch between the OAC system and the target FC layer. To solve
this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity alternating
optimization algorithm, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all
optimization variables are derived. Next, we consider training of the system
parameters using two distinct learning strategies, namely centralized training
and distributed training. In the centralized training approach, training is
performed at either the transmitter or the receiver, whichever possesses the
channel state information (CSI), and the trained parameters are provided to the
other terminal. In the distributed training approach, the transmitter and
receiver iteratively update their parameters through back and forth
transmissions by leveraging channel reciprocity, thereby avoiding CSI
acquisition and significantly reducing computational complexity. Subsequently,
we extend our analysis to a multi-RIS scenario by exploiting its spatial
diversity gain to enhance the system performance. Simulation results show that
the AirFC system realized by the RIS-aided MIMO configuration achieves
satisfactory classification accuracy.

### [8] [Robust Detection of Planted Subgraphs in Semi-Random Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02158)
*Dor Elimelech,Wasim Huleihel*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 研究了在半随机模型下检测Erdős-Rényi随机图中植入子图的问题，揭示了统计极限的二分性，并提出了新的高效检测算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多基于纯随机生成模型，但实际应用中可能面临对抗性扰动，因此需要研究更具鲁棒性的半随机模型。

Method: 引入半随机模型，允许对手在植入子图外移除边，统计学家无法知晓移除的边。分析了统计极限，并设计了高效的检测算法。

Result: 发现植入子图的密度决定了检测的可行性：强次对数密度下检测不可能，而超对数密度下统计极限不变。新算法在计算效率和鲁棒性上表现优异。

Conclusion: 建立了首个植入子图检测的鲁棒框架，为半随机模型、计算-统计权衡及图推断问题的鲁棒性研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Detection of planted subgraphs in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs has been
extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both
statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a
purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially
fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the
study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein
an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the
graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains
unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to
the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection
under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for
planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection
becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary,
despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for
subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain
essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally
intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical
boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection
algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance. Our
results establish the first robust framework for planted subgraph detection and
open new directions in the study of semi-random models,
computational-statistical trade-offs, and robustness in graph inference
problems.

Conclusion: 研究为序列重构问题提供了理论支持，并揭示了染色配置与覆盖设计的关系。

Abstract: This paper studies the sequence reconstruction problem for a channel inspired
by protein identification. We introduce a coloring channel, where a sequence is
transmitted through a channel that deletes all symbols not belonging to a fixed
subset (the coloring) of the alphabet. By extending this to a coloring profile,
a tuple of distinct colorings, we analyze the channel's information rate and
capacity. We prove that optimal (i.e., achieving maximum information rate)
coloring profiles correspond to 2-covering designs and identify the minimal
covering number required for maximum information rate, as well as the minimum
number for which any coloring profile is optimal.

classified into two strategies: leveraging pre-trained LAMs and developing
native LAMs designed specifically for physical layer tasks. The motivations and
key frameworks of these approaches are comprehensively examined through
multiple use cases. Both strategies significantly improve performance and
adaptability across diverse wireless scenarios. Future research directions,
including efficient architectures, interpretability, standardized datasets, and

### [11] [Properties and Decoding of Twisted GRS Codes and Their Extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02382)
*Yang Li,Martianus Frederic Ezerman,Huimin Lao,San Ling*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了非广义Reed-Solomon（GRS）MDS码和近MDS（NMDS）码，特别是通过扭曲GRS（TGRS）构造的$(+)$-TGRS码及其扩展版本$(+)$-ETGRS码。解决了这些码是否为非GRS MDS码的问题，并改进了其解码算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非GRS MDS码和NMDS码在通信、密码学和存储系统中的实际应用，并填补现有理论中的空白。

Method: 通过分析$(+)$-TGRS码和$(+)$-ETGRS码的性质，确定其是否为非GRS MDS码，并提出改进的解码算法。

Result: 发现两类非GRS MDS Hermitian自对偶TGRS码，证明不存在Galois自对偶ETGRS码，并提出优于现有算法的ETGRS码解码方法。

Conclusion: 论文填补了非GRS MDS码和NMDS码的理论空白，并提供了实际应用中的改进解码算法。

Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that are not equivalent to generalized
Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are called non-GRS MDS codes. Alongside near MDS
(NMDS) codes, they are applicable in communication, cryptography, and storage
systems. From theoretical perspective, it is particularly intriguing to
investigate families of linear codes in which each element can be determined to
be either a non-GRS MDS or an NMDS code. Two promising candidates for such
families emerge from what is known as twisted GRS (TGRS) construction. These
candidates are the $(+)$-TGRS codes and their extended versions, called
$(+)$-extended TGRS (ETGRS) codes.
  Although many of their properties have been characterized, there are gaps to
fill. Which among the codes are non-GRS MDS? Can we improve on their decoding
by using their error-correcting pairs or deep holes? In this paper we solve
these problems. The answer to the first problem leads us to two classes of
non-GRS MDS Hermitian self-dual TGRS codes and a proof that there is no Galois
self-dual ETGRS code. Addressing the second problem, we present an explicit
decoding algorithm for ETGRS codes that outperforms existing decoding
algorithms given some conditions. By considering the duals of TGRS codes which
are MDS, we determine the covering radius and a class of deep holes of the
recently constructed non-GRS MDS codes due to Han and Zhang.

### [12] [CSI Obfuscation: Single-Antenna Transmitters Can Not Hide from Adversarial Multi-Antenna Radio Localization Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02553)
*Phillip Stephan,Florian Euchner,Stephan ten Brink*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对多天线接收器的CSI恢复方法，以应对单天线发射器通过随机序列混淆信号带来的隐私问题，并评估了其对定位性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电信系统能够通过无线电环境定位用户和物体，引发了隐私问题。单天线发射器通过随机序列混淆信号以防止未经授权的定位，但这种方法仅对单天线接收器有效。

Method: 受盲多通道识别启发，提出了一种简单的CSI恢复方法，用于多天线接收器提取信道特征，确保可靠的用户定位。

Result: 通过实际信道测量，评估了信号混淆和CSI恢复方法对CSI指纹、信道图表和经典三角定位的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，需要进一步努力保护用户的位置隐私，防止基于无线电的敌对定位系统的威胁。

Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects
in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent
unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal
by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters
the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this
strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying
single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel
identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna
receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization
regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of
signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization
performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical
triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to
demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy
of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.

and PIR codes of fixed dimension and for a fixed list size, over an arbitrary
finite field. We recover, generalize, and refine several results that were
previously obtained for binary codes. We present new upper and lower bounds for
the minimum length, and discuss the asymptotic behaviour of this parameter. We
also compute its value for several parameter sets. The paper also offers
insights into the "correct" list size to consider for the Functional Batch
Conjecture over non-binary finite fields, and establishes various supporting
results.

### [14] [RC-Gossip: Information Freshness in Clustered Networks with Rate-Changing Gossip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02657)
*Irtiza Hasan,Ahmed Arafa*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RC-Gossip的智能信息传播机制，通过动态调整传播速率，显著提升了集群网络中节点的信息新鲜度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究集群网络中节点如何保持信息新鲜度，传统方法效果有限，需要更高效的传播机制。

Method: 引入RC-Gossip机制，根据网络中新鲜节点的数量动态调整传播速率，并采用基于更新奖励的分析方法。

Result: RC-Gossip在不同集群网络中显著提升了节点信息新鲜度，且存在最优集群规模。

Conclusion: RC-Gossip是一种高效的信息传播机制，优于传统方法，适用于集群网络。

Abstract: A clustered gossip network is considered in which a source updates its
information over time, and end-nodes, organized in clusters through
clusterheads, are keeping track of it. The goal for the nodes is to remain as
fresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we
assess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart
mechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip
(RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that
need it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number
of fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System
(SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we
present an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based
approach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness
of nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared
to traditional gossiping techniques.

### [15] [Binary Hypothesis Testing-Based Low-Complexity Beamspace Channel Estimation for mmWave Massive MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01007)
*Hanyoung Park,Ji-Woong Choi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯二元假设检验和波束空间稀疏性的低复杂度信道去噪方法，适用于毫米波通信系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波通信因其高带宽潜力受到关注，但信号存在路径损耗大、散射差等问题，需大规模天线阵列和波束成形。传统信道估计复杂度高，难以适应快速变化的信道环境。

Method: 通过伯努利-复高斯先验建模稀疏波束空间分量，提出似然比检验检测信号相关元素，并应用硬阈值规则抑制噪声主导分量。

Result: 尽管计算复杂度极低，该方法在信道估计精度上与复杂迭代或基于学习的方法相当。

Conclusion: 理论分析和数值评估表明，该方法适用于资源受限的毫米波系统。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have gained attention as a key
technology for high-capacity wireless systems, owing to the wide available
bandwidth. However, mmWave signals suffer from their inherent characteristics
such as severe path loss, poor scattering, and limited diffraction, which
necessitate the use of large antenna arrays and directional beamforming,
typically implemented through massive MIMO architectures. Accurate channel
estimation is critical in such systems, but its computational complexity
increases proportionally with the number of antennas. This may become a
significant burden in mmWave systems where channels exhibit rapid fluctuations
and require frequent updates. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity
channel denoiser based on Bayesian binary hypothesis testing and beamspace
sparsity. By modeling each sparse beamspace component as a mixture of signal
and noise under a Bernoulli-complex Gaussian prior, we formulate a likelihood
ratio test to detect signal-relevant elements. Then, a hard-thresholding rule
is applied to suppress noise-dominant components in the noisy channel vector.
Despite its extremely low computational complexity, the proposed method
achieves channel estimation accuracy that is comparable to that of complex
iterative or learning-based approaches. This effectiveness is supported by both
theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, suggesting that the method can
be a viable option for mmWave systems with strict resource constraints.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for
6G wireless networks, allowing the joint use of spectrum and infrastructure for
both communication and sensing. While prior ISAC solutions have addressed
resource optimization, including power allocation, beamforming, and waveform
design, they often rely on centralized architectures with full network
knowledge, limiting their scalability in distributed systems. In this paper, we
propose two coordinated decentralized optimization algorithms for beamforming
and power allocation tailored to cell-free ISAC networks. The first algorithm
employs locally designed fixed beamformers at access points (APs), combined
with a centralized power allocation scheme computed at a central server (CS).
The second algorithm jointly optimizes beamforming and power control through a
fully decentralized consensus ADMM framework. Both approaches rely on local
information at APs and limited coordination with the CS. Simulation results
obtained using our proposed Python-based simulation framework evaluate their
fronthaul overhead and system-level performance, demonstrating their
practicality for scalable ISAC deployment in decentralized, cell-free
architectures.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了正交延迟-多普勒分复用（ODDM）调制中的宽带效应（多普勒斜视效应，DSE），分析了其对系统性能的影响，并提出了理论推导和数值验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究忽略了ODDM信号的宽带特性导致的交互色散，可能导致性能下降，因此需要深入研究DSE的影响。

Method: 通过分析多径信道的时变频率响应，解释了DSE引起的额外延迟-多普勒色散，并推导了基于RCP和ZP的宽带ODDM系统的特性。

Result: 理论分析和数值结果表明，DSE会导致额外的延迟-多普勒扩展和更复杂的功率泄漏。

Conclusion: 本文的推导有助于开发ODDM集成感知与通信系统中更精确的信号处理技术。

Abstract: The recently proposed orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM)
modulation has been demonstrated to enjoy excellent reliability over
doubly-dispersive channels. However, most of the prior analysis tends to ignore
the interactive dispersion caused by the wideband property of ODDM signal,
which possibly leads to performance degradation. To solve this problem, we
investigate the input-output relation of ODDM systems considering the wideband
effect, which is also known as the Doppler squint effect (DSE) in the
literature. The extra delay-Doppler (DD) dispersion caused by the DSE is first
explicitly explained by employing the time-variant frequency response of
multipath channels. Its characterization is then derived for both reduced
cyclic prefix (RCP) and zero padded (ZP)-based wideband ODDM systems, where the
extra DD spread and more complicated power leakage outside the peak region are
presented theoretically. Numerical results are finally provided to confirm the
significance of DSE. The derivations in this paper are beneficial for
developing accurate signal processing techniques in ODDM-based integrated
sensing and communication systems.

Conclusion: FA辅助的LM嵌入网络在降低延迟和提高精度方面表现出显著优势，为解决LM量化与网络性能的权衡问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of large model (LM)-embedded wireless
network for handling the trade-off problem of model accuracy and network
latency. To guarantee a high-quality of users' service, the network latency
should be minimized while maintaining an acceptable inference accuracy. To meet
this requirement, LM quantization is proposed to reduce the latency. However,
the excessive quantization may destroy the accuracy of LM inference. To this
end, a promising fluid antenna (FA) technology is investigated for enhancing
the transmission capacity, leading to a lower network latency in the
LM-embedded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network. To design the
FA-assisted LM-embedded network with the lower latency and higher accuracy
requirements, the latency and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) are considered
in the objective function. Then, an efficient optimization algorithm is
proposed under the block coordinate descent framework. Simulation results are
provided to show the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm, and the
performance gains from the proposed FA-assisted LMembedded network over the
other benchmark networks in terms of network latency and PSNR.

Motivation: 随着连接设备数量增加和网络密集化，对射频频谱资源的需求激增，但现有基于监督学习的RAT分类方法依赖大量标记数据，泛化能力存疑。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需标记数据的情况下实现了卓越性能，为未来6G频谱感知提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The growth of the number of connected devices and network densification is
driving an increasing demand for radio network resources, particularly Radio
Frequency (RF) spectrum. Given the dynamic and complex nature of contemporary
wireless environments, characterized by a wide variety of devices and multiple
RATs, spectrum sensing is envisioned to become a building component of future
6G, including as a component within O-RAN or digital twins. However, the
current SotA research for RAT classification predominantly revolves around
supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach that require
extensive labeled dataset. Due to this, it is unclear how existing models
behave in environments for which training data is unavailable thus leaving open
questions regarding their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we
propose a new spectrum sensing workflow in which the model training does not
require any prior knowledge of the RATs transmitting in that area (i.e. no
labelled data) and the class assignment can be easily done through manual
mapping. Furthermore, we adapt a SSL deep clustering architecture capable of
autonomously extracting spectrum features from raw 1D Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) data. We evaluate the proposed architecture on three real-world datasets
from three European cities, in the 868 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.9 GHz bands
containing over 10 RATs and show that the developed model achieves superior
performance by up to 35 percentage points with 22% fewer trainable parameters
and 50% less floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) compared to an SotA
AE-based reference architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的自动调制分类方法需要大量标记信号，且难以应对非固定信号长度、分布偏移和标记信号有限的问题。

Method: 设计了调制信号扩散生成模型（MSDGM）和扩散感知特征融合模块（DAFFus），通过渐进去噪过程和多尺度特征融合学习鲁棒的调制表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，特别是在有限标记、分布偏移和变长信号识别场景下，24类识别任务中SNR≥12dB时准确率达88.27%。

Conclusion: ModFus-DM为无监督自动调制分类提供了高效解决方案，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is essential for wireless
communication systems in both military and civilian applications. However,
existing deep learning-based AMC methods often require large labeled signals
and struggle with non-fixed signal lengths, distribution shifts, and limited
labeled signals. To address these challenges, we propose a modulation-driven
feature fusion via diffusion model (ModFus-DM), a novel unsupervised AMC
framework that leverages the generative capacity of diffusion models for robust
modulation representation learning. We design a modulated signal diffusion
generation model (MSDGM) to implicitly capture structural and semantic
information through a progressive denoising process. Additionally, we propose
the diffusion-aware feature fusion (DAFFus) module, which adaptively aggregates
multi-scale diffusion features to enhance discriminative representation.
Extensive experiments on RML2016.10A, RML2016.10B, RML2018.01A and RML2022
datasets demonstrate that ModFus-DM significantly outperforms existing methods
in various challenging scenarios, such as limited-label settings, distribution
shifts, variable-length signal recognition and channel fading scenarios.
Notably, ModFus-DM achieves over 88.27% accuracy in 24-type recognition tasks
at SNR $\geq $ 12dB with only 10 labeled signals per type.

transfer (WPT) and uplink wireless data transfer (WDT). We derive both exact
analytical expression of the ergodic spectral rate, and asymptotic expression
at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime under Nakagami-m correlated fading
channels. The Mont-Carlo simulation results confirms the accuracy of the
analytical expressions and demonstrate the substantial increase in energy
efficiency of UAV with FAS compared to fixed antenna systems.

Conclusion: 研究成果可推广到超对角RIS、堆叠智能超表面、动态超表面天线和波域物理神经网络等领域。

Abstract: This Letter fills the research gap on physics-consistent optimization for
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with mutual coupling (MC) and
1-bit-tunable elements, a common hardware constraint in existing RIS
prototypes. We compare a model-based method (temperature-annealed
back-propagation) and model-agnostic methods (coordinate descent, genetic
algorithm), and evaluate potential benefits of intelligently initializing these
methods. To facilitate our evaluation, we introduce a technique for generating
statistical ensembles of multiport-network model parameters, wherein a single
hyper-parameter adjusts the MC strength. The technique is a generalization of
Rayleigh fading to radio environments with deterministic programmability, and
it accounts for passivity constraints as well as the coherent-backscattering
effect. We find that, except when MC is negligible, coordinate descent with
random initialization yields the most favorable trade-off in terms of
performance, execution time and memory usage. We expect our findings to extend
to beyond-diagonal RIS, stacked intelligent metasurfaces, dynamic metasurface
antennas, and wave-domain physical neural networks.

Result: 考虑互耦效应在5 dB SNR下带来约5 dB的性能提升。

Conclusion: 改进的RS-LS估计器在复杂环境中显著提升了信道估计性能。

Abstract: The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with extremely
large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays at the base station has
emerged as a key enabler for enhancing wireless network performance. However,
this setup introduces high-dimensional channel matrices, leading to increased
computational complexity and pilot overhead in channel estimation. Mutual
coupling (MC) effects among densely packed unit cells, spatial correlation, and
near-field propagation conditions further complicate the estimation process.
Conventional estimators, such as linear minimum mean square error (MMSE),
require channel statistics that are challenging to acquire for high-dimensional
arrays, while least squares (LS) estimators suffer from performance
limitations. To address these challenges, the reduced-subspace least squares
(RS-LS) estimator leverages array geometry to enhance estimation accuracy. This
work advances the promising RS-LS estimation algorithm by explicitly
incorporating MC effects into the more realistic and challenging near-field
propagation environment within the increasingly relevant generalized RIS-aided
MIMO framework. Additionally, we investigate the impact of MC on the spatial
degrees of freedom (DoF). Our analysis reveals that accounting for MC effects
provides a significant performance gain of approximately 5 dB at an SNR of 5
dB, compared to conventional methods that ignore MC.

Result: 实验表明，该算法显著提升联邦学习的稳定性和有效性，并数学推导了收敛速率。

Conclusion: FedSFR算法通过特征重构优化通信容量利用，提升图像传输质量。

Abstract: Research in semantic communication has garnered considerable attention,
particularly in the area of image transmission, where joint source-channel
coding (JSCC)-based neural network (NN) modules are frequently employed.
However, these systems often experience performance degradation over time due
to an outdated knowledge base, highlighting the need for periodic updates. To
address this challenge in the context of training JSCC modules for image
transmission, we propose a federated learning (FL) algorithm with semantic
feature reconstruction (FR), named FedSFR. This algorithm more efficiently
utilizes the available communication capacity by allowing some of the selected
FL participants to transmit smaller feature vectors instead of local update
information. Unlike conventional FL methods, our approach integrates FR at the
parameter server (PS), stabilizing training and enhancing image transmission
quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
significantly enhances both the stability and effectiveness of the FL process
compared to other algorithms. Furthermore, we mathematically derive the
convergence rate to validate the improved performance.

Conclusion: 分数生成模型在ISAC性能分析、算法设计和系统优化中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a key enabler for
next-generation wireless systems, aiming to support both high-throughput
communication and high-accuracy environmental sensing using shared spectrum and
hardware. Theoretical performance metrics, such as mutual information (MI),
minimum mean squared error (MMSE), and Bayesian Cram\'{e}r--Rao bound (BCRB),
play a key role in evaluating ISAC system performance limits. However, in
practice, hardware impairments, multipath propagation, interference, and scene
constraints often result in nonlinear, multimodal, and non-Gaussian
distributions, making it challenging to derive these metrics analytically.
Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying score-based generative
models to characterize these metrics from data, although not discussed for
ISAC. This paper provides a tutorial-style summary of recent advances in
score-based performance evaluation, with a focus on ISAC systems. We refer to
the summarized framework as scoring ISAC, which not only reflects the core
methodology based on score functions but also emphasizes the goal of scoring
(i.e., evaluating) ISAC systems under realistic conditions. We present the
connections between classical performance metrics and the score functions and
provide the practical training techniques for learning score functions to
estimate performance metrics. Proof-of-concept experiments on target detection
and localization validate the accuracy of score-based performance estimators
against ground-truth analytical expressions, illustrating their ability to
replicate and extend traditional analyses in more complex, realistic settings.
This framework demonstrates the great potential of score-based generative
models in ISAC performance analysis, algorithm design, and system optimization.

Abstract: Contactless cardiac monitoring has vast potential to replace contact-based
monitoring in various future scenarios such as smart home and in-cabin
monitoring. Various contactless sensors can be potentially implemented for
cardiac monitoring, such as cameras, acoustic sensors, Wi-Fi routers and
radars. Among all these sensors, radar could achieve unobtrusive monitoring
with high accuracy and robustness at the same time. The research about
radar-based cardiac monitoring can be generally divided into the radar
architecture design and signal-processing parts, where the former has been
thoroughly reviewed in the literature but not the latter. To the best of the
author knowledge, this is the first review paper that focuses on elaborating
the algorithms for extracting cardiac features from the received radar signal.
In addition, a new taxonomy is proposed to reveal the core feature of each
algorithm, with the pros and cons evaluated in detail. Furthermore, the public
datasets containing the received radar signal and ground-truth cardiac feature
signal are listed with detailed configurations, and the corresponding
evaluations may help the researchers select the suitable dataset. At last,
several unsolved challenges and future directions are suggested and discussed
in detail to encourage future research on solving the main obstacles in this
field. In summary, this review can be served as a guide for researchers and
practitioners to quickly understand the research trend and recent development
of the cardiac feature extraction algorithms, and it is worth further
investigating the relative area based on the proposed challenges and future
directions.

Result: 分布式MIMO的DPBF方法比共置MIMO的DPBF具有更好的覆盖范围。

Conclusion: DPBF在分布式MIMO中表现更优，为NLoS条件下的波束成形提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Broad beam beamforming (BF) design in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
can be convenient for initial access, synchronization, and sensing capabilities
in cellular networks by avoiding overheads of sweeping methods while making
efficient use of resources. Phase-only BF is key for maximizing power
efficiency across antennas. A successful method to produce broad beams is the
phase-only dual-polarization BF (DPBF). However, its efficiency has not been
proved in non-line-of-sight (NLoS). Therefore, this paper contributes by
evaluating DPBF in collocated and distributed MIMO configurations under both
line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS channel conditions. We model the reflection
coefficients for different materials in NLoS conditions and propose the use of
orthogonal space-time block code to improve the coverage compared to the DPBF
in collocated MIMO (C-MIMO). We further propose a DPBF method for distributed
MIMO and show that it achieves better coverage than C-MIMO with DPBF.

Abstract: In uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, pilot signal
design is crucial for enabling accurate channel estimation and reliable radar
sensing. In orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based
frameworks, conventional pilot allocation schemes face a trade-off between
spectral efficiency (SE) and sensing performance. Interleaved pilots improve
user equipment (UE) multiplexing through sparse allocation but reduce the
maximum unambiguous range. Conversely, orthogonal block-based pilots reduce
range ambiguity but degrade sensing resolution due to limited delay
granularity. To address this trade-off, the phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) scheme
was recently proposed for uplink multiple access in ISAC systems. However,
PS-ISAC suffers from spectral inefficiency due to the fixed cyclic prefix (CP)
constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose adaptive
phase-shifted-ISAC (APS-ISAC), an enhanced pilot scheme that employs an
overlapped block-pilot structure with UE-specific phase shifts determined by
maximum excess delay of each UE. This design enables UEs to share the same
time-frequency resources while preserving separable and contiguous channel
impulse responses (CIRs) at the base station (BS). Simulation results show that
APS-ISAC significantly outperforms conventional pilot allocation methods in
terms of SE, approximately doubling the number of multiplexed UEs. It also
achieves lower mean square error (MSE) under power constraints with reduced
complexity. Furthermore, it yields maximum range resolution and unambiguous
sensing performance. These results establish APS-ISAC as a scalable, spectrally
efficient, ambiguity-resilient, and low-complexity pilot design paradigm for
future uplink ISAC systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测马匹的呼吸参数（如呼吸率）有助于了解训练对其健康和表现的影响，从而改善马匹福利。

Method: 研究比较了基于深度学习的方法（时间卷积网络和长短时记忆网络）与信号处理方法，用于检测呼吸事件和计算动态呼吸率。

Result: 时间卷积网络在检测呼气声音和估计动态呼吸率方面表现最佳（F1分数中位数0.94，MAE±CI：1.44±1.04 bpm）。

Conclusion: 这是首次自动检测马匹呼吸声音并计算动态呼吸率的研究，未来将验证模型在低强度运动和其他麦克风放置位置的适用性。

Abstract: Monitoring respiration parameters such as respiratory rate could be
beneficial to understand the impact of training on equine health and
performance and ultimately improve equine welfare. In this work, we compare
deep learning-based methods to an adapted signal processing method to
automatically detect cyclic respiratory events and extract the dynamic
respiratory rate from microphone recordings during high intensity exercise in
Standardbred trotters. Our deep learning models are able to detect exhalation
sounds (median F1 score of 0.94) in noisy microphone signals and show promising
results on unlabelled signals at lower exercising intensity, where the
exhalation sounds are less recognisable. Temporal convolutional networks were
better at detecting exhalation events and estimating dynamic respiratory rates
(median F1: 0.94, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) $\pm$ Confidence Intervals (CI):
1.44$\pm$1.04 bpm, Limits Of Agreements (LOA): 0.63$\pm$7.06 bpm) than long
short-term memory networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE$\pm$CI: 3.11$\pm$1.58 bpm) and
signal processing methods (MAE$\pm$CI: 2.36$\pm$1.11 bpm). This work is the
first to automatically detect equine respiratory sounds and automatically
compute dynamic respiratory rates in exercising horses. In the future, our
models will be validated on lower exercising intensity sounds and different
microphone placements will be evaluated in order to find the best combination
for regular monitoring.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了高占空比视觉刺激对减轻SSVEP应用中视觉疲劳的影响，发现85%占空比能显著减少疲劳并提高响应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSVEP技术因视觉疲劳和高精度PWM调制的困难限制了其长期使用，需要找到解决方案。

Method: 通过精确设计的LED硬件生成50%至95%占空比的PWM刺激，记录10名受试者的脑电图数据。

Result: 高占空比（尤其是85%）显著减少视觉疲劳，且SSVEP响应性能达到峰值。

Conclusion: 85%占空比的视觉刺激可能成为SSVEP实际应用中的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based
diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high
information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through
simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual
stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use
preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in
establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer
accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these
issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual
stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor
response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high
duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints.
Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95%
generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten
subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all
the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak
response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of
SSVEP for practical applications.

Motivation: 由于EEG数据情感状态估计的可靠性存在争议，且缺乏标准化评估协议，研究旨在揭示现有研究中的方法学问题及其影响。

Method: 通过回顾101项研究（主要基于DEAP数据集），分析数据泄露、特征选择、超参数优化等问题，并通过实验验证这些问题的实际影响。

Result: 87%的研究存在方法学错误，这些错误可能导致分类准确率虚高46%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了标准化评估实践的不足和同行评审的缺陷，呼吁更严格的方法学标准和评估协议。

Abstract: The reliability of affective state estimation using EEG data is in question,
given the variability in reported performance and the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols. To investigate this, we reviewed 101 studies, focusing on
the widely used DEAP dataset for emotion recognition. Our analysis revealed
widespread methodological issues that include data leakage from improper
segmentation, biased feature selection, flawed hyperparameter optimization,
neglect of class imbalance, and insufficient methodological reporting. Notably,
we found that nearly 87% of the reviewed papers contained one or more of these
errors. Moreover, through experimental analysis, we observed that such
methodological flaws can inflate the classification accuracy by up to 46%.
These findings reveal fundamental gaps in standardized evaluation practices and
highlight critical deficiencies in the peer review process for machine learning
applications in neuroscience, emphasizing the urgent need for stricter
methodological standards and evaluation protocols.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化源节点和目的节点功率分配的方法，以最大化无线网络在有限时间内的平均保密能量效率（SEE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过利用目的节点的全双工能力发送干扰信号，提升网络保密性，同时源节点和目的节点均具备能量收集能力，但电池容量有限。

Method: 将问题建模为有限时域强化学习（RL）问题，提出有限时域联合功率分配（FHJPA）算法，并与低复杂度贪婪算法（GA）和无限时域联合功率分配（IHJPA）算法进行比较。

Result: FHJPA算法在SEE、预期总传输保密比特数和计算复杂度方面优于GA和IHJPA算法。当源节点电池能量充足时，GA性能接近FHJPA；传输时域增加时，IHJPA性能差距减小。FHJPA计算时间比IHJPA少16.6%。

Conclusion: FHJPA算法在有限时域传输中表现最佳，GA在低复杂度下表现接近，IHJPA在长时域下性能提升。

Abstract: In this paper, a joint optimal allocation of transmit power at the source and
jamming power at the destination is proposed to maximize the average secrecy
energy efficiency (SEE) of a wireless network within a finite time duration.
The destination transmits the jamming signal to improve secrecy by utilizing
full-duplex capability. The source and destination both have energy harvesting
(EH) capability with limited battery capacity. Due to the Markov nature of the
system, the problem is formulated as a finite-horizon reinforcement learning
(RL) problem. We propose the finite-horizon joint power allocation (FHJPA)
algorithm for the finite-horizon RL problem and compare it with a
low-complexity greedy algorithm (GA). An infinite-horizon joint power
allocation (IHJPA) algorithm is also proposed for the corresponding
infinite-horizon problem. A comparative analysis of these algorithms is carried
out in terms of SEE, expected total transmitted secure bits, and computational
complexity. The results show that the FHJPA algorithm outperforms the GA and
IHJPA algorithms due to its appropriate modelling in finite horizon
transmission. When the source node battery has sufficient energy, the GA can
yield performance close to the FHJPA algorithm despite its low-complexity. When
the transmission time horizon increases, the accuracy of the infinite-horizon
model improves, resulting in a reduced performance gap between FHJPA and IHJPA
algorithms. The computational time comparison shows that the FHJPA algorithm
takes $16.6$ percent less time than the IHJPA algorithm.

*Anton Björkman,Filip Elvander*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于最优传输理论的多音高估计方法，通过解耦正则化和字典设计，提高了对噪声和谐波失真的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有压缩感知方法在多音高估计中存在的相干性问题和谐波失真现象。

Method: 使用最优传输理论的正则化方法，将信号的频谱内容分配给少量谐波系列，并提出了两种估计方法（随机和确定性信号）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的实验表明，该方法优于传统统计信号处理方法，与基于网络的方法相当或更好。

Conclusion: 该方法在多音高估计中表现出色，尤其在鲁棒性和性能上优于现有技术。

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of multi-pitch estimation, i.e.,
identifying super-imposed truncated harmonic series from noisy measurements. We
phrase this as recovering a harmonically-structured measure on the unit circle,
where the structure is enforced using regularizers based on optimal transport
theory. In the resulting framework, a signal's spectral content is
simultaneously inferred and assigned, or transported, to a small set of
harmonic series defined by their corresponding fundamental frequencies. In
contrast to existing methods from the compressed sensing paradigm, the proposed
framework decouples regularization and dictionary design and mitigates
coherency problems. As a direct consequence, this also introduces robustness to
the phenomenon of inharmonicity. From this framework, we derive two estimation
methods, one for stochastic and one for deterministic signals, and propose
efficient numerical algorithms implementing them. In numerical studies on both
synthetic and real data, the proposed methods are shown to achieve better
estimation performance as compared to other methods from statistical signal
processing literature. Furthermore, they perform comparably or better than
network-based methods, except when the latter are specially trained on the
data-type considered and are given access to considerably more data during
inference.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于OFDM信号的直接位置估计（DPE）的理论极限和性能，推导了其Cramér-Rao界（CRB），并与传统两步定位方法在NLOS多径环境中的性能进行了对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DPE在OFDM定位系统中的理论极限和性能，尤其是在NLOS多径环境中的表现。

Method: 推导了基于OFDM信号的DPE的CRB，并与传统两步定位方法进行性能对比。

Result: DPE在所有评估条件下均优于两步方法；大带宽和增加子载波间距对性能至关重要；多符号定位显著提升精度，但增加符号数带来的改进有限且计算复杂度高。

Conclusion: DPE在OFDM系统中具有显著优势，但需权衡符号数量和计算复杂度。

Abstract: Although direct position estimation (DPE) has been demonstrated to offer
enhanced robustness in GNSS receivers, its theoretical limits and performance
in OFDM based positioning systems remain largely unexplored. In this paper, the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for DPE using OFDM based cellular signals is derived
and benchmarked against the conventional two-step positioning method to assess
their relative performance in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) dominated multipath
environments. Numerical results reveal that 1) the DPE method consistently
outperforms the two-step approach in OFDM systems under all evaluated
conditions; 2) a large bandwidth is crucial in both methods, and increasing
subcarrier spacing is more beneficial for a fixed bandwidth; 3) utilizing
multiple OFDM symbols for positioning leads to substantial improvements in
localization accuracy compared to relying on a single symbol. However, further
increasing the number of symbols yields marginal improvements while
significantly increasing computational complexity.
