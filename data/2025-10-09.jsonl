We propose a new\nstrategy for Poisson denoising based on training a log-network. Instead of\npredicting the posterior mean $ \\mathbb{E}[x \\mid y] $, the log-network is\ntrained to learn $\\mathbb{E}[\\log x \\mid y]$, leveraging the logarithm as a\nconvenient parameterization for the Poisson distribution. We provide a\ntheoretical proof that the proposed log-network enables recovery of\nhigher-order posterior moments and thus supports posterior approximation.\nExperiments on simulated data show that our method matches the denoising\nperformance of standard MMSE models while providing access to the posterior."}

Goldsmith"], "title": "Spectral Graph Clustering under Differential Privacy: Balancing Privacy, Accuracy, and Efficiency", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the problem of spectral graph clustering under edge differential\nprivacy (DP). Specifically, we develop three mechanisms: (i) graph perturbation\nvia randomized edge flipping combined with adjacency matrix shuffling, which\nenforces edge privacy while preserving key spectral properties of the graph.\nImportantly, shuffling considerably amplifies the guarantees: whereas flipping\nedges with a fixed probability alone provides only a constant epsilon edge DP\nguarantee as the number of nodes grows, the shuffled mechanism achieves\n(epsilon, delta) edge DP with parameters that tend to zero as the number of\nnodes increase; (ii) private graph projection with additive Gaussian noise in a\nlower-dimensional space to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity;\nand (iii) a noisy power iteration method that distributes Gaussian noise across\niterations to ensure edge DP while maintaining convergence. Our analysis\nprovides rigorous privacy guarantees and a precise characterization of the\nmisclassification error rate. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks\nvalidate our theoretical analysis and illustrate the practical privacy-utility\ntrade-offs."}

Each\nuser-centric cluster processor responsible for cluster-level signal processing\nis located at one of multiple decentralized units (DUs). Thus, the radio units\nin the cluster must exchange data with the corresponding DU over the fronthaul.\nBecause the fronthaul links have limited capacity, this data must be quantized\nbefore it is sent over the fronthaul. We consider a routed fronthaul network,\nwhere the cluster processor placement and fronthaul traffic routing are jointly\noptimized with a mixed-integer linear program. For different numbers of users\nin the network, we investigate the effect of fronthaul quantization rates, a\nsystem parameter computed based on rate-distortion theory. Our results show\nthat with optimized quantization rates, the fronthaul load is quite stable for\na wide range of user loads without significant PHY performance loss. This\ndemonstrates that the cell-free massive MIMO PHY and fronthaul network are\nresilient to varying user densities."}

Conventional communication systems employ channel estimation\nprocedures that impose significant overhead during data transmission, consuming\nresources that could otherwise be utilized for data. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a state-based approach that leverages sensing capabilities to track\nthe user when there is no communication request. Upon receiving a communication\nrequest, predictive beamforming is employed based on the tracked user position,\nthereby reducing the need for channel estimation. Our framework incorporates an\nextended Kalman filter (EKF) based tracking algorithm with adaptive sensing\nmanagement to perform sensing operations only when necessary to maintain high\ntracking accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sensing\nmanagement approach provides uniform downlink communication rates that are\nhigher than with existing methods by achieving overhead-free predictive\nbeamforming."}
