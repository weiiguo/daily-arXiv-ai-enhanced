While a larger scaling factor can reduce the effective noise power and\nimprove training performance, it also compromises the privacy of devices by\nreducing uncertainty. In this work, we aim to adaptively design the receive\nscaling factors across training rounds to balance the trade-off between\ntraining convergence and privacy in an FL system under dynamic channel\nconditions. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the\noverall R\\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) leakage over the entire training\nprocess, subject to a long-term constraint that ensures convergence of the\nglobal loss function. Our problem depends on unknown future information, and we\nobserve that standard Lyapunov optimization is not applicable. Thus, we develop\na new online algorithm, termed AdaScale, based on a sequence of novel per-round\nproblems that can be solved efficiently. We further derive upper bounds on the\ndynamic regret and constraint violation of AdaSacle, establishing that it\nachieves diminishing dynamic regret in terms of time-averaged RDP leakage while\nensuring convergence of FL training to a stationary point.

In practical wireless systems, domain shifts occur\nfrequently due to dynamic channel statistics, moving obstacles, or hardware\nconfiguration. Thus, there is a need for learning frameworks that can achieve\nrobust generalization under scarce multi-modal data in wireless networks. In\nthis paper, a novel and data-efficient two-phase learning framework is proposed\nto improve generalization performance in unseen and unfamiliar wireless\nenvironments with minimal amount of multi-modal data. In the first stage, a\nphysics-based loss function is employed to enable each BS to learn the physics\nunderlying its wireless environment captured by multi-modal data. The\ndata-efficiency of the physics-based loss function is analytically\ninvestigated. In the second stage, collaborative domain adaptation is proposed\nto leverage the wireless environment knowledge of multiple BSs to guide\nunder-performing BSs under domain shift. Specifically, domain-similarity-aware\nmodel aggregation is proposed to utilize the knowledge of BSs that experienced\nsimilar domains. To validate the proposed framework, a new dataset generation\nframework is developed by integrating CARLA and MATLAB-based mmWave channel\nmodeling to predict mmWave RSS.

The bound separates two effects: (i) an irreducible term\ndetermined by the graph's maximum node degree, and (ii) a design-controlled\nterm that shrinks as the regularisation strength increases (following an\ninverse square-root law). This leads to a simple design rule: given any target\nlimit on spread, one can choose a sufficient regularisation strength in closed\nform. Although one motivating application is array beamforming, where the\ninitial pattern is the squared magnitude of the beamformer weights, the result\napplies to any scenario that first enforces Laplacian smoothness and then\nevolves by linear diffusion on a graph. Overall, the guarantee is\nnon-asymptotic, easy to compute, and certifies how much steady-state deviation\ncan occur."}

While a larger scaling factor can reduce the effective noise power and\nimprove training performance, it also compromises the privacy of devices by\nreducing uncertainty. In this work, we aim to adaptively design the receive\nscaling factors across training rounds to balance the trade-off between\ntraining convergence and privacy in an FL system under dynamic channel\nconditions. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the\noverall R\\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) leakage over the entire training\nprocess, subject to a long-term constraint that ensures convergence of the\nglobal loss function. Our problem depends on unknown future information, and we\nobserve that standard Lyapunov optimization is not applicable. Thus, we develop\na new online algorithm, termed AdaScale, based on a sequence of novel per-round\nproblems that can be solved efficiently. We further derive upper bounds on the\ndynamic regret and constraint violation of AdaSacle, establishing that it\nachieves diminishing dynamic regret in terms of time-averaged RDP leakage while\nensuring convergence of FL training to a stationary point. Numerical\nexperiments on canonical classification tasks show that our approach\neffectively reduces RDP and DP leakages compared with state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks without compromising learning performance."}

We assume that the objective function $f$ is known to\nall agents and each feasible set is a collection of points from a universal\nalphabet $\\mathcal{P}_{alph}$. A designated agent (leader) starts the\ncommunication with the remaining (non-leader) agents, and is the first to\nretrieve the solution set. The leader searches for the solution by sending\nqueries to and receiving answers from the non-leaders, such that the\ninformation on the individual feasible sets revealed to the leader should be no\nmore than nominal, i.e., what is revealed from learning the solution set alone.\nWe develop achievable schemes for obtaining the solution set at nominal\ninformation leakage, and characterize their communication costs under two\ncommunication setups between agents. In this work, we focus on two kinds of\nnetwork setups: i) ring, where each agent communicates with two adjacent\nagents, and ii) star, where only the leader communicates with the remaining\nagents. We show that, if the leader first learns the joint feasible set through\nan existing private set intersection (PSI) protocol and then deduces the\nsolution set, the information leaked to the leader is greater than nominal.\nMoreover, we draw connection of our schemes to threshold PSI (ThPSI), which is\na PSI-variant where the intersection is revealed only when its cardinality is\nlarger than a threshold value. Finally, for various realizations of $f$ mapped\nuniformly at random to a fixed range of values, our schemes are more\ncommunication-efficient with a high probability compared to retrieving the\nentire feasible set through PSI."}
