Developing\naccurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated\ndata, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by\nproviding researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared\nlearning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of\ncrowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing\n353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The\ndata was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out\nvalidation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background\npatterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a\nmachine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity\nof EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4\nperforming models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation\ndataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset,\ndeep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had\na significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing\nperformance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen\ndata, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with\nneonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on\nlarge and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation. The competition's\noutcome demonstrates the potential for open-access data and collaborative ML\ndevelopment to foster a collaborative research environment and expedite the\ndevelopment of clinical decision-support tools for neonatal neuromonitoring."}

Different from\nthe existing works primarily focusing on decoder-side estimation of intrinsic\nmeaning and ignoring its inherent issues, such as ambiguity and polysemy, we\nexploit a constraint of conditional semantic probability distortion to\neffectively capture the essential features of practical semantic exchanges in\nan AI-assisted communication system. With the help of the methods in\nrate-distortion-perception theory, we establish a theorem specifying the\nminimum achievable rate under this semantic constraint and a traditional\nsymbolic constraint and obtain its closed-form limit for a particular semantic\nscenario. From the experiments in this paper, bounding conditional semantic\nprobability distortion can effectively improve both semantic transmission\naccuracy and bit-rate efficiency. Our framework bridges information theory and\nAI, enabling potential applications in bandwidth-efficient semantic-aware\nnetworks, enhanced transceiver understanding, and optimized semantic\ntransmission for AI-driven systems."}
