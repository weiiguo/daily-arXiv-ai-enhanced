In Zak-OTFS, this trade-off requires balancing\nthe need for localization for input/output (I/O) relation estimation with the\nneed for orthogonality for reliable data detection when operating without time\nor bandwidth expansion. The well-known sinc and Gaussian pulse shapes represent\nthe canonical extremes of this trade-off, while composite constructions such as\nthe Gaussian-sinc (GS) pulse shape offer a good compromise. In this work, we\npropose a systematic DD pulse design framework for Zak-OTFS that expresses the\npulse as a linear combination of Hermite basis functions. We obtain the optimal\ncoefficients for the Hermite basis functions that minimize the inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI) energy at the DD sampling points by solving a constrained\noptimization problem via singular value decomposition. For the proposed class\nof Hermite pulses, we derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and\nnoise covariance in Zak-OTFS. Simulation results of Zak-OTFS with embedded\npilot and model-free I/O relation estimation in Vehicular-A channels with\nfractional DDs demonstrate that the optimized pulse shape achieves a bit error\nrate performance that is significantly superior compared to those of the\ncanonical sinc and Gaussian pulses and is on par with that of the\nstate-of-the-art GS pulse, validating the proposed framework which provides\ngreater design flexibility in terms of control of ISI and sidelobe energies."}
