### [1] [Improved Bounds on Access-Redundancy Tradeoffs in Quantized Linear Computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00183)
*Ching-Fang Li,Mary Wootters*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文改进了量化线性函数计算的不可行性结果，并首次研究了近似恢复问题，提出了优于精确方案的构造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在有限查询次数下高效计算量化线性函数，并探索近似恢复的可能性。

Method: 改进了一般问题和特定构造类（块构造）的不可行性结果，并提出了近似恢复的构造方法。

Result: 证明了块构造的优化性，并展示了近似恢复构造在ε=0.1时的优越性。

Conclusion: 本文在量化线性函数计算领域取得了理论进展，为近似恢复提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Consider the problem of computing quantized linear functions with only a few
queries. Formally, given $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^k$, our goal is to encode
$\mathbf{x}$ as $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, for $n > k$, so that for any
$\mathbf{w} \in A^k$, $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}$ can be computed using at most
$\ell$ queries to $\mathbf{c}$. Here, $A$ is some finite set; in this paper we
focus on the case where $|A| = 2$.
  Prior work \emph{(Ramkumar, Raviv, and Tamo, Trans. IT, 2024)} has given
constructions and established impossibility results for this problem. We give
improved impossibility results, both for the general problem, and for the
specific class of construction (block construction) presented in that work. The
latter establishes that the block constructions of prior work are optimal
within that class.
  We also initiate the study of \emph{approximate} recovery for this problem,
where the goal is not to recover $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}$ exactly but rather
to approximate it up to a parameter $\varepsilon > 0$. We give several
constructions, and give constructions for $\varepsilon = 0.1$ that outperform
our impossibility result for exact schemes.

### [2] [Channel Estimation for Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces: From Model-Based Approaches to Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00268)
*Jian Xiao,Ji Wang,Qimei Cui,Yucang Yang,Xingwang Li,Dusit Niyato,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了柔性智能超表面（FIM）辅助毫米波通信系统中的信道估计问题，提出了基于模型和深度学习的框架，其中层次傅里叶神经算子（H-FNO）显著优于基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FIM通过动态变形实现多径信号的相长干涉，但其性能依赖于高维变形空间中的准确信道状态信息，因此需要解决信道估计问题。

Method: 开发了基于模型的框架（插值、核方法和稀疏信号恢复）和深度学习框架（FNO和H-FNO），用于学习FIM形状与信道响应的映射。

Result: 数值结果表明，H-FNO在估计精度和导频效率上显著优于基准方法，并能准确重建非线性信道响应。

Conclusion: H-FNO通过学习适应FIM物理几何的各向异性空间滤波器，有效解决了FIM系统中的信道估计问题。

Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) offer a new solution for wireless
communications by introducing morphological degrees of freedom, dynamically
morphing their three-dimensional shape to ensure multipath signals interfere
constructively. However, realizing the desired performance gains in FIM systems
is critically dependent on acquiring accurate channel state information across
a continuous and high-dimensional deformation space. Therefore, this paper
investigates this fundamental channel estimation problem for FIM assisted
millimeter-wave communication systems. First, we develop model-based frameworks
that structure the problem as either function approximation using interpolation
and kernel methods or as a sparse signal recovery problem that leverages the
inherent angular sparsity of millimeter-wave channels. To further advance the
estimation capability beyond explicit assumptions in model-based channel
estimation frameworks, we propose a deep learning-based framework using a
Fourier neural operator (FNO). By parameterizing a global convolution operator
in the Fourier domain, we design an efficient FNO architecture to learn the
continuous operator that maps FIM shapes to channel responses with
mesh-independent properties. Furthermore, we exploit a hierarchical FNO (H-FNO)
architecture to efficiently capture the multi-scale features across a hierarchy
of spatial resolutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed H-FNO
significantly outperforms the model-based benchmarks in estimation accuracy and
pilot efficiency. In particular, the interpretability analysis show that the
proposed H-FNO learns an anisotropic spatial filter adapted to the physical
geometry of FIM and is capable of accurately reconstructing the non-linear
channel response across the continuous deformation space.

### [3] [Active IRS-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communications with Extended Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00379)
*Yuan Fang,Xianxin Song,Huazhou Hou,Ziguo Zhong,Xianghao Yu,Jie Xu,Yongming Huang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了主动智能反射面（IRS）支持的集成传感与通信（ISAC），通过优化波束成形最小化传感CRB，同时满足通信用户SINR需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非视距（NLoS）区域通信与传感的路径损耗问题，提升系统性能。

Method: 联合优化基站发射波束成形和主动IRS反射波束成形，提出交替优化算法。

Result: 主动IRS在实用系统设置下总是使用最大放大增益，验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 主动IRS支持的ISAC优于被动IRS，为NLoS场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies the active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), in which an active IRS is
deployed to assist the base station (BS) in serving multiple communication
users (CUs) and simultaneously sensing an \emph{extended} target at the
non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area of the BS. The active IRS has the capability of
amplifying the reflected signals so as to overcome significant reflection path
loss in NLoS communication and sensing. In particular, we derive the sensing
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target response matrix.
Accordingly, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and the
reflective beamforming at the active IRS to minimize the sensing CRB, subject
to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements at the CUs,
the transmit power budgets at the BS and active IRS, as well as the power
amplification gain constraints at the active IRS. The CRB minimization problem
is highly non-convex and thus difficult to solve in general. To address this
challenge, we first focus on two specified conditions by considering the
sensing-only scenario via ignoring the SINR constraints for communications, for
which the closed-form optimal transmit beamforming is derived. Then, we propose
two efficient alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms to obtain
high-quality solutions for the general ISAC scenarios. Next, we analyze the
inherent relationship between the power scaling at the BS and the amplification
scaling at the active IRS. It is shown that the active IRS always amplifies the
signal using the maximum amplification gain under practical system settings.
Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed AO-based algorithms and the benefits of active IRS-enabled ISAC
compared to its passive IRSs counterparts.

### [4] [LO-Aware Adaptive Modulation for Rydberg Atomic Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00458)
*Jiuyu Liu,Yi Ma,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专为Rydberg原子接收器设计的LOAM调制方案，通过动态适应复杂信道系数，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rydberg原子接收器仅能检测信号幅度而丢失相位信息，现有调制方案表现不佳，亟需创新方案。

Method: 提出LOAM方案，动态适应信道系数，采用自适应共线星座架构，根据参考信号强度调整星座点分布。

Result: 仿真结果显示LOAM性能提升超过45 dB，优于传统调制方案。

Conclusion: LOAM为量子无线通信提供了高效调制方案，解决了相位信息丢失问题。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic (RA) receivers represent a revolutionary quantum technology
for wireless communications, offering unprecedented sensitivity beyond
conventional radio frequency (RF) antennas. However, these receivers detect
only signal amplitude, losing critical phase information. While reference
signals generated by a local oscillator (LO) can assist in phase recovery,
existing modulation schemes designed for conventional systems perform poorly
with this quantum detection mechanism. This paper introduces a breakthrough
LO-aware adaptive modulation (LOAM) scheme specifically developed for RA
receivers that dynamically adapts to complex fading channel coefficients. LOAM
maximizes the minimum amplitude difference between constellation points,
ensuring optimal detection performance. The innovation employs an adaptive
co-linear constellation architecture aligned with the combined phase of
reference signal and channel coefficient. For strong reference signals, LOAM
generates symmetric constellation points centered at origin; for weak signals,
it adopts non-symmetric distributions. The paper mathematically derives the
threshold governing these operational regimes. Simulation results reveal the
transformative impact of LOAM, demonstrating performance gains exceeding 45 dB
over conventional modulation schemes, including quadrature amplitude modulation
(QAM), phase-shift keying (PSK), and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM).

### [5] [Towards a Measure Theory of Semantic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00525)
*George M. Coghill*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文批判了Floridi的强语义信息理论，并提出了一种基于单位圆的新方法，解决了Bar-Hillel-Carnap悖论，同时满足Floridi的要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Floridi理论未能消除Bar-Hillel-Carnap悖论的问题，并提出更有效的语义信息量化方法。

Method: 基于单位圆和冯·诺伊曼量子概率类比，构建信息度量空间。

Result: 新方法成功消除悖论，矛盾和对立消息具有相同的信息量。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅满足Floridi的要求，还提供了更合理的语义信息量化框架。

Abstract: A classic account of the quantification of semantic information is that of
Bar-Hiller and Carnap. Their account proposes an inverse relation between the
informativeness of a statement and its probability. However, their approach
assigns the maximum informativeness to a contradiction: which Floridi refers to
as the Bar-Hillel-Carnap paradox. He developed a novel theory founded on a
distance metric and parabolic relation, designed to remove this paradox.
Unfortunately is approach does not succeed in that aim.
  In this paper I critique Floridi's theory of strongly semantic information on
its own terms and show where it succeeds and fails. I then present a new
approach based on the unit circle (a relation that has been the basis of
theories from basic trigonometry to quantum theory). This is used, by analogy
with von Neumann's quantum probability to construct a measure space for
informativeness that meets all the requirements stipulated by Floridi and
removes the paradox. In addition, while contradictions and tautologies have
zero informativeness, it is found that messages which are contradictory to each
other are equally informative. The utility of this is explained by means of an
example.

expressions for various modulation schemes and system configurations.

### [7] [Information-Theoretic Decentralized Secure Aggregation with Collusion Resilience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00596)
*Xiang Zhang,Zhou Li,Shuangyang Li,Kai Wan,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了去中心化联邦学习中的安全聚合问题，从信息论角度分析了通信和密钥使用的最优界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注协议设计和计算保证，但对信息论基础限制和去中心化环境下的通信与密钥使用最优界限缺乏理解。

Method: 研究了一个由K个全连接用户组成的网络，每个用户持有私有输入，目标是安全计算所有输入的和，同时满足安全性约束。

Result: 确定了最优速率区域，表明每个用户必须传输至少一个符号、持有至少一个密钥符号，且所有用户需共同持有不少于K-1个独立密钥符号。

Conclusion: 研究结果为分布式学习系统中设计可证明安全和通信高效的协议提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively
learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held
datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the
intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques
are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite
growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on
protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the
fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal
bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings,
where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the
problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic
perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users,
each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who
aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires
that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up
to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies
the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In
particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input
sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at
least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no
fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the
fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of
provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning
systems.

### [8] [Deep Learning-Based Rate-Adaptive CSI Feedback for Wideband XL-MIMO Systems in the Near-Field Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00626)
*Zhenyu Liu,Yi Ma,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为WideNLNet-CA的深度学习框架，用于在宽带近场XL-MIMO系统中实现高效的CSI反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在6G网络中，XL-MIMO系统的频谱效率增益依赖于准确且高效的CSI反馈，但近场球面波传播和宽带场景中的频率依赖性波束分裂效应带来了挑战。

Method: WideNLNet-CA采用轻量级编码器-解码器架构，结合多阶段下采样和上采样，以及计算高效的残差块来捕捉多尺度信道特征。此外，引入压缩比自适应模块动态调整特征选择。

Result: 实验表明，WideNLNet-CA在不同压缩比和带宽下均优于现有方法，同时保持快速推理和低存储需求。

Conclusion: WideNLNet-CA为宽带近场XL-MIMO系统中的CSI反馈提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is crucial
for unlocking the substantial spectral efficiency gains of extremely
large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems in future 6G networks. However, the
combination of near-field spherical wave propagation and frequency-dependent
beam split effects in wideband scenarios poses significant challenges for CSI
representation and compression. This paper proposes WideNLNet-CA, a
rate-adaptive deep learning framework designed to enable efficient CSI feedback
in wideband near-field XL-MIMO systems. WideNLNet-CA introduces a lightweight
encoder-decoder architecture with multi-stage downsampling and upsampling,
incorporating computationally efficient residual blocks to capture complex
multi-scale channel features with reduced overhead. A novel compression ratio
adaptive module with feature importance estimation is introduced to dynamically
modulate feature selection based on target compression ratios, enabling
flexible adaptation across a wide range of feedback rates using a single model.
Evaluation results demonstrate that WideNLNet-CA consistently outperforms
existing compressive sensing and deep learning-based works across various
compression ratios and bandwidths, while maintaining fast inference and low
model storage requirements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宽带系统中的ISRS和通道依赖性损耗难以准确估计，需要数值方法，因此提出一种更高效的闭式表达式。

Method: 推导了一个闭式表达式，用于计算通道功率分布，并通过数值方法验证其准确性。

Result: 表达式在单跨度和多跨度光纤链路中均表现出高准确性，并推导了逆表达式用于目标OSNR分布。

Conclusion: 提出的闭式表达式为宽带系统设计提供了高效工具，可用于优化OSNR分布。

Abstract: Wideband systems experience significant inter-channel stimulated Raman
scattering (ISRS) and channel-dependent losses. Due to the non-uniform
attenuation profile, the combined effects of ISRS and fiber loss can only be
accurately estimated using numerical methods. In this work, we present an
approximate closed-form expression for the channels' power profile accounting
for these combined effects. We validate the proposed expression against
numerical solutions in the case of CLU transmission, showing high accuracy for
both single-span and multi-span fiber-optic links. Additionally, we derive an
inverse expression, formulated as a function of the output power, which can be
utilized to target a desired optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) profile
through pre-emphasis of the launched channel powers.

### [10] [RIS-MAE: A Self-Supervised Modulation Classification Method Based on Raw IQ Signals and Masked Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00274)
*Yunfei Liu,Mingxuan Liu,Wupeng Xie,Xinzhu Liu,Wenxue Liu,Yangang Sun,Xin Qiu,Cui Yuan,Jinhai Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督学习框架RIS-MAE，用于自动调制分类，解决了现有方法依赖时频图像和大量标注数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动调制分类（AMC）是智能无线通信系统的基础技术，但主流方法依赖时频图像和大量标注数据，限制了其适应性和实用性。

Method: RIS-MAE基于掩码自编码器，直接从原始IQ序列中学习信号特征，通过随机掩码和重建捕获时域特征。

Result: 在四个数据集上测试，RIS-MAE在少样本和跨域任务中表现优于现有方法，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RIS-MAE为AMC提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a basic technology in
intelligent wireless communication systems. It is important for tasks such as
spectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent
years, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However,
mainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use
time-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key
modulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication
conditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a
large amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments.
To solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called
RIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from
unlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking
and reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as
amplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable
representations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets. The results show that it
performs better than existing methods in few-shot and cross-domain tasks.
Notably, it achieves high classification accuracy on previously unseen datasets
with only a small number of fine-tuning samples, confirming its generalization
ability and potential for real-world deployment.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于RDARS的6G无线网络架构，通过联合优化基站和RDARS的波束成形矩阵以及RDARS的模式切换矩阵，最大化加权和速率（WSR）。采用PWM算法结合MM和WMMSE方法解决非凸优化问题，并引入模型驱动DL方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RDARS架构在6G网络中具有潜力，其动态工作模式配置相比RIS和DAS能带来额外选择增益，但优化问题复杂，需高效算法。

Method: 提出PWM算法结合MM和WMMSE方法，并集成模型驱动DL方法以加速收敛和提升性能。

Result: 仿真显示PWM-BFNet能减少一半迭代次数，在高发射功率和大RDARS传输单元场景下性能提升26.53%和103.2%。

Conclusion: PWM-BFNet算法有效解决了RDARS系统的优化问题，显著提升了系统性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is a
promising architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In
particular, the dynamic working mode configuration for the RDARS-aided system
brings an extra selection gain compared to the existing reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-aided system and distributed antenna system (DAS). In
this paper, we consider the RDARS-aided downlink multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) system and aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) by jointly
optimizing the beamforming matrices at the based station (BS) and RDARS, as
well as mode switching matrix at RDARS. The optimization problem is challenging
to be solved due to the non-convex objective function and mixed integer binary
constraint. To this end, a penalty term-based weight minimum mean square error
(PWM) algorithm is proposed by integrating the majorization-minimization (MM)
and weight minimum mean square error (WMMSE) methods. To further escape the
local optimum point in the PWM algorithm, a model-driven DL method is
integrated into this algorithm, where the key variables related to the
convergence of PWM algorithm are trained to accelerate the convergence speed
and improve the system performance. Simulation results are provided to show
that the PWM-based beamforming network (PWM-BFNet) can reduce the number of
iterations by half and achieve performance improvements of 26.53% and 103.2% at
the scenarios of high total transmit power and a large number of RDARS transmit
elements (TEs), respectively.

optimization-based algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the transmit
beamforming matrices, STAR-RIS configurations, and rate-splitting parameters.
STAR-RIS attains 360-degree full-plane coverage, while RSMA provides a
prominent gain by efficiently managing interference. Numerical results reveal a
strong synergy between RSMA and STAR-RIS, demonstreating significant EE gains
over reflective RIS and spatial division multiple access (SDMA).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实传播环境日益复杂和动态化，传统的基于实时信道状态信息（CSI）的方法计算成本高且准确性难以保证，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用VLM驱动的对比学习框架，通过模态特定编码器整合多模态数据，并使用对比预训练策略对齐图像和LiDAR特征。引入语言模态以增强跨模态一致性。

Result: 在DeepSense-6G数据集上的实验表明，该框架的DBA-Score达到0.9016，平均提升1.46%。

Conclusion: VLM驱动的多模态框架在复杂动态环境中表现出色，为毫米波波束预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As the real propagation environment becomes in creasingly complex and
dynamic, millimeter wave beam prediction faces huge challenges. However, the
powerful cross modal representation capability of vision-language model (VLM)
provides a promising approach. The traditional methods that rely on real-time
channel state information (CSI) are computationally expensive and often fail to
maintain accuracy in such environments. In this paper, we present a VLM-driven
contrastive learning based multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates
multimodal data via modality-specific encoders. To enforce cross-modal
consistency, we adopt a contrastive pretraining strategy to align image and
LiDAR features in the latent space. We use location information as text prompts
and connect it to the text encoder to introduce language modality, which
further improves cross-modal consistency. Experiments on the DeepSense-6G
dataset show that our VLM backbone provides additional semantic grounding.
Compared with existing methods, the overall distance-based accuracy score
(DBA-Score) of 0.9016, corresponding to 1.46% average improvement.

### [14] [Feasibility of Extracting Skin Nerve Activity from Electrocardiogram Recorded at A Low Sampling Frequency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00494)
*Youngsun Kong,Farnoush Baghestani,I-Ping Chen,Ki Chon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究表明，皮肤神经活动（SKNA）可以从低采样频率（如0.5 kHz或1 kHz）的ECG信号中提取，与传统高采样频率（4 kHz）相比无显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ECG设备采样频率通常较低（≤1 kHz），而SKNA提取通常需要更高采样频率（>2 kHz）。研究旨在验证低采样频率下SKNA提取的可行性。

Method: 收集16名参与者在交感神经刺激下的ECG信号，分别以0.5 kHz、1 kHz和4 kHz重采样，并进行统计分析。

Result: 统计分析显示，不同采样频率（0.5 kHz、1 kHz、4 kHz）下提取的SKNA指标无显著差异。

Conclusion: 传统低采样频率ECG设备可用于可靠提取SKNA，前提是肌肉伪影污染较小。

Abstract: Skin nerve activity (SKNA) derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has
been a promising non-invasive surrogate for accurate and effective assessment
of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Typically, SKNA extraction requires a
higher sampling frequency than the typical ECG recording requirement (> 2 kHz)
because analysis tools extract SKNA from the 0.5-1 kHz frequency band. However,
ECG recording systems commonly provide a sampling frequency of 1 kHz or lower,
particularly for wearable devices. Our recent power spectral analysis exhibited
that 150-500 Hz frequency bands are dominant during sympathetic stimulation.
Therefore, we hypothesize that SKNA can be extracted from ECG sampled at a
lower sampling frequency. We collected ECG signals from 16 participants during
SNS stimulation and resampled the signals at 0.5, 1, and 4 kHz. Our statistical
analyses of significance, classification performance, and reliability indicate
no significant difference between SKNA indices derived from ECG signals sampled
at 0.5, 1, and 4 kHz. Our findings indicate that conventional ECG devices,
which are limited to low sampling rates due to resource constraints or outdated
guidelines, can be used to reliably collect SKNA if muscle artifact
contamination is minimal.

Abstract: The feedforward selective fixed-filter method selects the most suitable
pre-trained control filter based on the spectral features of the detected
reference signal, effectively avoiding slow convergence in conventional
adaptive algorithms. However, it can only handle limited types of noises, and
the performance degrades when the input noise exhibits non-uniform power
spectral density. To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel
selective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the
off-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different
frequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database. During the
on-line control stage, the incoming noise is decomposed using a polyphase FFT
filter bank, and a frequency-band-matching mechanism assigns each subband
signal the most appropriate control filter. Subsequently, a weight stacking
technique is employed to combine all subband weights into a fullband filter,
enabling real-time noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme provides fast convergence, effective noise reduction, and
strong robustness in handling more complicated noisy environments.

Abstract: With its wide coverage and uninterrupted service, satellite communication is
a critical technology for next-generation 6G communications. High throughput
satellite (HTS) systems, utilizing multipoint beam and frequency multiplexing
techniques, enable satellite communication capacity of up to Tbps to meet the
growing traffic demand. Therefore, it is imperative to review
the-state-of-the-art of multibeam HTS systems and identify their associated
challenges and perspectives. Firstly, we summarize the multibeam HTS hardware
foundations, including ground station systems, on-board payloads, and user
terminals. Subsequently, we review the flexible on-board radio resource
allocation approaches of bandwidth, power, time slot, and joint allocation
schemes of HTS systems to optimize resource utilization and cater to
non-uniform service demand. Additionally, we survey multibeam precoding methods
for the HTS system to achieve full-frequency reuse and interference
cancellation, which are classified according to different deployments such as
single gateway precoding, multiple gateway precoding, on-board precoding, and
hybrid on-board/on-ground precoding. Finally, we disscuss the challenges
related to Q/V band link outage, time and frequency synchronization of
gateways, the accuracy of channel state information (CSI), payload light-weight
development, and the application of deep learning (DL). Research on these
topics will contribute to enhancing the performance of HTS systems and finally
delivering high-speed data to areas underserved by terrestrial networks.
