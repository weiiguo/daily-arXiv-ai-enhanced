This is the case of space\nTeleCommands (TCs), where coded data are usually preceded by a start sequence,\nand optionally followed by a tail sequence, forming the Communication Link\nTransmission Unit (CLTU). Regarding the choice of schemes for error correction,\nthe Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems recommendations for TC\nsynchronization and coding suggests to use, among others, two Low-Density\nParity-Check (LDPC) codes: one (relatively) long and one short. Adopting the\nlong LDPC code eliminates the need for a tail sequence, as the LDPC decoder\nalways fails when overrunning the end of the CLTU, thus causing the decoding\nand detection process to stop. This, however, is not true when the short LDPC\ncode is adopted, since its decoding might converge on a codeword even when the\ndecoder input is not a noisy codeword. This makes it necessary to use a tail\nsequence that causes the decoder to fail regardless of its input. In this\npaper, we study the features required for such a sequence and propose some\nmethods for its design. Our numerical results, obtained considering various\ndetection approaches for the tail sequence, show that the overall TC rejection\nprobability improves significantly when the proposed tail sequence is employed.\nOur simulations also show that, for moderate values of the Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (SNR), with a properly designed tail sequence it is possible to obtain\nthe same performance in terms of TC rejection probability using decoder-based\ndetection and likelihood ratio test-based detection, with the former approach\nbeing less complex than the latter."}

In this paper, we study the end-to-end optimization of\nDML-based systems based on a data-driven surrogate model trained on\nexperimental data. The end-to-end optimization includes the pulse shaping and\nequalizer filters, the bias current and the modulation radio-frequency (RF)\npower applied to the laser. The performance of the end-to-end optimization\nscheme is tested on the experimental setup and compared to 4 different\nbenchmark schemes based on linear and nonlinear receiver-side equalization. The\nresults show that the proposed end-to-end scheme is able to deliver better\nperformance throughout the studied symbol rates and transmission distances\nwhile employing lower modulation RF power, fewer filter taps and utilizing a\nsmaller signal bandwidth."}

Our proposed scheme remains\neffective even in the presence of active adversaries attempting impersonation\nattacks to disrupt the authentication process. Specifically, we introduce a\ntag-based PLA CFmMIMO system, wherein the access points (APs) first estimate\ntheir channels with the legitimate users during an uplink training phase.\nSubsequently, a unique secret key is generated and securely shared between each\nuser and the APs. We then formulate a hypothesis testing problem and derive a\nclosed-form expression for the probability of detection for each user in the\nnetwork. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,\ndemonstrating that it maintains a high detection probability even as the number\nof users in the system increases."}

To this end,\nthe outage regime for a multiuser multiple antenna system is studied within a\nrealistic geometry-based stochastic air-ground (AG) channel model. In this\napplication, users (aircraft) transmit air traffic management data to the\nground station at a predefined target rate. Due to the nature of the AG\npropagation, we argue that the relevant performance metric in this context is\nthe information outage probability. We consider the outage probability under\nthree decoding approaches. The first is based on successive interference\ncancellation (SIC). The second extends the first approach by considering joint\ngroup decoding. The third is a version of the second that limits the size of\nthe jointly decoded user groups in order to lower the decoding complexity. The\nresults show that joint group decoding, even in groups of only two, can\nsignificantly increase the spectral efficiency in the AG channel by allowing a\nlarge number of aircraft to transmit over a non-orthogonal channel with very\nlow outage probabilities."}
