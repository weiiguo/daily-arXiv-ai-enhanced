The network is modeled as a directed acyclic graph. A sink node wishes to compute a function of messages generated by multiple distributed sources, while an eavesdropper can access exactly one wiretap set from a given collection. The eavesdropper must be prevented from obtaining any information about a specified security function of the source messages. The secure computing capacity is the maximum average number of times that the target function can be securely computed with zero error at the sink node with the given collection of wiretap sets and security function for one use of the network. We establish two upper bounds on this capacity, which hold for arbitrary network topologies and for any vector linear target and security functions. These bounds generalize existing results and also lead to a new upper bound when the target function is the sum over a finite field. For the lower bound, when the target function is the sum, we extend an existing method, which transforms a non-secure network code into a secure one, to the case where the security function is vector linear. Furthermore, for a particular class of networks and a vector linear target function, we characterize the required properties of the global encoding matrix to construct a secure vector linear network code."}

The multicasting problem is solved by leveraging minorization-maximization (MM) principle to yield a provably convergent algorithm. In each run of the MM based procedure, we solve a convex surrogate problem using two methods called the candidate search method (CSM) and the bisection search method (BSM). With both BSM and CSM, we not only report superior performance of the multicasting PASS in non-LoS environments compared to conventional antenna systems (CAS), but also determine that BSM yields better overall computational complexity when the number of users and PAs increases. For example, we report that when we have 8 PAs and 25 users, the execution time with the CSM is approximately 2.5 times that with the BSM."}

In particular, frequency sharing between the HAPS satellite uplink and HAPS ground downlink improves spectrum efficiency but suffers from interference caused by the HAPS antenna back-lobe. Existing approaches relying on zero-forcing (ZF) codebooks have limited performance under highly dynamic channel conditions. To overcome this limitation, we employ a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided HAPS-based SAGIN framework with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm.

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets.

Building on Streamlet's streamlined structure, we introduce a \\textit{Channel-Aware Leader Election (CALE)} mechanism. CALE serves as a verifiable cross-layer cognitive engine that leverages receiver-measured channel state information (CSI) piggybacked in signed votes to derive Byzantine-robust connectivity scores from notarization certificates, and deterministically selects a unique weighted leader per epoch from finalized history, thereby improving proposal dissemination reliability under deep fading. Complementing this cognitive adaptation, Wireless Streamlet exploits the single-hop broadcast medium and a deterministic TDMA voting schedule to achieve linear per-epoch on-air transmissions (slot complexity), ensuring deterministic spectral access. To address the communication-storage trade-off, we further propose a coded dual-chain architecture that decouples header-only consensus (State Chain) from payload data (Data Chain). By employing erasure coding and on-chain integrity commitments, the system minimizes redundant spectrum usage for data retrieval while ensuring availability. Experiments show that Wireless Streamlet achieves higher throughput and lower confirmation latency than representative baselines in lossy environments, while substantially reducing per-node storage, demonstrating the efficacy of integrating cognitive sensing into consensus logic."}

However, the academic community has long lacked a predictive method connecting underlying topology to high-level service fairness. To bridge this gap, this paper analyzes a QoE imbalance index ($I$) through the lens of spectral graph theory.Our core contribution is the proof of a novel exponential spectral upper bound. This bound reveals that the improvement of QoE fairness exhibits an exponential decay behavior only above a performance threshold determined jointly by network size and connectivity. Its core decay rate is dominated by the weaker of two factors: the SLA stringency ($a$) and the network's spectral gap ($cλ_2$). The upper bound unifies the service protocol and the topological bottleneck within a single performance bound formula for the first time.This theoretical relationship also reveals a clear bottleneck effect, where the system's fairness ceiling is determined by the weaker link between service parameters and network structure. This finding provides a bottleneck-driven principle for resource optimization in network design and enables goal-driven reverse engineering. Extensive numerical experiments on various random graph models and real-world network topologies robustly validate the correctness and universality of our analytical framework."}

By identifying the underlying stochastic transport mechanism as a Gaussian variance-mixture, we introduce and analyze the Normally-Drifted First-Hitting Location (NDFHL) family as a geometry-driven model for boundary-induced noise. Under a second-moment constraint, we derive an exact high-SNR capacity expansion and show that the asymptotic upper and lower bounds coincide at the constant level, yielding a vanishing capacity gap. As a consequence, isotropic Gaussian signaling is asymptotically capacity-achieving for all fixed drift strengths, despite the non-Gaussian and semi-heavy-tailed nature of the noise. The pre-log factor is determined solely by the dimension of the receiving boundary, revealing a geometric origin of the channel's degrees of freedom. The refined expansion further uncovers an entropy-dominant universality, whereby all physical parameters of the transport process -- including drift strength, diffusion coefficient, and boundary separation -- affect the capacity only through the differential entropy of the induced noise. Although the NDFHL density does not admit a simple closed form, its entropy is shown to be finite and to vary continuously as the drift vanishes, thereby connecting the finite-variance regime with the singular infinite-variance Cauchy limit. Together, these results provide a unified geometric and information-theoretic characterization of boundary-hitting channels across both regular and singular transport regimes."}

We propose two complementary architectures: DeepVLF-R, where termination is receiver-driven, and DeepVLF-T, where the transmitter controls termination. Both architectures leverage bit-group partitioning and transformer-based encoder-decoder networks to enable fine-grained rate adaptation in response to feedback. Evaluations over AWGN and 5G-NR fading channels demonstrate that DeepVLF substantially outperforms state-of-the-art learned feedback codes. It achieves the same block error rate with 20%-55% fewer channel uses and lowers error floors by orders of magnitude, particularly in high-rate regimes.

While this structure theoretically enables accurate channel estimation by sampling the response from one pilot symbol, practical implementation is constrained by the spreading of effective channel response induced by pulse shaping filters. To address this, we first derive the I/O relationship for discrete-time oversampled Zak-OTFS, which closely approximates the continuous-time system and facilitates analysis and numerical simulation. We show that every delay-Doppler domain symbol undergoes the same effective channel response under the discrete oversampled Zak-OTFS. We then analyze the impact of window ambiguity functions, and reveal that high sidelobes lead to wide channel spreading and degrade estimation accuracy. Building on this insight, we propose a novel pulse shaping filter design that synthesizes Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs) within the Isotropic Orthogonal Transform Algorithm (IOTA) framework.

Numerous methods have been proposed to jointly optimize key performance metrics such as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and Cramér-Rao bound. However, the computational complexity of these methods often grows rapidly with the number of transmit antennas at the base station (BS). To tackle this challenge, we prove a fundamental structural property of the ISAC beamforming problem, i.e., there exists an optimal solution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure. This leads to an equivalent reformulation of the problem with dimension related to the number of users rather than the number of BS antennas, thereby enabling the development of low-complexity algorithms. When applying the interior-point method to the reformulated problem, we achieve up to six orders of magnitude in complexity reduction when the number of antennas exceeds the number of users by an order of magnitude. To further reduce the complexity, we develop a balanced augmented Lagrangian method to solve the reformulated problem. The proposed algorithm maintains optimality while achieving a computational complexity that scales quartically with the number of users.

This paper addresses the fundamental question: Can arbitrary electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) arrays achieve unambiguous reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided localization when element spacing exceeds $λ/2$? We provide an affirmative answer by exploiting the multi-component structure of EMVS measurements and developing a synergistic estimation and optimization framework for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bistatic multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. A third-order parallel factor (PARAFAC) model is constructed from EMVS observations, enabling natural separation of spatial, polarimetric, and propagation effects via the trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) algorithm. A novel phase-disambiguation procedure leverages rotational invariance across the six electromagnetic components of EMVSs to resolve $2π$ phase wrapping in arbitrary array geometries, allowing unambiguous joint estimation of two-dimensional (2-D) direction of departure (DOD), two-dimensional direction of arrival (DOA), and polarization parameters with automatic pairing. To support localization in NLOS environments and enhance estimation robustness, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is incorporated and its phase shifts are optimized via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to maximize received signal power, improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and further suppressing spatial ambiguities through iterative refinement."}

Moreover, we aim to reveal if it is desirable to have similar probability distributions for the target and user locations in terms of the ISAC performance. Firstly, based on only probability distribution information, we establish communication and sensing performance metrics via deriving the expected rate or posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB). Then, we formulate the transmit beamforming optimization problem to minimize the PCRB subject to the expected rate constraint, for which the optimal solution is derived. It is unveiled that the rank of the optimal transmit covariance matrix is upper bounded by the summation of MIMO communication channel matrices for all possible user locations. Furthermore, due to the need to cater to multiple target/user locations, we investigate whether dynamically employing different beamforming designs over different time slots improves the performance. It is proven that using a static beamforming strategy is sufficient for achieving the optimal performance. Numerical results validate our analysis, show that ISAC performance improves as the target/user location distributions become similar, and provide useful insights on the BS-user/-target association strategy."}

We present the Local Damage Mode Extractor (LDME), a structured, physics-informed signal processing framework that combines dual-path denoising, multiscale decomposition, fractional-domain enhancement, and statistically principled anomaly scoring to produce interpretable condition indicators without supervision. LDME is organized in three layers: (i) dual-path denoising (DWT with adaptive Savitzky-Golay smoothing) to suppress broadband noise while preserving transient fault structure; (ii) multi-scale damage enhancement using a Teager-Kaiser pre-amplifier followed by a Hadamard-Caputo fractional operator that accentuates non-sinusoidal, low-frequency fault signatures; and (iii) decision fusion, where harmonics-aware Fourier indicators are combined and scored by an unsupervised anomaly detector. Evaluation using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, the HUMS 2023 planetary gearbox benchmark, and a controlled simulated dataset shows that LDME consistently distinguishes nominal, early-crack, and propagated-crack stages under various operating conditions. LDME identifies the primary detection event earlier (198 cycles) than HT-TSA (284 cycles) and advances maintenance recommendation time from 383 to 365 cycles.

This paper introduces hierarchical subcode ensemble decoding (HSCED), a new ensemble decoding framework that expands the number of constituent decoders while still guaranteeing linear covering. The key idea is to recursively generate subcode parity constraints in a hierarchical structure so that coverage is maintained at every level, enabling large ensembles with controlled complexity. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply HSCED to belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes, where dense parity-check matrices induce severe stopping-set effects that limit conventional BP. Simulations confirm that HSCED delivers significant block-error-rate improvements over standard BP and conventional subcode-ensemble decoding under the same decoding-latency constraint."}

Conventional end-to-end algorithms couple CKM prior information with task- and device-specific observations, and require labeled data and separate training for each construction configuration, which is expensive and therefore incompatible with scalable edge deployments. Motivated by the trends toward cloud-edge collaboration and the Artificial Intelligence - Radio Access Network (AI-RAN) paradigm, we develop a cloud-edge collaborative framework for scalable CKM construction, which enables knowledge sharing across tasks, devices, and regions by explicitly decoupling a generalizable CKM prior from the information provided by local observations. A foundation model is trained once in the cloud using unlabeled data to learn a generalizable CKM prior. During inference, edge nodes combine the shared prior with local observations. Experiments on the CKMImageNet dataset show that the proposed method achieves competitive construction accuracy while substantially reducing training cost and data requirements, mitigating negative transfer, and offering clear advantages in generalization and deployment scalability."}

This article presents affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) as a premier candidate for 6G, offering intrinsic robustness for both high-mobility communications and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in doubly dispersive channels, while maintaining a high degree of synergy with the legacy OFDM. To this end, we provide a comprehensive analysis of AFDM, starting with a generalized fractional-delay-fractional-Doppler (FDFD) channel model that accounts for practical pulse shaping filters and inter-sample coupling. We then detail the AFDM transceiver architecture, demonstrating that it reuses nearly the entire OFDM pipeline and requires only lightweight digital pre- and post-processing. We also analyze the impact of hardware impairments, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, and explore advanced functionalities enabled by the chirp-parameter domain, including index modulation and physical-layer security. By evaluating the reusability across the radio-frequency, physical, and higher layers, the article demonstrates that AFDM provides a low-risk, feature-rich, and efficient path toward achieving high-fidelity communications in the later versions of 6G and beyond (6G+)."}

In contrast to prior studies that assume a fixed SF channel, we note that the SF channel is configurable, as its characteristics are shaped by various transmission and reception strategies, such as power allocation. Based on this observation, we formulate the SF channel optimization problem under a mutual information constraint between the SFs and their reconstructions, and analytically derive the optimal SF channel under a linear encoder-decoder structure and Gaussian source assumption. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a joint optimization framework for the encoder-decoder and SF channel, applicable to both analog and digital SCs.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel structured beam communication framework exploiting movable antennas (MAs) to achieve reconfigurable array topologies. Specifically, we develop an MA-based geometric modeling framework to construct a variety of practical array topologies, thereby enabling the realization of diverse array configurations utilizing a unified hardware platform. Furthermore, we investigate the joint design of the array topology and the structured beamforming vector to efficiently exploit the array aperture and facilitate the multiplexing of orthogonal spatial modes. Accordingly, we formulate the corresponding beam generation and demodulation schemes and derive the channel gains under varying array topologies. We also propose an alternating optimization algorithm to jointly optimize the array topology configuration, the antenna element positions, and the structured beamforming vector, with the aim of maximizing the system SE. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint design significantly enhances the SE compared to conventional FPA schemes. By synergizing the spatial multiplexing degrees of freedom (DoFs) of structured beams with the mobility DoFs of MAs within 2D planar regions, this work establishes a reconfigurable and practical framework for structured beam-based wireless communications."}

However, these features are inevitably obscured by noise, leading to uncertainty in estimating both signal levels and transition points. Traditional frequency-domain filtering is ineffective for denoising stepwise signals, as edge-related high-frequency components strongly overlap with noise. Although Hidden Markov Model-based approaches are widely used, they rely on stationarity assumptions and are not specifically designed for signal denoising. Here, we propose a diffusion model-based algorithm for stepwise signal denoising, named the Stepwise Signal Diffusion Model (SSDM). During training, SSDM learns the statistical structure of stepwise signals via a forward diffusion process that progressively adds noise. In the following reverse process, the model reconstructs clean signals from noisy observations, integrating a multi-scale convolutional network with an attention mechanism. Training data are generated by simulating stepwise signals through a Markov process with additive Gaussian noise. Across a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, SSDM consistently outperforms traditional methods in both signal level reconstruction and transition point detection. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated on experimental data from single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and nanopore DNA translocation measurements. Overall, SSDM provides a general and robust framework for recovering stepwise signals in various single-molecule detections and other physical systems exhibiting discrete state transitions."}

Moreover, we aim to reveal if it is desirable to have similar probability distributions for the target and user locations in terms of the ISAC performance. Firstly, based on only probability distribution information, we establish communication and sensing performance metrics via deriving the expected rate or posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB). Then, we formulate the transmit beamforming optimization problem to minimize the PCRB subject to the expected rate constraint, for which the optimal solution is derived. It is unveiled that the rank of the optimal transmit covariance matrix is upper bounded by the summation of MIMO communication channel matrices for all possible user locations. Furthermore, due to the need to cater to multiple target/user locations, we investigate whether dynamically employing different beamforming designs over different time slots improves the performance. It is proven that using a static beamforming strategy is sufficient for achieving the optimal performance. Numerical results validate our analysis, show that ISAC performance improves as the target/user location distributions become similar, and provide useful insights on the BS-user/-target association strategy."}

Achieving strong diversity gains, however, requires constructing many subcodes that satisfy a linear covering property-yet existing approaches lack a systematic way to scale the ensemble size while preserving this property. This paper introduces hierarchical subcode ensemble decoding (HSCED), a new ensemble decoding framework that expands the number of constituent decoders while still guaranteeing linear covering. The key idea is to recursively generate subcode parity constraints in a hierarchical structure so that coverage is maintained at every level, enabling large ensembles with controlled complexity. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply HSCED to belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes, where dense parity-check matrices induce severe stopping-set effects that limit conventional BP. Simulations confirm that HSCED delivers significant block-error-rate improvements over standard BP and conventional subcode-ensemble decoding under the same decoding-latency constraint."}

This paper proposes a two-stage near-ML decoding framework that applies to any linear block code. In the first stage, we run a low-complexity decoder to produce a candidate codeword and a cyclic redundancy check. When this stage succeeds, we terminate immediately. When it fails, we invoke a second-stage decoder, termed multipoint code-weight sphere decoding (MP-WSD). The central idea behind {MP-WSD} is to concentrate the ML search where it matters. We pre-compute a set of low-weight codewords and use them to generate structured local perturbations of the current estimate. Starting from the first-stage output, MP-WSD iteratively explores a small Euclidean sphere of candidate codewords formed by adding selected low-weight codewords, tightening the search region as better candidates are found. This design keeps the average complexity low: at high signal-to-noise ratio, the first stage succeeds with high probability and the second stage is rarely activated; when it is activated, the search remains localized. Simulation results show that the proposed decoder attains near-ML performance for short-blocklength, low-rate codes while maintaining low decoding latency."}
