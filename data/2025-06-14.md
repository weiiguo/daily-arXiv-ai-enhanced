### [1] [A Survey of Data Compression Algorithms and their Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10000)
*Mohammad Hosseini*

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着信息存储和数据传输需求的增长，数据压缩技术变得愈发重要，尤其是在网络传输和存储资源有限的情况下。

Method: 论文通过综述的方式，详细讨论了一些重要的数据压缩算法，并对其性能进行了评估。

Result: 数据压缩技术可以有效节省存储空间和带宽，减少下载时间。

Conclusion: 数据压缩技术在当前和未来的信息处理中具有重要价值，需要进一步研究和优化。

Abstract: Today, with the growing demands of information storage and data transfer,
data compression is becoming increasingly important. Data Compression is a
technique which is used to decrease the size of data. This is very useful when
some huge files have to be transferred over networks or being stored on a data
storage device and the size is more than the capacity of the data storage or
would consume so much bandwidth for transmission in a network. With the advent
of the Internet and mobile devices with limited resources, data compression has
gained even more importance. It can be effectively used to save both storage
and bandwidth, thus to decrease download duration. Data compression can be
achieved by a host of techniques. During this survey, I'm going to thoroughly
discuss some of important data compression algorithms, their performance
evaluation, and their major applications along with today's issues and recent
research approaches.

### [2] [HiKO: A Hierarchical Framework for Beyond-Second-Order KO Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10121)
*Shubham Srivastava,Adrish Banerjee*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: HiKO框架通过分层训练、改进神经架构和渐进解冻策略，首次将KO码扩展到二阶以上，性能超越Reed-Muller码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KO码在高码率下性能下降，限制了实际应用。HiKO旨在解决这一问题，扩展KO码的应用范围。

Method: 1. 分层训练分解复杂高码率码；2. 改进神经架构（如Dropout和可学习跳跃连接）；3. 渐进解冻策略优化预训练组件。

Result: HiKO码在三阶和四阶码率下性能优于Reed-Muller码，接近Shannon最优高斯码本。

Conclusion: HiKO首次成功扩展KO码至二阶以上，为高吞吐通信系统提供了新可能。

Abstract: This paper introduces HiKO (Hierarchical Kronecker Operation), a novel
framework for training high-rate neural error-correcting codes that enables KO
codes to outperform Reed-Muller codes beyond second order. To our knowledge,
this is the first attempt to extend KO codes beyond second order. While
conventional KO codes show promising results for low-rate regimes ($r < 2$),
they degrade at higher rates -- a critical limitation for practical deployment.
Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical training
methodology that decomposes complex high-rate codes into simpler constituent
codes for efficient knowledge transfer, (2) enhanced neural architectures with
dropout regularization and learnable skip connections tailored for the Plotkin
structure, and (3) a progressive unfreezing strategy that systematically
transitions from pre-trained components to fully optimized integrated codes.
Our experiments show that HiKO codes consistently outperform traditional
Reed-Muller codes across various configurations, achieving notable performance
improvements for third-order ($r = 3$) and fourth-order ($r = 4$) codes.
Analysis reveals that HiKO codes successfully approximate Shannon-optimal
Gaussian codebooks while preserving efficient decoding properties. This
represents the first successful extension of KO codes beyond second order,
opening new possibilities for neural code deployment in high-throughput
communication systems.

### [3] [DeepPolar+: Breaking the BER-BLER Trade-off with Self-Attention and SMART (SNR-MAtched Redundancy Technique) decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10166)
*Shubham Srivastava,Adrish Banerjee*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: DeepPolar+是一种改进的神经极化编码框架，通过注意力增强解码器、结构化损失函数和自适应SNR匹配冗余技术，同时提升BER和BLER性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DeepPolar码在BER性能优越但BLER性能不足的问题，消除BER-BLER权衡，推动神经极化码的实际应用。

Method: 采用注意力增强解码器、结构化损失函数和自适应SNR匹配冗余技术（DP+SMART解码器）。

Result: 在(256,37)码配置下，DeepPolar+在BER和BLER性能上均优于传统方法和DeepPolar码，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: DeepPolar+填补了神经极化码理论与实际应用的差距，为下一代纠错系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: DeepPolar codes have recently emerged as a promising approach for channel
coding, demonstrating superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to
conventional polar codes. Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these
codes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a
fundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment
in communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural
polar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off
by simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER
characteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough
through three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture
that leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex
dependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly
optimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an
adaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code
(DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for
robust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code
configuration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and
BLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and
DeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved
architecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further
amplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error
rate metrics over existing approaches. DeepPolar+ effectively bridges the gap
between theoretical potential and practical implementation of neural polar
codes, offering a viable path forward for next-generation error correction
systems.

### [5] [Optimal Non-Adaptive Group Testing with One-Sided Error Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10374)
*Daniel McMorrow,Jonathan Scarlett*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了近似恢复条件下的群组测试问题，允许少量误分类。在一侧近似恢复（仅允许假阴性或假阳性）下，证明了算法的优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决群组测试中稀疏缺陷集的近似恢复问题，放宽恢复标准以允许少量误分类。

Method: 研究一侧近似恢复标准（仅假阴性或假阳性），分析现有算法的性能。

Result: 在仅假阴性条件下，存在算法匹配双侧近似恢复的最优阈值；在仅假阳性条件下，证明现有算法的最优性。

Conclusion: 一侧近似恢复在群组测试中具有优化性能，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The group testing problem consists of determining a sparse subset of
defective items from within a larger set of items via a series of tests, where
each test outcome indicates whether at least one defective item is included in
the test. We study the approximate recovery setting, where the recovery
criterion of the defective set is relaxed to allow a small number of items to
be misclassified. In particular, we consider one-sided approximate recovery
criteria, where we allow either only false negative or only false positive
misclassifications. Under false negatives only (i.e., finding a subset of
defectives), we show that there exists an algorithm matching the optimal
threshold of two-sided approximate recovery. Under false positives only (i.e.,
finding a superset of the defectives), we provide a converse bound showing that
the better of two existing algorithms is optimal.

Abstract: This paper investigates the algebraic structure of additive complementary
pairs of cyclic codes over a finite commutative ring. We demonstrate that for
every additive complementary pair of additive cyclic codes, both constituent
codes are free modules. Moreover, we present a necessary and sufficient
condition for a pair of additive cyclic codes over a finite commutative ring to
form an additive complementary pair. Finally, we construct a complementary pair
of additive cyclic codes over a finite chain ring and show that one of the
codes is permutation equivalent to the trace dual of the other.

### [7] [Downlink CSIT under Compressed Feedback: Joint vs. Separate Source-Channel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10554)
*Yi Song,Tianyu Yang,Mahdi Barzegar Khalilsarai,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了在多用户大规模MIMO系统中下行链路信道状态信息（CSIT）获取的挑战，提出了一种基于联合源信道编码（JSCC）的反馈方案，优化了性能并接近理论下限。


<details>

Motivation: 在多用户大规模MIMO系统中，当上下行信道互易性不成立时，获取下行链路CSIT具有挑战性。论文旨在通过优化反馈方案提高信道估计性能。

Method: 论文首先利用远程失真率理论提供了JSCC和SSCC反馈方案的理论下限，随后提出了一种基于JSCC的实用反馈方案，优化了特征空间中的维度投影。

Result: 提出的JSCC方案在性能上优于已知的JSCC、SSCC基准和基于深度学习的方案，并在实际SNR范围内接近最优DR方案的性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的JSCC反馈方案在多用户大规模MIMO系统中显著提升了CSIT获取的性能，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The acquisition of Downlink (DL) channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT) is known to be a challenging task in multiuser massive MIMO systems when
uplink/downlink channel reciprocity does not hold (e.g., in frequency division
duplexing systems). From a coding viewpoint, the DL channel state acquired at
the users via DL training can be seen as an information source that must be
conveyed to the base station via the UL communication channels. The
transmission of a source through a channel can be accomplished either by
separate or joint source-channel coding (SSCC or JSCC). In this work, using
classical remote distortion-rate (DR) theory, we first provide a theoretical
lower bound on the channel estimation mean-square-error (MSE) of both JSCC and
SSCC-based feedback schemes, which however requires encoding of large blocks of
successive channel states and thus cannot be used in practicesince it would
incur in an extremely large feedback delay. We then focus on the relevant case
of minimal (one slot) feedback delay and propose a practical JSCC-based
feedback scheme that fully exploits the channel second-order statistics to
optimize the dimension projection in the eigenspace. We analyze the large SNR
behavior of the proposed JSCC-based scheme in terms of the quality scaling
exponent (QSE). Given the second-order statistics of channel estimation of any
feedback scheme, we further derive the closed-form of the lower bound to the
ergodic sum-rate for DL data transmission under maximum ratio transmission and
zero-forcing precoding. Via extensive numerical results, we show that our
proposed JSCC-based scheme outperforms known JSCC, SSCC baseline and deep
learning-based schemes and is able to approach the performance of the optimal
DR scheme in the range of practical SNR.

### [8] [Anomaly Detection for Sensing Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10718)
*Stefan Roth,Aydin Sezgin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了物理层安全中的异常检测方法，提出了基于移动平均、自回归和卡尔曼滤波的轻量级算法，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究物理层安全中的异常检测需求，包括轻量计算、环境适应性和抗相位噪声。

Method: 采用移动平均、自回归和卡尔曼滤波预测特征向量，并设计假设测试进行异常检测。

Result: 案例研究表明，算法与信道特征组合能有效检测攻击者的运动行为，但仅依赖发射功率随机化的对策不足。

Conclusion: 建议采用频率变化的随机化措施以增强安全性。

Abstract: Various approaches in the field of physical layer security involve anomaly
detection, such as physical layer authentication, sensing attacks, and
anti-tampering solutions. Depending on the context in which these approaches
are applied, anomaly detection needs to be computationally lightweight,
resilient to changes in temperature and environment, and robust against phase
noise. We adapt moving average filters, autoregression filters and Kalman
filters to provide predictions of feature vectors that fulfill the above
criteria. Different hypothesis test designs are employed that allow
omnidirectional and unidirectional outlier detection. In a case study, a
sensing attack is investigated that employs the described algorithms with
various channel features based on commodity WiFi devices. Thereby, various
combinations of algorithms and channel features show effectiveness for motion
detection by an attacker. Countermeasures only utilizing transmit power
randomization are shown insufficient to mitigate such attacks if the attacker
has access to channel state information (CSI) measurements, suggesting that
mitigation solutions might require frequency-variant randomization.

### [9] [Deep Semantic Segmentation for Multi-Source Localization Using Angle of Arrival Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10107)
*Mustafa Atahan Nuhoglu,Hakan Ali Cirpan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，利用语义分割模型（UNet和UNetPP）解决动态环境中的多源定位问题，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于单源定位，动态环境中的多源定位研究不足，需填补这一空白。

Method: 使用UNet和UNetPP模型，通过分析运动平台的位置和方向测量线的交点，实现多源定位。

Result: 在单源定位中与传统方法相当，但在高噪声和多源条件下仍能准确定位。

Conclusion: 深度学习框架在多源定位中表现优异，尤其在复杂环境下具有优势。

Abstract: This paper presents a solution for multi source localization using only angle
of arrival measurements. The receiver platform is in motion, while the sources
are assumed to be stationary. Although numerous methods exist for single source
localization, many relying on pseudo-linear formulations or non convex
optimization techniques, there remains a significant gap in research addressing
multi source localization in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we
propose a deep learning-based framework that leverages semantic segmentation
models for multi source localization. Specifically, we employ UNet and UNetPP
as backbone models, processing input images that encode the platform's
positions along with the corresponding direction finding lines at each
position. By analyzing the intersections of these lines, the models effectively
identify and localize multiple sources. Through simulations, we evaluate both
single- and multi-source localization scenarios. Our results demonstrate that
while the proposed approach performs comparably to traditional methods in
single source localization, it achieves accurate source localization even in
challenging conditions with high noise levels and an increased number of
sources.

### [10] [Quantifying Data Requirements for EEG Independent Component Analysis Using AMICA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10156)
*Gwenevere Frank,Seyed Yahya Shirazi,Jason Palmer,Gert Cauwenberghs,Scott Makeig,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了数据量与通道数对ICA分解质量的影响，发现增加数据量能持续提升分解质量，未观察到明确的平台期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨数据量与通道数对ICA分解质量的影响，以优化EEG数据处理。

Method: 使用AMICA算法对71通道数据集进行分解，随机子采样数据以模拟不同数据量，评估MIR和近偶极性。

Result: 增加数据量能持续提升MIR和近偶极性，未发现平台期。

Conclusion: 收集更多EEG数据可能持续提升分解质量，超越常见启发式阈值。

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing
for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed
studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies
have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced
by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters
for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against
which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity
versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA
decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly
subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a
dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the
varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR)
and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend
can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near
dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was
observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may
extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition
quality.

### [11] [Intelligent Travel Activity Monitoring: Generalized Distributed Acoustic Sensing Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10237)
*Ruikang Zhong,Chia-Yen Chiang,Mona Jaber,Rupert De Wilde,Peter Hayward*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的分布式声学传感（DAS）系统，用于监测步行和骑行活动，解决了隐私问题，并通过联邦学习和元学习提高了系统的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取步行、慢跑和骑行等主动出行活动的数据对优化可持续交通系统（STS）至关重要，同时需要兼顾准确性、经济性和隐私保护。

Method: 利用DAS捕捉环境振动，通过深度学习推断运动模式；提出基于联邦学习的IoT方案和基于元学习的离线初始化方法，以应对不同部署环境的泛化挑战。

Result: 在步行和骑行分类实验中，系统表现出良好的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该DL增强的DAS系统为大规模主动出行监测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Obtaining data on active travel activities such as walking, jogging, and
cycling is important for refining sustainable transportation systems (STS).
Effectively monitoring these activities not only requires sensing solutions to
have a joint feature of being accurate, economical, and privacy-preserving, but
also enough generalizability to adapt to different climate environments and
deployment conditions. In order to provide a generalized sensing solution, a
deep learning (DL)-enhanced distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system for
monitoring active travel activities is proposed. By leveraging the ambient
vibrations captured by DAS, this scheme infers motion patterns without relying
on image-based or wearable devices, thereby addressing privacy concerns. We
conduct real-world experiments in two geographically distinct locations and
collect comprehensive datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed
system. To address the generalization challenges posed by heterogeneous
deployment environments, we propose two solutions according to network
availability: 1) an Internet-of-Things (IoT) scheme based on federated learning
(FL) is proposed, and it enables geographically different DAS nodes to be
trained collaboratively to improve generalizability; 2) an off-line
initialization approach enabled by meta-learning is proposed to develop
high-generality initialization for DL models and to enable rapid model
fine-tuning with limited data samples, facilitating generalization at newly
established or isolated DAS nodes. Experimental results of the walking and
cycling classification problem demonstrate the performance and generalizability
of the proposed DL-enhanced DAS system, paving the way for practical,
large-scale DAS monitoring of active travel.

### [12] [Ground Reaction Force Estimation via Time-aware Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10265)
*Eun Som Jeon,Sinjini Mitra,Jisoo Lee,Omik M. Save,Ankita Shukla,Hyunglae Lee,Pavan Turaga*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间感知知识蒸馏的框架，用于从鞋垫传感器数据中估计地面反作用力（GRF），解决了便携式传感器噪声和精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便携式鞋垫传感器在GRF测量中存在噪声和精度不足的问题，而传统跑步机测量设备昂贵且不便携。

Method: 采用时间感知知识蒸馏框架，利用小批次内的相似性和时序特征，捕捉目标与输入数据间的互补关系和时序特性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在GRF估计上优于现有基线，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 时间感知知识蒸馏框架为便携式GRF测量提供了一种高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种异构智能反射面（HE-IRS），结合动态可调元件（DTEs）和静态可调元件（STEs），以平衡性能和功耗。研究了HE-IRS辅助多用户MIMO系统中的信道估计和波束成形问题，提出了高效的信道估计方案和波束成形算法。

Motivation: 传统IRS因大量反射元件和控制电路导致功耗问题，HE-IRS通过结合DTEs和STEs来解决这一问题，但引入了信道估计和波束成形的新挑战。

Method: 将HE-IRS信道分解为DTE级联信道和STE等效信道，利用稀疏性和流形优化提出高效信道估计方案；开发鲁棒秩选择规则解决稀疏信息不匹配问题；提出离线和在线波束成形算法。

Result: 仿真表明，HE-IRS在相同元件数量下比传统IRS需要更少的导频开销，且通过提出的方案实现了竞争性的总速率性能和显著降低的功耗。

Conclusion: HE-IRS是一种绿色解决方案，通过优化信道估计和波束成形，在性能和功耗之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has gained great attention for its
ability to create favorable propagation environments. However, the power
consumption of conventional IRSs cannot be ignored due to the large number of
reflecting elements and control circuits. To balance performance and power
consumption, we previously proposed a heterogeneous-IRS (HE-IRS), a green IRS
structure integrating dynamically tunable elements (DTEs) and statically
tunable elements (STEs). Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the
unique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel
estimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel
estimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel
estimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated
is decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent
channel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based
channels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation
scheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity
information, a robust rank selection rule is developed. For beamforming, we
propose an offline algorithm to optimize the STE phase shifts for wide beam
coverage, and an online algorithm to optimize the BS precoder and the DTE phase
shifts using the estimated HE-IRS channel. Simulation results show that the
HE-IRS requires less pilot overhead than conventional IRSs with the same number
of elements. With the proposed channel estimation and beamforming schemes, the
green HE-IRS achieves competitive sum rate performance with significantly
reduced power consumption.

*Yeqing Qiu,Chengpiao Huang,Ye Xue,Zhipeng Jiang,Qingjiang Shi,Dong Zhang,Zhi-Quan Luo*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于中国剩余定理（CRT）的PCI分配框架，通过分解问题和优化算法显著提高了5G网络的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决5G网络中PCI分配导致的mod-3和mod-30干扰、碰撞和混淆问题，提升网络可靠性和用户体验。

Result: 在真实数据集上，计算时间减少20倍，显著降低干扰并消除碰撞和混淆。

Conclusion: 该方法在5G网络中具有高效性和可扩展性，能显著提升网络性能并降低部署成本。

Abstract: Physical Cell Identity (PCI) is a critical parameter in 5G networks.
Efficient and accurate PCI assignment is essential for mitigating mod-3
interference, mod-30 interference, collisions, and confusions among cells,
which directly affect network reliability and user experience. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework for PCI assignment by decomposing the problem into
Min-3-Partition, Min-10-Partition, and a graph coloring problem, leveraging the
Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Furthermore, we develop a relaxation-free
approach to the general Min-$k$-Partition problem by reformulating it as a
quadratic program with a norm-equality constraint and solving it using a
penalized mirror descent (PMD) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates
superior computational efficiency and scalability, significantly reducing
interference while eliminating collisions and confusions in large-scale 5G
networks. Numerical evaluations on real-world datasets show that our approach
reduces computational time by up to 20 times compared to state-of-the-art
methods, making it highly practical for real-time PCI optimization in
large-scale networks. These results highlight the potential of our method to
improve network performance and reduce deployment costs in modern 5G systems.

### [15] [A Neural Network-aided Low Complexity Chase Decoder for URLLC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10513)
*Enrico Testi,Enrico Paolini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合神经网络预测的增强型Chase-II解码算法，以在URLLC中实现高性能和低复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: URLLC需要高可靠性和低复杂度的解码算法，但现有方法在短块长度下性能不足或计算成本过高。

Method: 利用神经网络预测扰动模式，减少解码尝试次数，结合准最大似然解码的可靠性和神经网络的高效性。

Result: 提出的方法显著减少了所需的解码尝试次数，同时保持了高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法适合时间敏感和资源受限的URLLC应用，平衡了性能和复杂度。

Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand decoding algorithms
that simultaneously offer high reliability and low complexity under stringent
latency constraints. While iterative decoding schemes for LDPC and Polar codes
offer a good compromise between performance and complexity, they fall short in
approaching the theoretical performance limits in the typical URLLC short block
length regime. Conversely, quasi-ML decoding schemes for algebraic codes, like
Chase-II decoding, exhibit a smaller gap to optimum decoding but are
computationally prohibitive for practical deployment in URLLC systems. To
bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced Chase-II decoding algorithm that
leverages a neural network (NN) to predict promising perturbation patterns,
drastically reducing the number of required decoding trials. The proposed
approach combines the reliability of quasi-ML decoding with the efficiency of
NN inference, making it well-suited for time-sensitive and resource-constrained
applications.

rate. A two-step algorithm is proposed to determine PA activation scheme and
optimize the waveguide beamforming. Specifically, a low complexity spatial
correlation and distance based method is proposed for PA activation selection.
After determining the PA activation status, a semi-definite programming (SDP)
based successive convex approximation (SCA) is leveraged to obtain the optimal
waveguide beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed multiple
waveguides based PAs assisted RSMA method achieves better performance than
various benchmarking schemes.

Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration
for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple
radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase
profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller
encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and
consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel
channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal
training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable
absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its
signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly
used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase
configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation
algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the
entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank
properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for
communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical
investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation
technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware
configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel
estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized
reflection coefficients of its unit elements.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wearable technologies, such as AR glasses, demands
compact, energy-efficient sensors capable of high-precision measurements in
dynamic environments. Traditional Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW)
Laser Feedback Interferometry (LFI) sensors, while promising, falter in
applications that feature small distances, high velocities, shallow modulation,
and low-power constraints. We propose a novel sensor-processing pipeline that
reliably extracts distance and velocity measurements at distances as low as 1
cm. As a core contribution, we introduce a four-ramp modulation scheme that
resolves persistent ambiguities in beat frequency signs and overcomes spectral
blind regions caused by hardware limitations. Based on measurements of the
implemented pipeline, a noise model is defined to evaluate its performance and
sensitivity to several algorithmic and working point parameters. We show that
the pipeline generally achieves robust and low-noise measurements using
state-of-the-art hardware.

Abstract: Automotive radars are one of the essential enablers of advanced driver
assistance systems (ADASs). Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and
reliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents
and increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this
context is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the
reliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter
variations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may
affect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In
this work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel
imbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean
squares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to
estimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected
targets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior
knowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in
combination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed
method suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the
normal operation of the radar. Furthermore, it features reduced dependency on
specific targets of interest and faster update rates of the channel imbalance
estimation compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods. This
improvement is achieved by allowing for multiple targets in the angular
spectrum, whereas most other methods are restricted to only single targets in
the angular spectrum. The performance of the proposed method is validated using
various simulation scenarios and is supported by measurement results.
