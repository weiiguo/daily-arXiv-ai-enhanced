Another method, derived from\nthe principle of maximum entropy, has the Copy Lemma as a special case.\nNevertheless, none of the two presented variants is known to generate more\ninequalities than the iterated Copy Lemma.

Traditional iterative algorithms often\nstruggle in low signal-to-noise regimes and fail to capture complex and\nnon-ideal system characteristics. To address this, we propose a novel\nmodel-driven deep learning framework for channel estimation in RAQRs.\nSpecifically, we propose a Transformer-based unrolling architecture, termed\nURformer, which is derived by unrolling a stabilized variant of the\nexpectation-maximization Gerchberg-Saxton (EM-GS) algorithm. Specifically, each\nlayer of the proposed URformer incorporates three trainable modules: 1) a\nlearnable filter implemented by a neural network that replaces the fixed Bessel\nfunction ratio in the classic EM-GS algorithm; 2) a trainable gating mechanism\nthat adaptively combines classic and model-based updates to ensure training\nstability; and 3) a efficient channel Transformer block that learns to correct\nresidual errors by capturing non-local dependencies across the channel matrix.\nNumerical results demonstrate that the proposed URformer significantly\noutperforms classic iterative algorithms and conventional black-box neural\nnetworks with less pilot overhead."}

We present a\nsurvey-free, on-device sensor-fusion framework that builds a personalized,\nlightweight multi-source fingerprint (FP) database from pedestrian dead\nreckoning (PDR), WiFi/cellular, GNSS, and interaction time tags. Matching is\nperformed by an AI-enhanced dynamic time warping module (AIDTW) that aligns\nnoisy, asynchronous sequences. To turn perception into continually improving\nactions, a cloud-edge online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\nloop aggregates desensitized summaries and human feedback in the cloud to\noptimize a policy via proximal policy optimization (PPO), and periodically\ndistills updates to devices. Across indoor/outdoor scenarios, our system\nreduces network-transition latency (measured by time-to-switch, TTS) by 32-65%\nin daily environments compared with conventional baselines, without\nsite-specific pre-deployment."}

An end-to-end system model for\nwideband OFDM backscatter systems is derived, including detailed\ncharacterization of propagation channels, receiver chain impairments, RF tag\noperation, and unsynchronized network nodes. The theoretical system model is\nvalidated through experimental evaluation using actual hardware, demonstrating\nthe detailed model's accuracy. A practical bistatic ranging method that can\noperate with unsynchronized nodes is presented, along with the Cram\\'er-Rao\nLower Bound (CRLB) derived to show the achievable performance limits. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the system performance for communication, RF\nsensing, and ranging, while also benchmarking against the derived theoretical\nlimits. This analytical framework and experimental validation establish\nfundamental understanding of distributed, unsynchronized backscatter systems\nfor future machine-type communication networks that are deployed in massive\nscale, while remaining energy-efficient."}

Modulo (unlimited) sampling overcomes this limitation by\nfolding the signal before digitization, but existing recovery methods are\neither computationally intensive or constrained by loose oversampling bounds\nthat demand high sampling rates. In addition, none account for sampling jitter,\nwhich is unavoidable in practice. This paper revisits difference-based recovery\nand establishes new theoretical and practical guarantees. In the noiseless\nsetting, we prove that arbitrarily high difference order reduces the sufficient\noversampling factor from $2\\pi e$ to $\\pi$, substantially tightening classical\nbounds. For fixed order $N$, we derive a noise-aware sampling condition that\nguarantees stable recovery. For second-order difference-based recovery ($N=2$),\nwe further extend the analysis to non-uniform sampling, proving robustness\nunder bounded jitter. An FPGA-based hardware prototype demonstrates reliable\nreconstruction with amplitude expansion up to $\\rho = 108$, confirming the\nfeasibility of high-performance unlimited sensing with a simple and robust\nrecovery pipeline."}

Its efficacy lies in mapping\nhigh-dimensional channel data into low-dimensional features that preserve the\nrelative similarities of the original data. However, existing channel charting\nmethods are largely developed using simulated or indoor measurements, often\nassuming clean and complete channel data across all frequency bands. In\ncontrast, real-world channels collected from base stations are typically\nincomplete due to frequency hopping and are significantly noisy, particularly\nat cell edges. These challenging conditions greatly degrade the performance of\ncurrent methods. To address this, we propose a deep tensor learning method that\nleverages the inherent tensor structure of wireless channels to effectively\nextract informative while low-dimensional features (i.e., channel charts) from\nnoisy and incomplete measurements. Experimental results demonstrate the\nreliability and effectiveness of the proposed approach in these challenging\nscenarios."}

This\npaper addresses radio-based environment sensing considering these issues.\nSpecifically, graph theory (GT) is used to model the multi-bounce propagation\nof the near field. In this manner, indoor reflectors/scatterers are modeled as\nvertices in a propagation graph, the multi-bounce paths are modeled by the\nedges linking the vertices. Besides, the coupled multipath parameters in the\nnear field, i.e., range and angles, are denoted directly by the coordinates of\nvertices. Then, the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization\n(SAGE) algorithm is adapted to the proposed Graph theory-based dictionary-aided\nMulti-bounce SAGE (GM-SAGE), where the searching parameters including range and\nangle of departure/arrival (AoD/AoA) are transformed to the coordinates of\nscatterers in the graph. The proposed algorithm is validated through\nmeasurement-calibrated ray tracing (RT) in a complex indoor office. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposed GM-SAGE can deal with multi-bounce channels."}
