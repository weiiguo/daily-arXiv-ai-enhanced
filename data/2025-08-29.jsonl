However, the practical\nissues of high hardware cost and power consumption pose great challenges\ntowards the cost-effective implementation of XL-MIMO. To address such\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel concept called array configuration\ncodebook (ACC), which enables flexible XL-MIMO cost-effectively and improves\nthe system performance compared with conventional antenna selection (AS)\nschemes with limited number of RF chains. Specifically, ACC refers to a set of\npre-designed array configuration codewords, where each codeword specifies the\npositions of activated antenna pixels. Then, flexible XL-MIMO architecture can\nbe enabled via dynamical pixel activation based on the designed ACC, without\nhaving to exhaustively try all possible combinations of the antenna pixels\nactivations. As an illustration, we give a specific codebook design,\nencompassing the classic compact array (CA), uniform sparse array (USA),\nmodular array (MoA), nested array (NA), and co-prime array (CPA), and each\ncodeword is specified by one array configuration parameter. With the designed\nACC, array configuration training is considered for multi-UE communication to\nmaximize the sum rate. To reduce the training overhead of exhaustive scanning,\na two-stage scanning scheme is proposed, including the array- and pixel-level\nscanning. For comparison, the greedy AS scheme is proposed, where the resulting\nincremental SINR expression by activating antenna pixel sequentially is derived\nin closed-form. Subsequently, array configuration training is extended to the\nwireless localization scenario. Simulation results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of codeword optimization for scenarios of multi-UE communication\nand wireless localization."}
