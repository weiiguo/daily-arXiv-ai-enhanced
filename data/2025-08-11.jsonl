Recent work by Kadekodi et al.\ndemonstrates that adapting code parameters to varying disk failure rates can\nlead to significant storage savings without compromising reliability. Such\nadaptations, known as \\emph{code conversions}, motivate the design of\n\\emph{convertible codes}, which enable efficient transformations between codes\nof different parameters.\n  In this work, we study the setting in which $\\lambda$ codewords of an initial\n$[n^I = k^I + r^I,\\, k^I]$ MDS code are merged into a single codeword of a\nfinal $[n^F = \\lambda k^I + r^F,\\, k^F = \\lambda k^I]$ MDS code. We begin by\npresenting three constructions that achieve optimal \\emph{access cost}, defined\nas the total number of disks accessed during the conversion process. The first\ntwo constructions apply when $\\lambda \\leq r^I$ and impose specific\ndivisibility conditions on $r^I$ and the field size $q$. These schemes minimize\nboth the per-symbol and the overall access cost. The third construction, which\nbuilds on a prior scheme by Kong, achieves minimal access cost while supporting\narbitrary parameter regimes. All three constructions require field sizes that\nare linear in the final code length, and notably, the third construction\nachieves a field size that matches the lower bound implied by the MDS\nconjecture in almost all cases. In addition, we propose a construction that\noptimizes the \\emph{bandwidth cost}, defined as the total number of symbols\ntransmitted during conversion. This scheme is a refinement of Maturana and\nRashmi's bandwidth-optimal construction based on the piggybacking framework,\nand achieves reduced sub-packetization."}
