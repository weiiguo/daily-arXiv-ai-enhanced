This research presents a prompt-conditioned PSI compression system that\nintegrates prompt learning inspired by large models into the PSI compression\nprocess to address these difficulties. A hybrid prompt technique that\nintegrates soft prompt concatenation with feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)\nfacilitates adaptive encoding across diverse signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs),\nfading kinds, and compression ratios. Furthermore, a variable rate technique\nincorporates the compression ratio into the prompt embeddings through latent\nmasking, enabling a singular model to adeptly balance reconstruction accuracy.\nAdditionally, a lightweight depthwise convolutional gating (DWCG) decoder\nfacilitates precise feature reconstruction with minimal complexity.\nComprehensive simulations indicate that the proposed framework significantly\nreduces NMSE compared to traditional autoencoder baselines, while ensuring\nrobustness across various channel circumstances and accommodating variable\ncompression ratios within a single model.

To solve this problem, we propose a recursive coarse-to-fine\nmethodology that constructs a set of candidate locations for RIS placement\nbased on the obstacle configuration and evaluates them over multiple\ninstantiations from the user distribution. The search is recursively refined\nwithin the optimal region identified in each stage to determine the final\noptimal region for RIS deployment.

More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was\nintroduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,\nand which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,\nanalytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show\nthat LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary\ninformation about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both\nLCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of\n``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an\nupper bound on LCR for several values of the R\\'enyi-Hill order parameter and\nconjecture that this bound holds for all values.

The key idea is to partition the RIS\nconfiguration into two parts: the first part is designed to maximize the\ncommunication performance, while the second introduces small perturbations to\ngenerate multiple beams for multi-target sensing. Simulation results validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate that it achieves\nperformance comparable to SDR but with significantly lower computational\ncomplexity."}

Uploaded as\n  preprint for open access", "summary": "This paper presents a switch-type attenuator working from 20 to 100 GHz. The\nattenuator adopts a capacitive compensation technique to reduce phase error.\nThe small resistors in this work are implemented with metal lines to reduce the\nintrinsic parasitic capacitance, which helps minimize the amplitude and phase\nerrors over a wide frequency range. Moreover, the utilization of metal lines\nalso reduces the chip area. In addition, a continuous tuning attenuation unit\nis employed to improve the overall attenuation accuracy of the attenuator. The\npassive attenuator is designed and fabricated in a standard 65nm CMOS. The\nmeasurement results reveal a relative attenuation range of 7.5 dB with a\ncontinuous tuning step within 20-100 GHz. The insertion loss is 1.6-3.8 dB\nwithin the operation band, while the return losses of all states are better\nthan 11.5 dB. The RMS amplitude and phase errors are below 0.15 dB and\n1.6{\\deg}, respectively."}

While this property is closely related to range and\nvelocity estimation in sensing, this article focuses on other AFDM features\nthat are particularly relevant for addressing two challenges in integrated\nsensing and communication (ISAC) systems: (1) maintaining receiver complexity\nand energy consumption at acceptable levels while supporting the large\nbandwidths required for high delay/range resolution, and (2) mitigating\ninterference in multiradar environments. In monostatic sensing, where direct\ntransmitter-receiver leakage is a major impairment, we show that AFDM-based\nISAC receivers can address the first challenge through their compatibility with\nlow-complexity self-interference cancellation (SIC) schemes and reduced\nsampling rates via analog dechirping. In bistatic sensing, where such analog\nsolutions may not be feasible, we demonstrate that AFDM supports sub-Nyquist\nsampling without requiring hardware modifications while preserving delay\nresolution. Finally, we show that the second challenge can be addressed by\nleveraging the resource-assignment flexibility of the discrete affine Fourier\ntransform (DAFT) underlying the AFDM waveform."}

The users submit their jobs to the central server\naccording to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a\ndedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that\njob in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job\nassigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free\nstate, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain.\nUpon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies\nthat the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to\nthe machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of\njobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age\nof job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost,\nwe propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of\nthese policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will\nremain stable."}
