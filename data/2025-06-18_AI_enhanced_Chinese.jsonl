At high speeds and in cluttered environments, Doppler shifts and rapid multipath changes can dramatically raise packet error rates. This paper investigates these phenomena in the context of ExpressLRS (ELRS) long-range FPV control links and demonstrates a novel solution: real-time geometry tuning of a circularly polarized helical antenna array. This study integrates Maxwell-equation-based full-wave simulations (via Ansys HFSS) with controlled, blind field trials to validate performance. A new analysis framework incorporates Doppler-induced frequency offset into the antenna's radiation pattern and the system's error model. Compared to a conventional fixed antenna, the adaptive helical array shows a 20-30% PER reduction when drones exceed 150 mph. The adaptive system automatically adjusts coil pitch and diameter to retune the antenna as flight parameters (velocity, attitude) change. Measured VSWR stays near unity, preventing transmitter reflection spikes. RSSI variation is reduced by half, indicating stronger link stability in urban multi-path. A regression analysis confirms that the reduction in PER due to tuning is highly statistically significant. Calibration data and error analyses are provided to validate our methodology. These findings advance the understanding of high-mobility UAV communication channels and demonstrate that reconfigurable hardware-here, mechanically tunable helices-can effectively counter Doppler and multi-path impairments. The findings inform new design principles for UAV antenna arrays and suggest a path toward AI-integrated adaptive RF systems for drone swarms and racing platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673aFPV\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u51e0\u4f55\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u5706\u5f62\u6781\u5316\u87ba\u65cb\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5305\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u98de\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u9891\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u5f84\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u9ad8\u8bef\u5305\u7387\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Maxwell\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5168\u6ce2\u4eff\u771f\uff08Ansys HFSS\uff09\u548c\u76f2\u573a\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u87ba\u65cb\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u7ebf\u5708\u95f4\u8ddd\u548c\u76f4\u5f84\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u98de\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u87ba\u65cb\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7150 mph\u65f6\uff0c\u8bef\u5305\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8620-30%\uff0c\u4e14VSWR\u63a5\u8fd11\uff0cRSSI\u53d8\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u8c03\u87ba\u65cb\u5929\u7ebf\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u548c\u591a\u5f84\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aAI\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c04\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, in practice, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper considers a hybrid near-far field activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO, and establishes a covariance-based formulation, which facilitates the development of a distributed algorithm to alleviate the computational burden at the central processing unit (CPU). Specifically, each AP performs local activity detection for the devices and then transmits the detection result to the CPU for further processing. In particular, a novel coordinate descent algorithm based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury update with Taylor expansion is proposed to handle the local detection problem at each AP. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how the hybrid near-far field channels affect the detection performance. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u8fd1\u8fdc\u573a\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8fdc\u573a\u4f20\u64ad\u5047\u8bbe\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6df7\u5408\u8fd1\u8fdc\u573a\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u5904\u7406\u672c\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8fd1\u8fdc\u573a\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional MIMO, FAS involves joint port selection and precoder design, a combinatorial NP-hard optimization problem. Moreover, fully leveraging FAS requires acquiring Channel State Information (CSI) across its ports, a challenge exacerbated by the system's near-continuous reconfigurability. These factors make traditional system design methods impractical for FAS due to nonconvexity and prohibitive computational complexity. While deep learning (DL)-based approaches have been proposed for MIMO optimization, their limited generalization and fitting capabilities render them suboptimal for FAS.

The achievable FDMA rate region is also derived using the same optimization framework, while the TDMA rate region is obtained through an antenna position refinement approach. The analysis is then extended to the downlink PASS using the uplink-downlink duality framework.

Capasso's formula and its equivalents are incorrect, detailed in our article titled \"Mathematical proof of errors in Capasso's excess noise factor formula... .\"", "summary": "Multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are the solid-state analogue of photomultiplier tubes, owing to their deterministic amplification with twofold stepwise gain via impact ionization. Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u7ea7\u9636\u68af\u96ea\u5d29\u5149\u7535\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\uff08APDs\uff09\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u6e10\u53d8\u5e26\u9699APDs\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u8fc7\u5269\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u5b50\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e0eBangera\u5bf9Friis\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u5b50\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u7ea7\u9636\u68afAPDs\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u78b0\u649e\u7535\u79bb\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u968f\u7ea7\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8eFriis\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u5b50\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u5c06\u529f\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u89c6\u4e3a\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u7535\u79bb\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5c42\u6e10\u53d8\u5e26\u9699APDs\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e7f\u4e49\u8fc7\u5269\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u5b50\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u504f\u538b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e9a\u9608\u503c\u3001\u9636\u68af\u548c\u96a7\u7a7f\u51fb\u7a7f\u533a\u57df\uff09\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7b80\u5316\u9636\u68afAPDs\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u6e10\u53d8\u5e26\u9699APDs\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u540e\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e0eBangera\u5bf9Friis\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u5b50\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u9636\u68afAPDs\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aAPDs\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

When such errors are significant, considerable performance losses can be observed if the wireless transceiver is not adapted. Instead of refining the estimate by increasing the pilot sequence length or improving the estimation algorithm, we propose two new approaches based on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) decoders. The first method involves testing multiple candidates for the channel estimate located in the complex neighborhood around the original pilot-based estimate. All these candidates are employed in parallel to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR). These LLRs are used as soft input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). Posterior likelihood formulas associated with ORBGRAND are then computed to determine which channel candidate leads to the most probable codeword. The second method is a refined version of the first approach accounting for the presence of residual CEE in the LLR computation. The performance of these two techniques is evaluated for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes. For the considered settings, block error rate (BLER) gains of several dBs are observed compared to cases where CEE is ignored.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGRAND\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea0\u6b63\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff08CEE\uff09\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u4e2a\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u5019\u9009\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97LLR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ORBGRAND\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u7801\u5b57\uff1b2. \u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5269\u4f59CEE\u5bf9LLR\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728[128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar\u548cCRC\u7801\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5ffd\u7565CEE\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0cBLER\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6570dB\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7GRAND\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9CEE\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
