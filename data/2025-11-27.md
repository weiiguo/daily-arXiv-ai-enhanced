Abstract: Recently, Wi-Fi signals have emerged as a powerful tool for contactless sensing. During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications.

### [2] [A Fully Multivariate Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis Method for Fault Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20831)
*Khuram Naveed,Naveed ur Rehman*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全多变量化的多重分形去趋势波动分析(FM-MFDFA)方法，用于多通道机器振动数据的故障诊断，通过引入协方差加权的Lpq矩阵范数和马氏距离来捕捉跨通道依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MFDFA方法在处理多通道振动数据时无法有效捕捉通道间的依赖关系和方差偏差，需要开发能够准确表征多变量信号多尺度结构的分析方法。

Method: 基于马氏距离引入协方差加权的Lpq矩阵范数定义完全多变量波动函数，结合多变量变分模态分解(MVMD)分离故障相关分量，然后应用FM-MFDFA进行特征提取。

Result: 在风力涡轮机齿轮箱数据上的实验表明，该方法优于传统MFDFA方法，即使在噪声条件下也能有效区分健康和故障机器状态。

Conclusion: FM-MFDFA框架为多通道振动数据分析提供了更准确的多尺度特征提取能力，在机械故障诊断中具有优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a fully multivariate generalization of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and leverage it to develop a fault diagnosis framework for multichannel machine vibration data. We introduce a novel covariance-weighted $L_{pq}$ matrix norm based on Mahalanobis distance to define a fully multivariate fluctuation function that uniquely captures cross-channel dependencies and variance biases in multichannel vibration data. This formulation, termed FM-MFDFA, allows for a more accurate characterization of the multiscale structure of multivariate signals. To enhance feature relevance, the proposed framework integrates multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) to isolate fault-relevant components before applying FM-MFDFA. Results on wind turbine gearbox data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional MFDFA approaches by effectively distinguishing between healthy and faulty machine states, even under noisy conditions.

### [3] [Wavelet-Guided Water-Level Estimation for ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20936)
*Ayoob Salari,Kai Wu,Khawaja Fahad Masood,Y. Jay Guo,J. Andrew Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于LTE下行功率指标的被动式低成本水位监测方法，利用连续小波变换提取潮汐特征，结合轻量级神经网络实现高精度水位跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水位监测方法依赖固定仪器，成本高且易受极端事件影响，需要一种低成本、易部署的替代方案。

Method: 使用LTE接收器报告的RSRP、RSSI和RSQR指标，通过连续小波变换提取潮汐分量特征，结合轻量级神经网络学习水位变化，支持多基站协同融合。

Result: 在420米河流路径上，视距条件下RMSE为0.8cm，MAE为0.5cm；非视距条件下经过微调后RMSE为1.7cm，MAE为0.8cm。

Conclusion: 该方法无需阵列校准，可在标准硬件上运行，比基于CSI的方法更实用，多基站融合可进一步提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Real-time water-level monitoring across many locations is vital for flood response, infrastructure management, and environmental forecasting. Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness.

Abstract: Current rehabilitation of lower limb prostheses has significant challenges, especially with skin conditions, irritation and discomfort. Understanding the skin temperature and having comfortable wearable sensors that would monitor skin temperature in a real-time outdoor environment would be useful. The system would help the user and orthopedic technician to provide feedback and changes that might be required in the prosthesis. Hence in this paper, a series of experiments are conducted in order to understand and characterize the system behavior and compare a general thermistor and a modified thermistor as a potential method of temperature measurement for outdoor usage of prostheses. The paper goes on to compare the different modified thermistors behavior with their regular counterpart and highlights the challenges and improvement areas needed for such a modified thermistor for outdoor temperature monitoring in a prosthetic system. Initial results show that some of the modified thermistors showed better temperature recording compared to the rest. Finally, such modified thermistors can be a potential alternative for comfortable temperature measurement embedded in the prosthesis system. Such a system can provide valuable insights into temperature distribution and an early warning system for skin problems

Abstract: Subsurface defects such as delamination, voids, and honeycombing critically affect the durability of concrete bridge decks but are difficult to detect reliably using visual inspection or manual sounding. This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale.

### [6] [Blind Turbo Demodulation for Differentially Encoded OFDM with 2D Trellis Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21345)
*Chin-Hung Chen,Yan Wu,Wim van Houtum,Alex Alvarado*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全盲的turbo-DE-PSK方案，无需导频即可联合估计信道相位、信道增益和噪声方差，在DAB-like系统中实现了接近完美信道知识的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在DAB-like系统中，turbo-DE-PSK接收机虽然通过迭代解码提供了显著性能增益，但依赖无导频的准确信道估计，这是实际应用中的关键挑战。

Method: 采用二维网格分解进行盲相位估计，配合基于功率的信道增益和噪声方差估计器，开发了完全盲的turbo-DE-PSK方案。

Result: 仿真结果表明，盲二维turbo解调器接近完美信道知识接收机的性能，并在实际传输条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该盲turbo-DE-PSK方案成功解决了DAB-like系统中无导频信道估计的挑战，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)-like systems employ differentially encoded (DE) phase-shift keying (PSK) for transmission. While turbo-DE-PSK receivers offer substantial performance gains through iterative decoding by making the DE-PSK an inner code, they rely on accurate channel estimation without pilots, which is a key challenge in DAB-like scenarios. This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance. We provide a comprehensive system assessment across practical system parameters, including inner code length, phase quantization, and 2D block size. Simulation results show that the blind 2D turbo demodulator approaches the performance of receivers with perfect channel knowledge and remains robust under realistic transmission conditions.

### [7] [2D Sparse Array Design via Reweighted L1 Second Order Cone Programming for 3D Ultrasound Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21133)
*Xi Zhang,Miguel Bernal,Wei-Ning Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二阶锥规划和重加权L1技术的稀疏阵列设计方法，用于减少3D超声成像中的通道数量，在保持分辨率的同时实现高对比度性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全寻址2D阵列需要数千个独立通道，成本高昂。现有随机优化方法设计的稀疏阵列结果不稳定，需要更可靠的设计方法。

Method: 将稀疏阵列合成问题建模为二阶锥规划(SOCP)，并采用重加权L1技术进行序列优化，设计出具有准平坦旁瓣的2D稀疏阵列。

Result: 设计的Q-Flats阵列具有252个激活单元，旁瓣电平不高于-21.26 dB。与密集阵列、费马螺旋阵列和锥形螺旋阵列相比，Q-Flats在分辨率上优于螺旋阵列约3%，对比度略差。

Conclusion: 重加权L1 SOCP方法是一种有前景且灵活的方法，能够在分辨率、对比度和激活单元数量之间寻求平衡。

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) fully-addressed arrays can conveniently realize three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging while fully controlled such arrays usually demands thousands of independent channels, which is costly. Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements.

Conclusion: MAPES为AI辅助微波电路和RFIC设计提供了高效、可扩展且可靠的实用工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analytical framework, termed the Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES). MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies.

Conclusion: 该算法能有效解决相位模糊问题，显著提高盲信道估计性能，同时保持较低的实现复杂度。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.

Conclusion: 所提出的分组语义分割多址接入框架能够有效提升多用户语义通信的性能，为下一代无线网络的语义通信提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a group-wise semantic splitting multiple access framework for multi-user semantic communication in downlink scenarios. The framework begins by applying a balanced clustering mechanism that groups users based on the similarity of their semantic characteristics, enabling the extraction of group-level common features and user-specific private features. The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.26% performance improvement over conventional schemes across various channel conditions, validating its robustness and semantic efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: This work describes the design and implementation of a low-power wireless communication system for transmitting text using ESP32 modules and the LoRa DXLR01. The proposal arises as a solution to connectivity and energy-efficiency problems commonly found in rural areas and certain urban environments where Wi-Fi or mobile networks are unavailable or operate with limitations. To address this, LoRa technology known for its long-range capability and low power consumption is integrated with an ESP32 responsible for capturing, processing, and sending messages.
  The LoRa DXLR01 module, which operates in the 433 MHz band, is configured with parameters aimed at maximising both transmission range and efficient energy usage. Messages are sent using Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, improving signal penetration in obstructed areas and reducing the likelihood of errors. On the receiving end, the ESP32 interprets the data and displays it on an LCD screen. Additionally, the received information is sent to the ThingSpeak platform, allowing remote storage and visualisation without relying on conventional network infrastructure.
  Tests conducted in a controlled environment show an average latency of 3.2 seconds for text transmission. It was also verified that the system can be used in applications such as remote monitoring, infrastructure management, and access control.

Method: 在最小均方误差均衡条件下，分析AFBM波形在仿射域和滤波时域两个域中的信号干扰比，并考虑离散仿射傅里叶变换和去扩频/映射的影响

Result: 发现滤波时域中存在信道诱导干扰与正交性近似误差的意外抵消现象，这种抵消在仿射域中不会发生，导致滤波时域检测方案性能显著优于仿射域检测

Conclusion: 滤波时域检测方案通过信道诱导干扰与正交性近似误差的抵消机制，实现了比仿射域检测更优的误码率性能

Abstract: The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the Affine Filter Bank Modulation (AFBM) waveform is analyzed under minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization in two domains; namely, the affine domain and the filtered time-domain (TD). Due to the incorporation of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) and despreading/mapping, an interesting and counter-intuitive cancellation of the unwanted combination of the channel induced interference with the orthogonality approximation error is seen in the filtered TD, a process which does not occur in the affine domain. The direct impact on bit error rate (BER) provides a thorough validation of the proposed analysis and explains the substantial gains in performance of the filtered TD detection scheme as opposed to its affine domain equivalent

Abstract: Thermal noise communication (TNC) enables ultra-low-power wireless links for Internet of Things (IoT) devices by modulating the variance of thermal noise, rather than using active carriers. Existing analyses often rely on Gaussian approximations and overlook fading effects, which limits their accuracy. This paper presents an accurate analytical framework for optimal bit detection in TNC systems under Rician fading. Using chi-squared statistics, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood detection threshold and an expression for the bit error probability (BEP) via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The proposed model eliminates approximation errors and accurately characterizes performance for finite sample sizes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the analytical results and demonstrate significant improvements in BEP compared with suboptimal Gaussian-based detection. Furthermore, the influence of key parameters, sample size, resistance ratio, and Rician K-factor, is quantified. The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for designing energy-efficient TNC receivers in future B5G/6G and large-scale IoT systems.
