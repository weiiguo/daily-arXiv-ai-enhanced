In this paper, we investigate the single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication\nsystems aided by a transmissive FIM. In the SISO scenario, we jointly optimize\nthe FIM phase shift matrix and surface shape to maximize the end-to-end channel\ngain. First, we derive the optimal phase-shift matrix for each tentative FIM\nsurface shape to decompose the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem\ninto multiple one-dimensional subproblems. Then, we utilize the particle swarm\noptimization (PSO) algorithm and the multi-interval gradient descent (MIGD)\nmethod for updating the FIM's surface shape to maximize the channel gain.
