### [1] [Distributed MIMO With Over-the-Air Phase Calibration Integrated Into the TDD Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03722)
*Khac-Hoang Ngo,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在分布式MIMO系统中通过调整TDD时隙结构来集成AP间相位校准测量的方法，并分析了校准资源与系统频谱效率之间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式MIMO系统中多个接入点(AP)需要周期性相位校准以实现联合相干波束成形，传统方法需要专门的校准时间，影响系统效率。

Method: 通过调整TDD时隙结构的上行/下行切换点，创建短时间段供AP之间进行空中测量，实现相位校准与TDD流程的集成。

Result: 该方法可扩展到大网络，分析了共轭波束成形和迫零波束成形下校准资源投入与频谱效率的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 证明了通过空中AP间测量集成到TDD流程中的分布式MIMO相位校准的可行性。

Abstract: Reciprocity-based, joint coherent downlink beamforming from multiple access
points (APs) in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with
independent local oscillators (LOs) requires the APs to be periodically
phase-calibrated (a.k.a. phase-synchronized or phase-aligned). Such phase
alignment can be accomplished by bidirectional over-the-air measurements
between the APs. In this paper, we show how such over-the-air measurements can
be integrated into the time-division duplexing (TDD) flow by appropriately
shifting the uplink/downlink switching points of the TDD slot structure,
creating short time segments during which APs can measure on one another. We
also show how this technique scales to large networks. Furthermore, we
analytically characterize the tradeoff between the amount of resources spent on
calibration measurements and the resulting spectral efficiency of the system,
when conjugate beamforming or zero-forcing beamforming is used. The results
demonstrate the feasibility of distributed MIMO with phase-calibration through
over-the-air inter-AP measurements integrated into the TDD flow.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可移动天线的多用户MIMO下行系统，通过两时间尺度优化来最大化平均可实现和速率，包括梯度上升算法和CSSCA算法来解决短时和长时优化问题。

Conclusion: 可移动天线技术结合两时间尺度优化能有效提升多用户MIMO系统的性能，平面移动模式提供了高效的实现方案。

Abstract: This paper studies a novel movable antenna (MA)-enhanced multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output downlink system designed to improve wireless
communication performance. We aim to maximize the average achievable sum rate
through two-timescale optimization exploiting instantaneous channel state
information at the receiver (I-CSIR) for receive antenna position vector (APV)
design and statistical channel state information at the transmitter (S-CSIT)
for transmit APV and covariance matrix design. We first decompose the resulting
stochastic optimization problem into a series of short-term problems and one
long-term problem. Then, a gradient ascent algorithm is proposed to obtain
suboptimal receive APVs for the short-term problems for given I-CSIR samples.
Based on the output of the gradient ascent algorithm, a series of convex
objective/feasibility surrogates for the long-term problem are constructed and
solved utilizing the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation
(CSSCA) algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a planar movement mode for the
receive MAs to facilitate efficient antenna movement and the development of a
low-complexity primal-dual decomposition-based stochastic successive convex
approximation (PDD-SSCA) algorithm, which finds Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
solutions almost surely. Our numerical results reveal that, for both the
general and the planar movement modes, the proposed two-timescale MA-enhanced
system design significantly improves the average achievable sum rate and the
feasibility of the formulated problem compared to benchmark schemes.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations play a pivotal role in
sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks by providing global coverage, massive
connections, and huge capacity. In this paper, we present a novel LEO satellite
constellation communication framework, where a reconfigurable intelligent
surface-mounted unmanned aerial vehicle (RIS-UAV) is deployed to improve the
communication quality of multiple terrestrial user equipments (UEs) under the
condition of long distance between satellite and ground. To reduce the overhead
for channel state information (CSI) acquisition with multiple-satellite
collaboration, statistical CSI (sCSI) is utilized in the system. In such a
situation, we first derive an approximated but exact expression for ergodic
rate of each UE. Then, we aim to maximize the minimum approximated UE ergodic
rate by the proposed alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that jointly
optimizes LEO satellite beamforming, RIS phase shift, and UAV trajectory.
Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed algorithm in terms of spectrum efficiency over baseline
algorithms.

### [4] [Non-Reed-Solomon Type MDS Codes from Elliptic Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04247)
*Puyin Wang,Wei Liu,Jinquan Luo,Dengxin Zhai*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一类新的基于椭圆曲线的MDS码，其长度接近理论最大值，且被证明不等价于Reed-Solomon码。通过使用更一般的除子选择，构造了长度约为(q+1+⌊2√q⌋)/2的码，证明了已知上界的紧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有椭圆曲线MDS码构造多依赖于无穷远点，限制了码的长度和多样性。本文旨在探索更一般的除子选择，构造更长的MDS码，并证明其与RS码的不等价性。

Method: 采用椭圆曲线上的除子理论，考虑在仿射点上支持的除子和由多个不同点组成的除子，构建MDS码。通过计算生成矩阵的Schur积的秩来证明与RS码的不等价性。

Result: 成功构造了长度接近理论最大值的MDS码，具体长度约为(q+1+⌊2√q⌋)/2。详细比较表明这些码未被先前结果覆盖，且通过显式计算证明了与RS码的不等价性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的构造方法扩展了椭圆曲线MDS码的设计空间，证明了已知长度上界的紧性，并为构造不等价于RS码的MDS码提供了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new family of MDS codes derived from elliptic
curves. These codes attain lengths close to the theoretical maximum and are
provably inequivalent to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Unlike many previous
constructions that rely on the point at infinity, our approach allows for more
general choices: we consider divisors supported on affine points and divisors
consisting of multiple distinct points. This broader framework enables the
construction of codes with length approximately $(q + 1 + \lfloor 2\sqrt{q}
\rfloor)/2$, further illustrating the tightness of known upper bounds on
elliptic MDS code lengths. A detailed comparison shows that our codes are not
covered by earlier results. Moreover, we show that their inequivalence to RS
codes by explicitly computing the rank of the Schur product of their generator
matrices.

### [5] [Multi-Sensor Fusion for Extended Object Tracking Exploiting Active and Passive Radio Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03686)
*Hong Zhu,Alexander Venus,Erik Leitinger,Klaus Witrisal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种贝叶斯定位方法，融合主动测量和被动多基地雷达测量，处理用户遮挡LOS链路时的定位问题，通过多传感器概率数据关联算法提升OLOS条件下的定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无线电设备定位中由于用户自身遮挡LOS链路导致的定位不可靠问题，传统方法忽略用户作为扩展物体的散射、衰减和阻挡效应。

Method: 建立用户扩展物体模型，提出贝叶斯方法融合设备与锚点的主动测量和锚点间经用户反射的被动雷达测量，开发多传感器多测量概率数据关联算法处理测量来源不确定性。

Result: 在合成和真实无线电测量数据上的评估表明，该方法在OLOS条件下优于基于点目标假设的传统PDA方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的扩展物体建模和多传感器融合方法能有效提升用户遮挡LOS链路时的定位精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reliable and robust positioning of radio devices remains a challenging task
due to multipath propagation, hardware impairments, and interference from other
radio transmitters. A frequently overlooked but critical factor is the agent
itself, e.g., the user carrying the device, which potentially obstructs
line-of-sight (LOS) links to the base stations (anchors). This paper addresses
the problem of accurate positioning in scenarios where LOS links are partially
blocked by the agent. The agent is modeled as an extended object (EO) that
scatters, attenuates, and blocks radio signals. We propose a Bayesian method
that fuses ``active'' measurements (between device and anchors) with
``passive'' multistatic radar-type measurements (between anchors, reflected by
the EO). To handle measurement origin uncertainty, we introduce an multi-sensor
and multiple-measurement probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm that
jointly fuses all EO-related measurements. Furthermore, we develop an EO model
tailored to agents such as human users, accounting for multiple reflections
scattered off the body surface, and propose a simplified variant for
low-complexity implementation. Evaluation on both synthetic and real radio
measurements demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional
PDA methods based on point target assumptions, particularly during and after
obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) conditions.

### [6] [Sensor placement for sparse force reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03825)
*Jeunghoon Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 基于Gram矩阵的传感器布置策略，通过最小化Gram矩阵边对角元素能量来提高频域力量重构准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决频域力量重构中传感器优化布置问题，通过分析Gram矩阵特性来提高重构精度

Method: 提出贪心算法选择传感器位置，最小化Gram矩阵的边对角元素能量，在空间相关性低的节点区域布置传感器

Result: 数值模拟和实验验证显示，该方法在力量估计中表现出更高的精度和稳健性，超越了经验法布置方案

Conclusion: Gram矩阵基于传感器布置策略能够有效提高稀疏力量重构的准确性，为结构健康监测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The present study proposes a Gram-matrix-based sensor placement strategy for
sparse force reconstruction in the frequency domain. A modal decomposition of
the Gram matrix reveals that its structure is dominated by a few modes near the
target frequency, and that each modal contribution reflects the spatial
correlation of the corresponding mode shape. This suggests that placing sensors
near nodal regions where spatial correlation is low can reduce coherence in the
frequency response function (FRF) matrix and improve force reconstruction
accuracy. To translate the physical insight into a practical design framework,
a greedy algorithm is proposed to select sensor locations that minimize the
off-diagonal energy of the Gram matrix. Numerical simulations and experimental
validations demonstrate that the proposed method yields robust and accurate
force estimation, outperforming heuristic sensor layouts.

Conclusion: 该低成本开源跟踪系统不仅为蜜蜂巢定位提供了可扩展框架，还在环境监测等领域具有广阔应用前景

Abstract: The Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) poses a serious threat to ecosystems and
beekeeping. Locating nests is essential, but usually involves time-consuming
manual triangulation. We present a low-cost, open-source tracking system based
on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The system consists of a lightweight BLE tag and
a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented in GNU Radio. By bypassing
the BLE stack, we embed a custom pseudo-noise (PN) sequence in the uncoded PHY
for correlation-based detection. Using a Yagi antenna and PlutoSDR, the
receiver performs digital beam sweeping to determine the tag's direction. Field
tests show reliable angular resolution at 50m and a communication range up to
360m. While our modulation increases receiver complexity, it enables future
improvements such as multichannel spreading and tag identification. The design
is fully open-source and provides a scalable framework for hornet tracking and
related applications in environmental monitoring.

Result: 模拟结果表明，所提方法实现了稳健的检测性能，并在现有最先进技术基础上获得了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: 通过结构化稀疏恢复和双重稀疏约束，新的AMP算法有效解决了OTFS系统中的多前导碰检测问题，为随机访问系统提供了更优秀的解决方案

Abstract: This article addresses the problem of multiple preamble detection in random
access systems based on orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signaling. This
challenge is formulated as a structured sparse recovery problem in the complex
domain. To tackle it, the authors propose a new approximate message passing
(AMP) algorithm that enforces double sparsity: the sparse selection of
preambles and the inherent sparsity of OTFS signals in the delay-Doppler
domain. From an algorithmic standpoint, the non-separable complex sparsity
constraint necessitates a careful derivation and leads to the design of a novel
AMP denoiser. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
robust detection performance and delivers significant gains over
state-of-the-art techniques.

### [9] [Joint Frequency-Space Sparse Reconstruction for DOA Estimation under Coherent Sources and Amplitude-Phase Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03983)

Conclusion: 方法不需迭代优化，计算复杂度低，能有效处理相关源和阵列错误问题

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a joint frequency-space sparse reconstruction
method for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which effectively addresses
the issues arising from the existence of coherent sources and array
amplitude-phase errors. Specifically, by using an auxiliary source with known
angles, we first construct the real steering vectors (RSVs) based on the
spectral peaks of received signals in the frequency domain, which serve as a
complete basis matrix for compensation for amplitude-phase errors. Then, we
leverage the spectral sparsity of snapshot data in the frequency domain and the
spatial sparsity of incident directions to perform the DOA estimation according
to the sparse reconstruction method. The proposed method does not require
iterative optimization, hence exhibiting low computational complexity.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DOA estimation method achieves
higher estimation accuracy for coherent sources as compared to various
benchmark schemes.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了HANA-JSCC语义图像传输系统，通过信道矩阵和噪声自适应机制解决MIMO系统中信道估计误差问题，相比现有方法性能提升0.40-0.54dB。

Method: 提出信道矩阵适配器与信道编解码器协作适应不准确的信道状态信息；引入两阶段训练策略和知识蒸馏解决估计信道矩阵与真实信道矩阵之间的一对多不适定问题。

Result: 在各种噪声和估计误差水平下，HANA-JSCC在多个数据集上平均性能比最先进基准方法高0.40-0.54dB。

Conclusion: HANA-JSCC系统有效缓解了MIMO语义通信中的信道估计误差影响，通过自适应机制和创新的训练策略实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemComm) has emerged as a new communication paradigm.
To enhance efficiency, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology has
been further integrated into SemComm systems. However, existing MIMO SemComm
systems assume perfect channel matrix estimation for channel-adaptive joint
source-channel coding, which is impractical due to hardware and pilot overhead
constraints. In this paper, we propose a semantic image transmission system
with channel matrix and channel noise adaptation, named HANA-JSCC, to cope with
channel estimation errors in MIMO systems. We propose a channel matrix adaptor
that collaborates with the channel codec to adapt to misaligned channel state
information, thereby mitigating the impact of estimation errors. Since the
relationship between the estimated channel matrix and true channel matrix is
ill-posed (one-to-many), we further introduce a two-stage training strategy
with knowledge distillation to overcome the convergence difficulties caused by
the ill-posed problem. Comparing with the state-of-the-art benchmarks,
HANA-JSCC achieves $0.40\sim0.54$dB higher average performance across various
noise and estimation error levels in various datasets.

Result: 星座整形能够实现感知与通信性能的灵活权衡，接近理论上限，显著优于传统调制格式；提出的广义PAS方法具有低复杂度实现可行性，结合传统PAS可接近联合星座整形的性能。

Conclusion: 星座整形是提升ISAC系统性能的有效方法，能够突破传统调制格式的限制，实现感知与通信性能的协同优化，为实际ISAC系统部署提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) promises new use cases for
mobile communication systems by reusing the communication signal for radar-like
sensing. However, sensing and communications (S&C) impose conflicting
requirements on the modulation format, resulting in a tradeoff between their
corresponding performance. This paper investigates constellation shaping as a
means to simultaneously improve S&C performance in orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC systems. We begin by deriving how the
transmit symbols affect detection performance and derive theoretical lower and
upper bounds on the maximum achievable information rate under a given sensing
constraint. Using an autoencoder-based optimization, we investigate geometric,
probabilistic, and joint constellation shaping, where joint shaping combines
both approaches, employing both optimal maximum a-posteriori decoding and
practical bit-metric decoding. Our results show that constellation shaping
enables a flexible trade-off between S&C, can approach the derived upper bound,
and significantly outperforms conventional modulation formats. Motivated by its
practical implementation feasibility, we review probabilistic amplitude shaping
(PAS) and propose a generalization tailored to ISAC. For this generalization,
we propose a low-complexity log-likelihood ratio computation with negligible
rate loss. We demonstrate that combining conventional and generalized PAS
enables a flexible and low-complexity tradeoff between S&C, closely approaching
the performance of joint constellation shaping.

Conclusion: 该方案为慢速弱目标检测提供了更可靠的解决方案，虽然以更高的计算成本为代价，但在实际应用中具有良好的效果。

Abstract: Reliable slow-moving weak target detection in complicated environments is
challenging due to the masking effects from the surrounding strong reflectors.
The traditional Moving Target Indication (MTI) may suppress the echoes from not
only the static interference objects (IOs), but also the desired slow-moving
weak target. According to the low-rank and sparse properties of the
range-velocity maps across different radar scans, a novel clutter suppression
scheme based on the Go decomposition (Godec) framework is proposed in this
paper. The simulation results show that with the existence of masking effects,
the target detection scheme based on Godec clutter suppression can reliably
detect the slow-moving weak target, compared to the traditional MTI-based
scheme. Besides, the time consumption comparison is conducted, demonstrating
that the proposed solution is one that sacrifices time complexity in exchange
for enhanced reliability. Additionally, the tradeoffs among the number of false
alarm cells, the detection probability and the iteration times for convergence
have been revealed, guiding parameter settings of the proposed solution in
practical applications. Experiment validation is also conducted to verify the
proposed solution, providing further insight into the scenarios where the
solution is most applicable.

Abstract: Relative localization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in global
navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environments is essential for
emergency rescue and battlefield reconnaissance. Existing methods suffer from
significant localization errors among UAVs due to packet loss and high
computational complexity in large swarms. This paper proposes a
clustering-based framework where the UAVs simultaneously use communication
signals for channel estimation and ranging. Firstly, the spectral clustering is
utilized to divide the UAV swarm into different sub-clusters, where matrix
completion and multidimensional scaling yield high-precision relative
coordinates. Subsequently, a global map is created by the inter-cluster anchor
fusion. A case study of UAV integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) system
is presented, where the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is adopted for
ranging and communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method
reduces localization errors in large swarms and loss of range information. It
also explores the impact of signal parameters on communication and
localization, highlighting the interplay between communication and localization
performance.
