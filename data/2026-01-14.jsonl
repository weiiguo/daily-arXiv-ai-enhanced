Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) > 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control. Overall, PVT provides a viable complement to GVT for extracting low-frequency modal information and motivates pursuing future work on automated throttle scheduling and coupling-aware test planning."}

Existing compressive sensing (CS)-based and deep learning (DL)- based schemes preprocess the channel by truncating it in the angular-delay domain. However, the energy leakage effect caused by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) basis will be more serious and leads to a bottleneck in recovery accuracy when applied to wideband channels such as those in U6G. To solve this problem, we introduce the Loewner Interpolation (LI) framework which generates a set of dynamic bases based on the current CSI matrix, enabling highly efficient compression in the frequency domain. Then, the LI basis is further compressed in the spatial domain through a neural network. To achieve a flexible trade-off between feedback overhead and recovery accuracy, we design a rateless auto-encoder trained with tail dropout and a multi-objective learning schedule, supporting variable-length feedback with a singular model. Meanwhile, the codewords are ranked by importance, ensuring that the base station (BS) can still maintain acceptable reconstruction performance under limited feedback with tail erasures. Furthermore, an adaptive quantization strategy is developed for the feedback framework to enhance robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could achieve higher CSI feedback accuracy with less or equal feedback overhead, and improve spectral efficiency compared with baseline schemes."}

However, the practical deployment of BF-IoT is significantly constrained by the limited communication range of common backscatter tags, which typically operate with a range of merely a few meters due to inherent round-trip path loss. Meta-backscatter systems that utilize metamaterial tags present a promising solution, retaining the inherent advantages of BF-IoT while breaking the critical communication range barrier. By leveraging densely paved sub-wavelength units to concentrate the reflected signal power, metamaterial tags enable a significant communication range extension over existing BF-IoT tags that employ omni-directional antennas. In this paper, we synthesize the principles and paradigms of metamaterial sensing to establish a unified design framework and a forward-looking research roadmap. Specifically, we first provide an overview of backscatter communication, encompassing its development history, working principles, and tag classification. We then introduce the design methodology for both metamaterial tags and their compatible transceivers.

In this setting, strands are arranged in an array and synthesized according to a fixed global synthesis sequence, with the restriction that at most one strand per row may be synthesized in any synthesis cycle. We focus on the basic case of two strands in a single row and analyze the expected completion time under this row-constrained model. By decomposing the process into a Markov chain, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expected synthesis time. We show that a simple laggard-first policy achieves an asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for any alphabet of size q, and that no online policy without look-ahead can asymptotically outperform this bound. For the binary case, we show that allowing a single-symbol look-ahead strictly improves performance, yielding an asymptotic expected completion time of 7L/3. Finally, we present a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal offline schedule for any fixed pair of sequences. Together, these results provide the first analytical bounds for synthesis under spatial constraints and lay the groundwork for future studies of optimal synthesis policies in such settings."}

Traditional methods, such as ray tracing and model-based approaches, often face challenges due to high computational complexity and discrepancies between models and real-world environments. In contrast, deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, offering accurate path loss predictions with reduced computational complexity. In our research, we introduce a ResNet-based model designed to enhance path loss prediction. We employ innovative techniques to capture key features of the environment by generating transmission (Tx) and reception (Rx) depth maps, as well as a distance map from the geographic data. Recognizing the significant attenuation caused by signal reflection and diffraction, particularly at high frequencies, we have developed a weighting map that emphasizes the areas adjacent to the direct path between Tx and Rx for path loss prediction. {Extensive simulations demonstrate that our model outperforms PPNet, RPNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT) by 1.2-3.0 dB using dataset of ITU challenge 2024 and ICASSP 2023.

We identify a dichotomy in the Stein-exponent of all these setups depending on the structure of the DMC's transition law. Under any of these three constraints, when the DMC is partially-connected (i.e., some outputs cannot be induced by certain inputs) the Stein-exponent matches the exponent identified by Han and Kobayashi and by Shalaby and Papamarcou for the scenario where communication is of zero-rate but over a noiseless link. We prove our result by adapting Han's zero-rate coding strategy to partially-connected DMCs.\n  In contrast, for fully-connected DMCs, in our scenarios 1) and 2) the Stein-exponent collapses to that of a local test at the decision center, rendering the remote sensor and communication useless. %To prove this result, we propose new converse proofs relying on change of measure arguments.\n  In scenario 3), the sensor remains beneficial even for fully-connected DMCs, however also collapses compared to the case of a partially-connected DMC. Moreover, the Stein-exponent is larger when the expectation constraint is imposed only under the null hypothesis compared to when it is imposed under both hypotheses.

Unlike computer vision, wireless sensing relies on hardware-dependent channel measurements whose representations, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation protocols vary significantly across devices and datasets, hindering fair comparison and reproducibility.\n  This paper proposes the Sensing Data Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level abstraction and unified benchmark for scalable wireless sensing. SDP acts as a standardization layer that decouples learning tasks from hardware heterogeneity. To this end, SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sanitization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts. Rather than introducing task-specific models, SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDP achieves competitive accuracy while substantially improving stability, reducing inter-seed performance variance by orders of magnitude on complex activity recognition tasks. A real-world experiment using commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware further illustrating the protocol's interoperability across heterogeneous hardware.

Varley"], "title": "The many faces of multivariate information", "comment": null, "summary": "Extracting higher-order structures from multivariate data has become an area of intensive study in complex systems science, as these multipartite interactions can reveal insights into fundamental features of complex systems like emergent phenomena. Information theory provides a natural language for exploring these interactions, as it elegantly formalizes the problem of comparing ``wholes\" and ``parts\" using joint, conditional, and marginal entropies. A large number of distinct statistics have been developed over the years, all aiming to capture different aspects of ``higher-order\" information sharing. Here, we show that three of them (the dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) are special cases of a more general function, $Δ^{k}$ which is parameterized by a free parameter $k$. For different values of $k$, we recover different measures: $Δ^{0}$ is equal to the S-information, $Δ^{1}$ is equal to the dual total correlation, and $Δ^{2}$ is equal to the negative O-information. Generally, the $Δ^{k}$ function is arranged into a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies; for a given value of $k$, if $Δ^{k}>0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order greater than $k$, while if $Δ^{k}<0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order lower than $k$. $Δ^{k}=0$ if the system is composed entirely of synergies of order-k. Using the entropic conjugation framework, we also find that the conjugate of $Δ^{k}$, which we term $Γ^{k}$ is arranged into a similar hierarchy of increasingly high-order redundancies. These results provide new insights into the nature of both higher-order redundant and synergistic interactions, and helps unify the existing zoo of measures into a more coherent structure."}

Herein, we consider a multistatic configuration where multiple access points (APs) collaboratively illuminate the volume while independently transmitting SSB broadcast signals. Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of voxels within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G SSB burst. To prevent interference between communication and sensing signals, we propose a precoder design that guarantees orthogonality of the sensing beam and the SSB in order to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while ensuring a specified SINR for users, as well as minimizing the impact of the direct link. The results demonstrate that the proposed precoder outperforms the non-coordinated precoder and is minimally affected by variations in drone altitude."}

While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. The results demonstrate that time varying diffusion advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing a realistic foundation for particle based communication in complex flow environments."}

We consider two specific models for side information--a local model where the unknown distribution is in the neighborhood of a known distribution, and a partial ordering model where the alphabet is partitioned into known higher and lower probability sets. In both models, we theoretically characterize the improvement in a suitable squared-error risk because of the available side information. Simulations over natural language and synthetic data illustrate these gains."}

The new boundary points are achieved by a simple coding scheme that employs superposition coding at the transmitter with decode and forward at the stronger receiver. We evaluate our general result for Gaussian BCs and for a BC consisting of a binary erasure channel (BEC) to the stronger receiver and a binary symmetric channel (BSC) to the weaker receiver."}

In this paper, we propose an algebraic construction based on dyadic matrices for designing both classical and quantum LDPC codes. The method first generates classical binary quasi-dyadic LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs have girth 6. It is then extended to the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework, where the two component parity-check matrices are built to satisfy the compatibility condition required by the recently introduced CAMEL-ensemble quaternary belief propagation decoder. This compatibility condition ensures that all unavoidable cycles of length 4 are assembled in a single variable node, allowing the mitigation of their detrimental effects by decimating that variable node."}

In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks."}

More precisely, we have established formula for counting codewords in the linear code C whose i-th coordinate is nonzero. Moreover, we derived a MacWilliam's type identity, relating the normalized support enumerators of a linear code and its dual, explaining how coordinate information transforms under duality. Using this identity we deduce a condition for self duality based on the equality of support distributions. These results provide a more detailed understanding of code structure and complement classical weight based duality theory."}

While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models."}

Learning robust and transferable representations directly from such raw signals, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous communication systems, diverse propagation environments, and limited labeled data. To address this, we present LWM-Spectro, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on large-scale I/Q data represented as time-frequency spectrograms. The model leverages self-supervised masked modeling, contrastive learning, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to learn general-purpose wireless representations. These representations transfer effectively to downstream tasks such as modulation classification and joint SNR/mobility recognition, even with minimal supervision. Across tasks, LWM-Spectro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning baselines in both few-shot and data-rich regimes, providing a unified foundation for wireless learning."}
