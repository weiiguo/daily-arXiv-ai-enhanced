This article proposes a novel\nmethod for the detection of bearing faults and imbalance in induction motors\nusing an antenna as the sensor, which is noninvasive and cost-efficient.\nTime-varying S11 is measured using an omnidirectional antenna, and it is seen\nthat the spectrogram of S11 shows unique characteristics for different fault\nconditions. The experimental setup has analytically evaluated the vibration\nfrequencies due to fault and validated the characteristic fault frequency by\napplying FFT analysis on the captured S11 data. This article has evaluated the\naverage power content of the detected signals at normal and different fault\nconditions. A deep learning model is used to classify the faults based on the\nreflection coefficient ( S11). It is found that classification accuracy of\n98.2% is achieved using both magnitude and phase of S11, 96% using the\nmagnitude of S11 and 92.1% using the phase of S11. The classification accuracy\nfor different operating frequencies, antenna location, and time windows are\nalso investigated."}

Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon\nemissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the\nsignificance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate\nchange, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality\nforest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground\nbiomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the\nleast understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for\naccurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis\nof AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning\ndatasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches\nSVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning\nwere used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable\nselection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning\napproach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results\nindicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum,\nElev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are\nimportant for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index,\ncanopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy\nemerged as the most vital variables.

Such a process is referred\nto as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides\nparameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free\nprocess, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of\nDANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for\nthe state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system\nrenders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics\nof the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed\nat the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a\nreparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the\nsecond-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred\nto as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential\nmeasurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive\nsequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the\nsemi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised\nlearning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system\nas a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation\nperformance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic\nnonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is\nused; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and\nCartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The\nperformance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\\`a-vis particle\nfilters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system."}
