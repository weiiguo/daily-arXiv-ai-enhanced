By leveraging a novel method, we derive exact SEP expressions for a quadrature PSK (QPSK)-modulated n-bit phase-quantized SIMO system with maximum ratio combining (SIMO-MRC), along with the corresponding high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) characterizations in terms of diversity and coding gains. For a QPSK-modulated 2-bit phase-quantized SIMO system with selection combining, the diversity and coding gains are further obtained for an arbitrary number of receive antennas, complementing existing results. Interestingly, the proposed method also reveals a duality between a SIMO-MRC system and a phase-quantized multiple-input single-output (MISO) system with maximum ratio transmission, when the modulation order, phase-quantization resolution, antenna configuration, and the channel state information (CSI) conditions are reciprocal. This duality enables direct inference to obtain the diversity of a general M-PSK-modulated n-bit phase-quantized SIMO-MRC system, and extends the results to its MISO counterpart. All the above results have been obtained assuming perfect CSI at the receiver (CSIR). Finally, the SEP analysis of a QPSK-modulated 2-bit phase-quantized SIMO system is extended to the limited CSIR case, where the CSI at each receive antenna is represented by only 2 bits of channel phase information. In this scenario, the diversity gain is shown to be further halved in general."}

In this regime, signals exhibit spherical wave propagation, unlike the planar waves in conventional far-field systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can dynamically adjust phase shifts to support NFC beamfocusing, concentrating signal energy at specific spatial coordinates. However, effective RIS utilization depends on both rapid channel state information (CSI) estimation and proactive blockage mitigation, which occur on inherently different timescales. CSI varies at millisecond intervals due to small-scale fading, while blockage events evolve over seconds, posing challenges for conventional single-level control algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a dual-transformer (DT) hierarchical framework that integrates two specialized transformer models within a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) architecture, referred to as the DT-HDRL framework. A fast-timescale transformer processes ray-tracing data for rapid CSI estimation, while a vision transformer (ViT) analyzes visual data to predict impending blockages. In HDRL, the high-level controller selects line-of-sight (LoS) or RIS-assisted non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmission paths and sets goals, while the low-level controller optimizes base station (BS) beamfocusing and RIS phase shifts using instantaneous CSI. This dual-timescale coordination maximizes spectral efficiency (SE) while ensuring robust performance under dynamic conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach improves SE by approximately 18% compared to single-timescale baselines, while the proposed blockage predictor achieves an F1-score of 0.92, providing a 769 ms advance warning window in dynamic scenarios."}

To address this gap, we introduce OpenISAC, a versatile and high-performance open-source platform for real-time ISAC experimentation. OpenISAC utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform and implements crucial sensing functionalities, including both monostatic and bistatic delay-Doppler sensing. A key feature of our platform is a novel over-the-air (OTA) synchronization mechanism that enables robust bistatic operations without requiring a wired connection between nodes. The platform is built entirely on open-source software, leveraging the universal software radio peripheral (USRP) hardware driver (UHD) library, thus eliminating the need for any commercial licenses. It supports a wide range of software-defined radios, from the cost-effective USRP B200 series to the high-performance X400 series. The physical layer modulator and demodulator are implemented with C++ for high-speed processing, while the sensing data is streamed to a Python environment, providing a user-friendly interface for rapid prototyping and validation of sensing signal processing algorithms. With flexible parameter selection and real-time communication and sensing operation, OpenISAC serves as a powerful and accessible tool for the academic and research communities to explore and innovate within the field of OFDM-ISAC."}

In this paper, we propose F$^4$-CKM, a novel CKM construction framework characterized by four distinctive features: radiance Field rendering, spatial-Frequency-awareness, location-Free usage, and Fast learning. Central to our design is the adaptation of radiance field rendering techniques from computer vision to the radio frequency (RF) domain, enabled by a novel Wireless Radiator Representation (WiRARE) network that captures the spatial-frequency characteristics of wireless channels.

This paper proposes a semi-blind atomic norm denoising scheme for Zak-OTFS ISAC with bistatic sensing. We first derive the discrete-time input-output (I/O) relationship of Zak-OTFS under fractional delay-Doppler shifts and rectangular windowing. Based on this I/O relation, we formulate the joint channel parameter estimation and data detection task as an atomic norm denoising problem, utilizing the negative square penalty method to handle the non-convex discrete constellation constraints. To solve this problem efficiently, we develop an accelerated iterative algorithm that integrates majorization-minimization, accelerated projected gradient, and inexact accelerated proximal gradient methods.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a new two-stage multi-beam training method with two distinct multi-beam patterns to enable fast and accurate user angle identification. Specifically, in the first stage, the antenna array is divided into sparse subarrays to generate multiple beams (with high array gains), for identifying candidate user angles.

Meanwhile, generic deep network (DN) architectures lack interpretability and require large training data sets to generalize well. In this paper, we therefore propose a lightweight model-aided deep learning architecture based on a greedy selection algorithm for analog beam codewords. The architecture relies on an instance-adaptive augmentation of the signal model to estimate the impact of the CSI error. To learn the DN parameters, we derive a novel and efficient implicit representation of the nested constrained BF problem and prove sufficient conditions for the existence of the corresponding gradient. In the loss function, we utilize an annealing-based approximation of the outage compared to conventional quantile-based loss terms. This approximation adaptively anneals towards the exact probabilistic constraint depending on the current level of quality of service (QoS) violation. Simulations validate that the proposed DN can achieve the nominal outage level under CSI error due to channel estimation and channel compression, while allocating less power than benchmarks. Thereby, a single trained model generalizes to different numbers of users, QoS requirements and levels of CSI quality. We further show that the adaptive annealing-based loss function can accelerate the training and yield a better power-outage trade-off."}

However, the large amount of connected devices prevents the use of orthogonal pilot sequences, resulting in severe pilot contamination (PC) that degrades channel estimation and data detection performance. Furthermore, scalable GF-CF-MaMIMO networks inherently rely on distributed signal processing. In this work, we consider the uplink of a GF-CF-MaMIMO system and propose two novel distributed algorithms for joint activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JACD) based on expectation propagation (EP). The first algorithm, denoted as JACD-EP, uses Gaussian approximations for the channel variables, whereas the second, referred to as JACD-EP-BG, models them as Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) random variables. To integrate the BG distribution into the EP framework, we derive its exponential family representation and develop the two algorithms as efficient message passing over a factor graph constructed from the a posteriori probability (APP) distribution. The proposed framework is inherently scalable with respect to both the number of access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs). Simulation results show the efficient mitigation of PC by the proposed distributed algorithms and their superior detection accuracy compared to (genie-aided) centralized linear detectors."}
