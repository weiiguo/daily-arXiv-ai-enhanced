Given only the sensitivity of a query and a norm-monotone cost function measuring utility loss, we ask which noise distribution minimizes expected cost among all additive $ε$-DP mechanisms. Using convex rearrangement theory, we show that this infinite-dimensional optimization problem admits a reduction to a one-dimensional compact and convex family of radially symmetric distributions whose extreme points are the staircase distributions. As a consequence, we prove that for any dimension, any norm, and any norm-monotone cost function, there exists an $ε$-DP staircase mechanism that is optimal among all additive mechanisms. This result resolves a conjecture of Geng, Kairouz, Oh, and Viswanath, and provides a geometric explanation for the emergence of staircase mechanisms as extremal solutions in differential privacy."}

Inf. Theory", "summary": "This paper addresses the estimation of signals with sublinear sparsity sent over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. This fundamental problem arises in designing denoisers used in message-passing algorithms for sublinear sparsity. The main results are direct and converse theorems in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity grows sublinearly in the signal dimension as the signal dimension tends to infinity. As a direct theorem, the maximum likelihood estimator is proved to achieve vanishing square error in the sublinear sparsity limit if the noise variance is smaller than a threshold. As a converse theorem, all estimators cannot achieve square errors smaller than the signal power under a mild condition if the noise variance is larger than another threshold. In particular, the two thresholds coincide with each other when non-zero signals have constant amplitude. These results imply the asymptotic optimality of an existing separable Bayesian estimator used in approximate message-passing for sublinear sparsity."}

A $(t,s)$-BRC guarantees correct decoding of the original message even after up to~$t$ arbitrary breaks of the codeword and the complete loss of some fragments whose total length is at most~$s$. This model unifies and generalizes previous approaches, extending break-resilient codes (which handle arbitrary fragmentation without fragment loss) and deletion codes (which correct bit losses in unknown positions without fragmentation) into a single information-theoretic framework.

We consider a practical scenario where the transmitter operates with imperfect eavesdropper channel state information (ECSI), knowing only the instantaneous line-of-sight (LoS) component and the statistical properties of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) component. To rigorously quantify secrecy performance under the ECSI uncertainty, we adopt the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) as the metric. Since deriving an exact analytical expression for the ESR is intractable, we leverage random matrix theory to derive a deterministic equivalent. This avoids heavy Monte Carlo simulations and also provides explicit insights into the effects of channel spatial statistics on secrecy performance. Building upon the deterministic equivalent, we formulate a joint maximization problem for the transmit precoding matrix and the antenna positions at the legitimate transmitter. To tackle the non-convexity of this optimization problem, we develop a comprehensive alternating optimization framework. Specifically, the precoding matrix is optimized via a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, where the gradient is computed by solving an implicit fixed-point equation. For the antenna position optimization, the complexity of the objective function prevents the construction of standard MM surrogate. To this end, we further propose a novel AMSGrad-based surrogate function that relies solely on gradient information. We provide a rigorous theoretical proof that guarantees the convergence of this proposed algorithm despite relaxing the strict majorization conditions."}

This work presents a first-principles framework inherent to Bayesian updating, termed information mechanics (infomechanics). Any pointwise reduction in posterior surprisal is exactly balanced by information gained from data, independently of algorithms, dynamics, or implementation. Imposing additivity, symmetry, and robustness collapses the freedom of this identity to only two independent conservation relations. One governs the global redistribution of uncertainty and recovers Shannon entropy. The other captures a complementary local geometric component, formalised as Fisher information. Together, these conserved quantities motivate a non-additive state function, the information potential $Φ$, which isolates structural degrees of freedom beyond entropy while remaining invariant under reparametrisation. $Φ$ quantifies local sharpness and ruggedness in posterior beliefs and vanishes uniquely for isotropic Gaussian distributions. In a low-temperature regime, $Φ$ scales logarithmically with the effective number of local optima, linking information geometry to computational complexity. This formalises an information-computation exchange, whereby information acquisition reshapes the inference landscape and reduces computational demands. By separating invariant informational constraints from inference mechanisms, this framework provides a unified, algorithm-independent foundation for inference, learning, and computation across biological and artificial systems."}

Nevertheless, existing wireless systems, particularly at the physical layer waveform level, remain inadequate for achieving the ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) envisioned for 6G. Specifically, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the widely adopted waveform in fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) networks, suffers from inherent limitations in satisfying these stringent requirements. In practice, OFDM can experience severe inter-carrier interference (ICI), resulting in a pronounced data rate error floor caused by high Doppler shifts. Additionally, the repetitive usage of cyclic prefixes (CPs), intended to combat multipath delays, results in significant spectral inefficiency. These fundamental drawbacks pose critical obstacles to fulfilling 6G performance objectives. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as a promising waveform candidate, addressing the aforementioned challenges by exploiting the unique characteristics of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel. Unlike OFDM, OTFS is inherently resilient to channel distortions induced by delay and Doppler effects, while remaining sensitive to time and frequency shifts. Such intrinsic properties are instrumental in enabling OTFS, with joint communication and sensing capabilities, to embrace, rather than combat, dynamic channel conditions. Motivated by these compelling advantages, this article investigates the feasibility and practical implementation of OTFS modulation leveraging the current OFDM-based wireless systems."}

One such impairment is sampling jitter (SJ), which arises due to imperfections in the sampling instants of the clocks of digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). While SJ is already well studied for communication systems based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which is expected to be the waveform of choice for most sixth-generation (6G) scenarios where ISAC could be possible, the implications of SJ on the OFDM-based radar sensing must still be thoroughly analyzed. Considering that phase-locked loop (PLL)-based oscillators are used to derive sampling clocks, which leads to colored SJ, i.e., SJ with non-flat power spectral density, this article analyzes the resulting distortion of the adopted digital constellation modulation and sensing performance in OFDM-based ISAC for both baseband (BB) and bandpass (BP) sampling strategies and different oversampling factors. For BB sampling, it is seen that SJ induces intercarrier interference (ICI), while for BP sampling, it causes carrier phase error and more severe ICI due to a phase noise-like effect at the digital intermediate frequency. Obtained results for a single-input single-output OFDM-based ISAC system with various OFDM signal parameterizations demonstrate that SJ-induced degradation becomes non-negligible for both BB and BP sampling only for root mean square (RMS) SJ values above 10^-11 s at both DAC and ADC, which corresponds to 0.5*10^-2 times the considered critical sampling period without oversampling. Based on the achieved results, it can be concluded that state-of-the-art hardware enables sufficient communication and sensing robustness against SJ, as RMS SJ values in the femtosecond range can be achieved."}

The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the coordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via treating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate domain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and track the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication receiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and LoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath channel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain (B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a priori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated to establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on the angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and propose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to minimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking accuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance.

Yet, most neural attention tracking studies are still limited to highly controlled lab settings, using clean, often audio-only stimuli and requiring sustained attention to a single talker. This work addresses that gap by introducing a novel dataset from 24 normal-hearing participants. We used a mobile electroencephalography (EEG) system (44 scalp electrodes and 20 cEEGrid electrodes) in an audiovisual (AV) paradigm with three conditions: sustained attention to a single talker in a two-talker environment, attention switching between two talkers, and unscripted two-talker conversations with a competing single talker. Analysis included temporal response functions (TRFs) modeling, optimal lag analysis, selective attention classification with decision windows ranging from 1.1s to 35s, and comparisons of TRFs for attention to AV conversations versus side audio-only talkers. Key findings show significant differences in the attention-related P2-peak between attended and ignored speech across conditions for scalp EEG. No significant change in performance between switching and sustained attention suggests robustness for attention switches. Optimal lag analysis revealed narrower peak for conversation compared to single-talker AV stimuli, reflecting the additional complexity of multi-talker processing. Classification of selective attention was consistently above chance (55-70% accuracy) for scalp EEG, while cEEGrid data yielded lower correlations, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements. These results demonstrate that mobile EEG can reliably track selective attention in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios and provide guidance for designing future AV paradigms and real-world attention tracking applications."}

In active sensing applications, such as radar, sonar, wireless communications, and medical ultrasound, a collection of sensors probes the environment by emitting self-generated energy. A key benefit of such active multi-sensor arrays is their ability to focus and steer energy in desired directions by beamforming on transmit. Sparse sensor arrays offer several advantages over conventional uniform arrays, including improved resolution using fewer physical sensors and the capability to identify more scatterers than sensors. This is facilitated by the effective transmit-receive virtual array known as the sum co-array, which can have many more virtual sensors than the number of physical transmit or receive sensors. Herein, we focus on the design of low-redundancy sparse array configurations and on employing transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) beamforming using sparse arrays. We discuss the optimal, but computationally intractable Minimum-redundancy array, and a scalable symmetric array framework, which extends many well-known passive sparse array geometries to the active case. We also examine mitigating side lobes arising from spatial undersampling by a synthetic beamforming method known as image addition. We briefly present approaches for finding the physical beamforming weights synthesizing a desired Tx-Rx beampattern, and consider related spatio-temporal trade-offs. We conclude by discussing selected applications of sparse arrays in active sensing."}

While the main goal of ISAC in standardization efforts is to detect objects, the byproducts of radar operations can be used to enable new services in 6G, such as weather sensing. Even though weather radars are the most prominent technology for weather detection and monitoring, they are expensive and usually neglect areas in close vicinity. To this end, we propose reusing the dense deployment of 6G base stations for weather sensing purposes by detecting and estimating weather conditions. We implement both a classifier and a regressor as a convolutional neural network trained across measurements with varying precipitation rates and wind speeds. We implement our approach in an ISAC proof-of-concept, and conduct a multi-week experiment campaign. Experimental results show that we are able to jointly and accurately classify weather conditions with accuracies of 99.38% and 98.99% for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. For estimation, we obtain errors of 1.2 mm/h and 1.5 km/h, for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. These findings indicate that weather sensing services can be reliably deployed in 6G ISAC networks, broadening their service portfolio and boosting their market value."}
