However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs:\nsome achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding\nspeed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch\ncomplicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance\nmetrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires\nboth compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present\na mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and\ndecoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and\nbalances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling\nobjective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments\non image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably\nidentifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings.\nResults also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide\nsuperior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when\nspeed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable\ndecision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression\ntechniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs."}

Specifically, the LTE\nbase stations (BSs) are exploited as signal illuminators, and three passive\nsensing receivers are deployed at different locations to detect the bistatic\nDoppler frequencies of a target drone from received downlink signals. It is\nshown that even without the measurements of BS-drone-receiver range and angle,\nthe Doppler measurements could provide sufficient information for trajectory\ntracking. Particularly, the trajectory of the target drone, consisting of the\ninitial position and velocities of all the time slots, can be reconstructed by\nsolving a minimum mean-squared error problem according to the above Doppler\nmeasurements. It is demonstrated by experiment that although the target drone\nand all the sensing receivers are around 200 meters away from the illuminating\nBSs, the complicated trajectories can be tracked with 90% errors below 90\ncentimeters. Since this accuracy is notably higher than the typical range\nresolution of LTE signals, the demonstration shows that drone trajectory\ntracking with a high accuracy could be feasible solely according to Doppler\ndetection, as long as the deployment density of receivers is sufficiently high."}

A systematic study was conducted by\nSadeh, Gu, and Tamo, where each file is replicated across two servers and the\nstorage topology is modeled by a graph. The PIR capacity of a graph $G$,\ndenoted by $\\mathcal{C}(G)$, is defined as the supremum of retrieval rates\nachievable by schemes that preserve user privacy, with the rate measured as the\nratio between the file size and the total number of bits downloaded. This paper\nmakes the following key contributions.\n  (1) The complete graph $K_N$ has emerged as a central benchmark in the study\nof PIR over graphs. The asymptotic gap between the upper and lower bounds for\n$\\mathcal{C}(K_N)$ was previously 2 and was only recently reduced to $5/3$. We\nshrink this gap to $1.0444$, bringing it close to resolution. More precisely,\n  (i) Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo proved that $\\mathcal{C}(K_N)\\le 2/(N+1)$ and\nconjectured this bound to be tight. We refute this conjecture by establishing\nthe strictly stronger bound $\\mathcal{C}(K_N) \\le \\frac{1.3922}{N}.$ We also\nimprove the upper bound for the balanced complete bipartite graph\n$\\mathcal{C}(K_{N/2,N/2})$. (ii) The first lower bound on $\\mathcal{C}(K_N)$\nwas $(1+o(1))/N$, which was recently sharpened to $(6/5+o(1))/N$. We provide\nexplicit, systematic constructions that further improve this bound, proving\n$\\mathcal{C}(K_N)\\ge(4/3-o(1))/N,$ which in particular implies $\\mathcal{C}(G)\n\\ge (4/3-o(1))/|G|$ for every graph $G$.\n  (2) We establish a conceptual bridge between deterministic and probabilistic\nPIR schemes on graphs. This connection has significant implications for\nreducing the required subpacketization in practical implementations and is of\nindependent interest. We also design a general probabilistic PIR scheme that\nperforms particularly well on sparse graphs."}

While data-driven approaches have shown\npromise, traditional supervised learning methods rely on extensive labeled\ndatasets, which are often impractical to obtain for damaged structures. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a physics-informed multi-source domain\nadaptation framework to predict post-earthquake structural damage for a target\nbuilding without requiring damage labels. The multi-source domain integrates\nactual damage data and numerical modeling data from buildings similar to the\ntarget structure. The framework operates through three key steps. First, the\nsimilarity of key physics from each domain are analyzed to form a weight\nmatrix, which enhances domain differentiation. Second, features from the\nmulti-source and target domains are extracted and fed into a classifier and a\ndiscriminator. The classifier ensures that the features are damage-sensitive\nand accurately assign damage states, while the discriminator enforces that the\nfeatures remain domain-invariant. Finally, the key parameters matrix is applied\nas weights during adversarial training to optimize the contribution of features\nfrom each source domain. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for\nassessing structural damage in scenarios where labeled data is scarce,\nsignificantly advancing the capabilities of post-earthquake damage evaluation."}

A recent example of such sharing,\nbetween commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where\nunlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor\nincumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no\nreliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or\noutdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor\naccess points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and\nreducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate\nindoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling\nautomatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To\nthis end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for\nI/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and\nhighly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and\ndistinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various\nmethodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning\napproaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse\ngeographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone\ncan achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi)\ndata, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of\nGNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy,\nshowcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion."}
