### [1] [On the performance of Active STAR-RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with Phase Errors and Channel Aging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13171)
*Jun Qian,Ross Murch,Khaled B. Letaief*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文分析了主动可重构智能表面在cell-free大规模MIMO系统中的性能，重点研究了相位误差和信道老化对系统的影响，并提出了资源块长度设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 利用空间相关瑞利衰落模型，推导基于最小均方误差估计的信道估计，并制定下行链路频谱效率的闭式表达式，评估信道老化和均匀分布相位误差的影响。

Result: 结果表明主动STAR-RIS能有效补偿相位误差和信道老化的不利影响，增加AP和STAR-RIS元素数量以及更大的放大因子可以缓解性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出了资源块长度设计的实用指南，主动STAR-RIS是应对相位误差和信道老化问题的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) employ amplification to
overcome attenuation caused by the RIS cascaded link. In this paper, we analyze
the effects of phase errors and channel aging in active simultaneously
transmitting and reflecting (STAR) RIS-assisted cell-free massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. By leveraging a spatially
correlated Rayleigh fading model, this paper derives minimum mean square error
estimate-based channel estimates and formulates closed-form expressions for
downlink spectral efficiency. This analytical framework enables a comprehensive
evaluation of the effects of channel aging and uniformly distributed phase
errors on system performance. The results demonstrate that active STAR-RISs can
effectively compensate for the adverse effects of phase errors and channel
aging. To counteract the impact of channel aging, we propose practical
guidelines for resource-block-length design. Also, an increase in APs and
STAR-RIS elements, along with a larger amplification factor, can alleviate
performance degradation.

### [2] [A Dimension-Keeping Semi-Tensor Product Framework for Compressed Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13180)
*Qi Qi,Abdelhamid Tayebi,Daizhan Cheng,Jun-e Feng*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的维度保持半张量积压缩感知方法(DK-STP-CS)，通过利用组内相关性同时保持组间不相干性来增强测量矩阵设计，在图像压缩重建中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩感知框架依赖测量矩阵列的不相干性来保证重建性能，但未能充分利用信号的结构特性。本文旨在通过利用组内相关性同时保持组间不相干性来改进测量矩阵设计。

Method: 将DK-STP算法集成到感知矩阵设计中，实现降维同时保持信号恢复能力，利用组内相关性增强测量效率。

Result: 实验结果表明DK-STP-CS在图像压缩重建任务中显著优于传统CS和STP-CS方法，具有更高的PSNR值，在噪声环境和不同采样率下表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DK-STP-CS方法在资源受限环境中具有实际应用潜力，能够有效抑制噪声并提高视觉保真度。

Abstract: In compressed sensing (CS), sparse signals can be reconstructed from
significantly fewer samples than required by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling
theorem. While non-sparse signals can be sparsely represented in appropriate
transformation domains, conventional CS frameworks rely on the incoherence of
the measurement matrix columns to guarantee reconstruction performance. This
paper proposes a novel method termed Dimension-Keeping Semi-Tensor Product
Compressed Sensing (DK-STP-CS), which leverages intra-group correlations while
maintaining inter-group incoherence to enhance the measurement matrix design.
Specifically, the DK-STP algorithm is integrated into the design of the sensing
matrix, enabling dimensionality reduction while preserving signal recovery
capability. For image compression and reconstruction tasks, the proposed method
achieves notable noise suppression and improves visual fidelity. Experimental
results demonstrate that DK-STP-CS significantly outperforms traditional CS and
STP-CS approaches, as evidenced by higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
values between the reconstructed and original images. The robustness of
DK-STP-CS is further validated under noisy conditions and varying sampling
rates, highlighting its potential for practical applications in
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 脏纸编码非线性预编码是提升6G近场通信系统性能的有效方法，特别适用于用户密集场景

Abstract: In 6G systems, extremely large-scale antenna arrays operating at terahertz
frequencies extend the near-field region to typical user distances from the
base station, enabling near-field communication (NFC) with fine spatial
resolution through beamfocusing. Existing multiuser NFC systems predominantly
employ linear precoding techniques such as zero-forcing (ZF), which suffer from
performance degradation due to the high transmit power required to suppress
interference. This paper proposes a nonlinear precoding framework based on
Dirty Paper Coding (DPC), which pre-cancels known interference to maximize the
sum-rate performance. We formulate and solve the corresponding sum-rate
maximization problems, deriving optimal power allocation strategies for both
DPC and ZF schemes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DPC achieves
substantial sum-rate gains over ZF across various near-field configurations,
with the most pronounced improvements observed for closely spaced users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献通常忽略脉冲成形、上变频、混频、载波同步和符号定时同步等操作，这些假设在大多数情况下足够，但要准确模拟中频无线通信，需要详细模拟某些物理层操作。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the necessary procedures for accurately simulating
digital wireless communication systems operating in the mediumband, aimed at
both beginners and experts. In the research literature, digital wireless
communication systems are typically simulated in the discrete-time complex
baseband domain, where pulse shaping, upconversion, mixing, carrier
synchronization, and symbol timing synchronization are often ignored. These
assumptions are indeed sufficient in most cases, but to capture the essence of
communication in the mediumband, certain physical layer (PHY) operations should
be simulated in detail. In this paper, we concisely describe how to simulate a
mediumband wireless communication scenario from a single transmitter (TX) to a
single receiver (RX) in MATLAB, elaborating the operation of key PHY
subsystems. The approach described here ensures that the simulated system
captures the delicate dynamics of mediumband wireless communication, including
the effect of deep fading avoidance.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过详细分析和数值说明证明了其有效性，适用于通用多模信道和典型二进制对称窃听信道。

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology based on Euclidean information theory to
investigate local properties of secure communication over discrete memoryless
wiretap channels. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that
maximizes a legitimate user's information rate while imposing explicit upper
bounds on both the information leakage to an eavesdropper and the informational
cost of encoding the secret message. By leveraging local geometric
approximations, this inherently non-convex problem is transformed into a
tractable quadratic programming structure. It is demonstrated that the optimal
Lagrange multipliers governing this approximated problem can be found by
solving a linear program. The constraints of this linear program are derived
from Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and are expressed in terms of the
generalized eigenvalues of channel-derived matrices. This framework facilitates
the derivation of an analytical formula for an approximate local secrecy
capacity. Furthermore, we define and analyze a new class of secret local
contraction coefficients. These coefficients, characterized as the largest
generalized eigenvalues of a matrix pencil, quantify the maximum achievable
ratio of approximate utility to approximate leakage, thus measuring the
intrinsic local leakage efficiency of the channel. We establish bounds
connecting these local coefficients to their global counterparts defined over
true mutual information measures. The efficacy of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through detailed analysis and numerical illustrations for both
general multi-mode channels and the canonical binary symmetric wiretap channel.

### [7] [Combinatorial Bounds for List Recovery via Discrete Brascamp--Lieb Inequalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13775)
*Joshua Brakensiek,Yeyuan Chen,Manik Dhar,Zihan Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了列表恢复问题的新组合边界，证明了当接近容量时，列表大小L最多为(ℓ/(R+ε))^{O(R/ε)}，解决了L是否能被ℓ的多项式界定的长期开放问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决列表恢复问题中关于列表大小L是否能被ℓ的多项式界定的长期开放问题，特别是在接近容量时的情况。

Method: 应用离散熵Brascamp-Lieb不等式到列表恢复问题，将每个坐标的局部结构与恢复列表的全局结构联系起来。

Result: 对于随机线性码、随机Reed-Solomon码、显式折叠Reed-Solomon码和显式单变量重数码，当ρ=1-R-ε接近容量时，列表大小L最多为(ℓ/(R+ε))^{O(R/ε)}。

Conclusion: 证明了列表大小L可以被ℓ的多项式界定，在零误差情况下与已知下界完美匹配，并推广了Chen和Zhang的结果为新的Brascamp-Lieb类型不等式。

Abstract: In coding theory, the problem of list recovery asks one to find all codewords
$c$ of a given code $C$ which such that at least $1-\rho$ fraction of the
symbols of $c$ lie in some predetermined set of $\ell$ symbols for each
coordinate of the code. A key question is bounding the maximum possible list
size $L$ of such codewords for the given code $C$.
  In this paper, we give novel combinatorial bounds on the list recoverability
of various families of linear and folded linear codes, including random linear
codes, random Reed--Solomon codes, explicit folded Reed--Solomon codes, and
explicit univariate multiplicity codes. Our main result is that in all of these
settings, we show that for code of rate $R$, when $\rho = 1 - R - \epsilon$
approaches capacity, the list size $L$ is at most
$(\ell/(R+\epsilon))^{O(R/\epsilon)}$. These results also apply in the
average-radius regime. Our result resolves a long-standing open question on
whether $L$ can be bounded by a polynomial in $\ell$. In the zero-error regime,
our bound on $L$ perfectly matches known lower bounds.
  The primary technique is a novel application of a discrete entropic
Brascamp--Lieb inequality to the problem of list recovery, allowing us to
relate the local structure of each coordinate with the global structure of the
recovered list. As a result of independent interest, we show that a recent
result by Chen and Zhang (STOC 2025) on the list decodability of folded
Reed--Solomon codes can be generalized into a novel Brascamp--Lieb type
inequality.

### [8] [From Random to Explicit via Subspace Designs With Applications to Local Properties and Matroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13777)

Conclusion: 子空间可设计码与随机线性码在局部性质上等价，这一结果为编码理论和拟阵理论提供了新的联系和应用。

Abstract: In coding theory, a common question is to understand the threshold rates of
various local properties of codes, such as their list decodability and list
recoverability. A recent work Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya (FOCS 2025) gave
a novel unified framework for calculating the threshold rates of local
properties for random linear and random Reed--Solomon codes.
  In this paper, we extend their framework to studying the local properties of
subspace designable codes, including explicit folded Reed-Solomon and
univariate multiplicity codes. Our first main result is a local equivalence
between random linear codes and (nearly) optimal subspace design codes up to an
arbitrarily small rate decrease. We show any local property of random linear
codes applies to all subspace design codes. As such, we give the first explicit
construction of folded linear codes that simultaneously attain all local
properties of random linear codes. Conversely, we show that any local property
which applies to all subspace design codes also applies to random linear codes.
  Our second main result is an application to matroid theory. We show that the
correctable erasure patterns in a maximally recoverable tensor code can be
identified in deterministic polynomial time, assuming a positive answer to a
matroid-theoretic question due to Mason (1981). This improves on a result of
Jackson and Tanigawa (JCTB 2024) who gave a complexity characterization of
$\mathsf{RP} \cap \mathsf{coNP}$ assuming a stronger conjecture. Our result
also applies to the generic bipartite rigidity and matrix completion matroids.
  As a result of additional interest, we study the existence and limitations of
subspace designs. In particular, we tighten the analysis of family of subspace
designs constructioned by Guruswami and Kopparty (Combinatorica 2016) and show
that better subspace designs do not exist over algebraically closed fields.

### [9] [Effective Connectivity-Based Unsupervised Channel Selection Method for EEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12910)

Result: 在三个EEG数据集上，方法分别使用13/22、29/59、48/118个通道，达到了82%、86.01%、87.56%的最高准确率，显著减少了电极数量并提高了性能。

Conclusion: 基于有效连接性的无监督通道选择方法能够有效识别最相关的脑电通道，在保持或提高分类性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Analyzing neural data such as Electroencephalography (EEG) data often
involves dealing with high-dimensional datasets, where not all channels provide
equally meaningful informa- tion. Selecting the most relevant channels is
crucial for improving computational efficiency and ensuring robust insights
into neural dynamics. This study introduces the Importance of Channels based on
Effective Connectivity (ICEC) criterion for quantifying effective connectivity
(EC) in each channel. Effective connectivity refers to the causal influence one
neural region exerts over another, providing insights into the directional flow
of information. Using this criterion, we propose an unsupervised channel
selection method that accounts for the intensity of interactions among
channels. To evaluate the proposed channel selection method, we applied it to
three well-known EEG datasets across four categories. The assessment involved
calculating the ICEC criterion using five effective connectivity metrics:
partial directed coherence (PDC), generalized PDC (GPDC), renormalized PDC
(RPDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and direct DTF (dDTF). To focus on
the effect of channel selection, we employed the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)
algorithm for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for
classification across all participants. Results were compared with other
CSP-based methods. The evaluation included comparing participant- specific
accuracies with and without the proposed method across five effective
connectivity metrics. The results showed consistent performance improvements
and a significant reduction in the number of selected electrodes for all
participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieved the
highest accuracies: 82% (13 out of 22 channels), 86.01% (29 out of 59
channels), and 87.56% (48 out of 118 channels) across three datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ISAC系统中的自干扰问题，为单站带内全双工系统提供了实用的干扰消除解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in monostatic in-band full-duplex
(IBFD) systems encounters significant challenges due to self-interference (SI)
at the radar receiver during concurrent communication and radar operations.
This paper proposes a novel waveform-domain self-interference cancellation
(SIC) technique that leverages the unique properties of orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM)
signals. The proposed approach designs the integrated dual-functionality frame
to utilize OFDM for communication and AFDM for radar sensing, both generated
using the same modulator block. Then, we establish the conditions under which a
wide sense stationary (WSS) process in the time domain appears as WSS in the
affine domain and demonstrate that the interfering OFDM signal behaves as an
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in this domain. Exploiting this property,
the received signal is projected into the affine domain, where the SI appears
as AWGN, enabling its subtraction with minimal residual interference. To
further mitigate the residual SI, an iterative low-complexity windowing scheme
is applied, selectively locking onto the radar signal to reduce the processed
signal space. A subsequent time-domain spreading step is applied after
converting the SIC-processed signal into the post-coded time domain, wherein
the SI diminishes separately across the delay and Doppler axes. The proposed
method demonstrates superior performance in terms of detection probability,
target range and velocity root mean square error (RMSE), while maintaining high
spectral efficiency and minimal computational complexity.

Abstract: We present an approach to identifying wireless microwave tags using radio
frequency (RF) fingerprinting and machine learning. The tags are designed for
low cost and simplicity, consisting of only two antennas and a single nonlinear
element (a diode). An interrogating transceiver transmits a signal consisting
of a set of individual frequency tones that is captured by the tag. The signal
response of the diode is nonlinear, and can be represented by an infinite power
series, the coefficients of which are similar but not identical for different
physical diodes due to small manufacturing perturbations. The small differences
in the signal responses manifest in the spectral signal response of the tag,
which is retransmitted back to the interrogating transceiver. Input into
machine learning algorithms, the slight differences in the spectral responses
of the diodes can be used to uniquely identify devices. To demonstrate the
concept, we designed 2.0 GHz tags consisting of patch antennas and a single
diode, along with a bi-static radar system operating at the 2.0 GHz 802.11
Wi-Fi band transmitting multi-tone continuous wave signals representing common
802.11 training fields. The received signals were processed using a set of
algorithms for comparison purposes. A real-time classification accuracy of 95%
between two tags was achieved.

Abstract: Deep learning-based neural receivers are redefining physical-layer signal
processing for next-generation wireless systems. We propose an axial
self-attention transformer neural receiver designed for applicability to 6G and
beyond wireless systems, validated through 5G-compliant experimental
configurations, that achieves state-of-the-art block error rate (BLER)
performance with significantly improved computational efficiency. By
factorizing attention operations along temporal and spectral axes, the proposed
architecture reduces the quadratic complexity of conventional multi-head
self-attention from $O((TF)^2)$ to $O(T^2F+TF^2)$, yielding substantially fewer
total floating-point operations and attention matrix multiplications per
transformer block compared to global self-attention. Relative to convolutional
neural receiver baselines, the axial neural receiver achieves significantly
lower computational cost with a fraction of the parameters. Experimental
validation under 3GPP Clustered Delay Line (CDL) channels demonstrates
consistent performance gains across varying mobility scenarios. Under
non-line-of-sight CDL-C conditions, the axial neural receiver consistently
outperforms all evaluated receiver architectures, including global
self-attention, convolutional neural receivers, and traditional LS-LMMSE at
10\% BLER with reduced computational complexity per inference. At stringent
reliability targets of 1\% BLER, the axial receiver maintains robust symbol
detection at high user speeds, whereas the traditional LS-LMMSE receiver fails
to converge, underscoring its suitability for ultra-reliable low-latency
(URLLC) communication in dynamic 6G environments and beyond. These results
establish the axial neural receiver as a structured, scalable, and efficient
framework for AI-Native 6G RAN systems, enabling deployment in
resource-constrained edge environments.

Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is one of the most widely
adopted waveforms for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems,
owing to its high spectral efficiency and compatibility with modern
communication standards. This paper investigates the sensing performance of
OFDM-based ISAC for multi-target delay (range) estimation under specific radar
receiver processing schemes. An estimation-theoretic framework is developed to
characterize sensing performance with random communication payloads. We
establish the fundamental limit of delay estimation accuracy by deriving the
closed-form expression of the mean-square error (MSE) achieved using matched
filtering (MF) and reciprocal filtering (RF) receivers. The results show that,
in multi-target scenarios, the impact of signal constellations on the delay
estimation MSE differs across receivers: MF performance depends on the
fourth-order moment of the zero-mean, unit-power constellation in the presence
of multiple targets, whereas RF performance depends on its inverse second-order
moment, irrespective of the number of targets. Building on this analysis, we
present a ISAC constellation design under specific receiver architecture that
brings a receiver-dependent flexible trade-off between sensing and
communication in OFDM-ISAC systems. The theoretical findings are validated
through simulations and proof-of-concept experiments, and also the sensing and
communication performance trade-off is experimentally shown with the proposed
constellation design.

Abstract: Background: Dementia, particularly Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is a progressive
neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline. Early detection,
especially at the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage, is essential for
timely intervention. Working Memory (WM) impairment is a key early indicator of
neurodegeneration, affecting higher cognitive processes. Electroencephalography
(EEG), with its high temporal resolution, offers a cost-effective method to
assess brain dynamics. This study investigates WM-related EEG functional
connectivity (FC) to identify brain network alterations across dementia stages.
Methods: EEG signals were recorded from 24 participants (8 AD, 8 MCI, and 8
healthy controls) during WM tasks, including encoding, recall, and retrieval
stages. Data preprocessing involved noise reduction and feature extraction
using Spherical and Head Harmonic Decomposition (SHD, HHD). FC was quantified
using Cross-Plot Transition Entropy (CPTE) and Phase Lag Index (PLI). Network
metrics such as Degree and Eigenvector Centrality were analyzed using Support
Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers. Results: The CPTE-based
connectivity metrics outperformed the traditional PLI approach in
differentiating dementia stages, attaining a peak classification accuracy of
97.53% during the retrieval phase with the Random Forest model. A connectivity
threshold of 0.5 was optimal for network discrimination. SHD and HHD features
also demonstrated strong discriminative potential. AD subjects exhibited higher
synchronization patterns during WM tasks than healthy controls. Conclusions:
The integration of WM tasks with EEG-based FC analysis provides a robust
framework for dementia classification. The proposed CPTE-based approach offers
a robust, scalable, non-invasive, and effective diagnostic tool for early
detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: We observed synchronization mismatches in the form of non-smooth phase
progressions and drifts within mobile multisensor channel sounding
measurements. However, performing Doppler estimation in a distributed
multisensor integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system requires
coherence among the nodes, which implies a continuously differentiable phase
progression of the received signals. To correct the sounding data in
post-processing, we extend traditional geometry-based drift compensation
algorithms by utilizing Kalman filtering for line-of-sight (LoS) tracking,
which improves the robustness of the LoS estimate in multipath scenarios. This
approach smooths the phase progression and enables the correction of
time-varying drifts while preserving relative sensor motion. Furthermore, we
propose using the relative residual power after high-resolution parameter
estimation (HRPE) as a metric for ground-truth-independent comparison of
post-processing synchronization methods for recorded channel sounding data.
Results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional LoS estimation
heuristics, reducing the relative residual power by more than 5 dB and the
delay-Doppler estimate root mean square errors (RMSEs) by approximately 60 %.

Abstract: Recent advancements in polymer microwave fiber (PMF) technology have created
significant opportunities for robust, low-cost, and high-speed sub-terahertz
(THz) radio-over- fiber communications. Recognizing these potential benefits,
this paper explores a novel radio-over-fiber (RoF) structure that interconnects
multiple radio units (RUs) in cascade via fiber, envi- sioning its application
in indoor scenarios. This structure creates a number of research opportunities
when considering cascaded distortion effects introduced by non-linear power
amplifiers (PAs) at the RUs and the propagation channel over the fiber. We
propose maximum-likelihood and non-linear least-squares algorithms to estimate
the propagation distance along the RoF and the time-of-arrival between the RoF
and the user equipment. For the case of linear PAs, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao
lower bound to benchmark the performance of the estimators. Finally, we
investigate the use of the system for uplink positioning. Our simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform satisfactorily even
with the cascaded effects of non- linear PAs, and that the deployment of this
RoF structure can enable new cost-effective opportunities for high-resolution
positioning in indoor scenarios. In the numerical evaluation, we also use
measured PMF characteristics for high-density polyethylene fibers.

Abstract: For the problem of source localization, three elements usually play a very
important role in accurate localization. They are the range measurements, the
angle measurements and the least absolute deviation criterion, which is
regarded as a robust metric for denoising the measurements. Building the three
elements into a computationally tractable model is challenging. In this paper,
we introduce a robust Euclidean Distance Matrix (EDM) optimization model that
simultaneously incorporates the three elements. For the first time, we show
that for the case of 3D single-source localization (3DSSL), the angle
measurements can be represented as a simple box constraint of distances. It is
achieved by reducing each of the 3D angle measurements to a two-dimensional
nonlinear optimization problem, whose global minimum and maximum solutions can
be characterized and utilized to get the lower and upper bounds of the
distances from the unknown source to the sensors. We further develop an
efficient algorithm. The high quality of the localization by the new EDM model
is assessed through extensive numerical experiments in comparison with leading
solvers for 3DSSL.
