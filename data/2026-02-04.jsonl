Virtual antenna array (VAA) techniques enable DoA estimation with a single antenna, making angle estimation feasible on such devices. However, BLE only provides a single-shot two-way channel frequency response (CFR) with a binary phase ambiguity issue, which hinders the direct application of VAA. To address this challenge, we propose a unified model that combines VAA with BLE two-way CFR, and introduce a neural network based phase recovery framework that employs row / column predictors with a voting mechanism to resolve the ambiguity. The recovered one-way CFR then enables super resolution algorithms such as MUSIC for joint time of arrival (ToA) and DoA estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under non-uniform VAAs, with mean square errors approaching the Cramer Rao bound at SNR $\\geq$ 5 dB."}

We develop an acquisition and demodulation framework to decode Starlink frames and disclose the explicit sequences of the edge pilots -- bands of 4QAM symbols located at both edges of each Starlink channel that apparently repeat identically across all frames, beams, channels, and satellites. We further reveal that the great majority of QPSK-modulated symbols do not carry high-entropy user data but instead follow a regular tessellated structure superimposed on a constant reference template. We demonstrate that exploiting frame-level predictable elements yields a processing gain of approximately 48 dB, thereby enabling low-cost, compact receivers to extract precise TOA measurements even from low-SNR Starlink side beams."}

By enabling simultaneous transmission and reflection, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) can support full-space angle detection. This paper develops a fullspace angle estimation framework by leveraging a finite rate of innovation (FRI) model enabled by STAR-RIS. We distinguish two practical STAR-RIS configurations: (i) an element-wise uniform setting, where all metasurface elements share identical energy-splitting (ES) coefficients and phase differences, and (ii) a nonuniform ES setting, where the phase difference is common across elements while the ES coefficients vary element-wise to increase design flexibility. For each regime, we formulate the corresponding FRI-based signal model and derive the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) for angle estimation. To recover the underlying FRI sampling structure, we develop a proximal-gradient algorithm implemented via alternating projections in matrix space and establish its convergence. Exploiting the recovered FRI structure, we construct an annihilating filter whose zeros encode user angles, enabling gridless estimation via polynomial root finding. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methods operate reliably across both configuration regimes and achieve improved angle estimation performance with low overhead."}

As a low-cost implementation for large-scale antenna arrays, reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) can be integrated into ISAC systems to realize the holographic ISAC paradigm, where enlarged radiation apertures achieve significant beamforming gains. In this paper, we investigate the tri-hybrid holographic ISAC framework, where the beamformer comprises digital, analog, and RHS-based electromagnetic (EM) layers. The analog layer employs a small number of phase shifters (PSs) to provide subarray-level phase control for the amplitude-modulated RHSs. Tri-hybrid beamforming provides a pathway for low-cost large-scale holographic ISAC. However, compared to conventional ISAC systems, it is challenging to achieve joint subarray-level phase control via PSs and element-level radiation amplitude control via RHSs for holographic ISAC. To address this, we present a tri-hybrid holographic ISAC scheme that minimizes sensing waveform error while satisfying the minimum user rate requirement. A joint optimization approach for PS phases and RHS amplitude responses is designed to address inter-layer coupling and distinct feasible regions. Theoretical analyses reveal that the optimized amplitude responses cluster near boundary values, i.e., 1-bit amplitude control, to reduce hardware and algorithmic complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a controllable performance trade-off between communication and sensing tasks. Measured RHS beam gain validates the enhancement of holographic beamforming through subarray-level phase shifting. Moreover, as the number of RHS elements increases, the proposed approach exceeds the performance of conventional hybrid beamforming while significantly reducing the number of PSs."}

In this work, we propose a precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder, augmented with an information-theoretic regularization. To achieve this, we introduce a differentiable mutual information lower-bound estimator as a training regularizer to promote effective utilization of the learned codebook under a fixed feedback budget. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves rates comparable to variable-length neural compression schemes, while operating with fixed-length feedback. Furthermore, the learned codewords exhibit significantly more uniform usage and capture interpretable structures that are strongly correlated with the underlying channel state information."}

Graphs, a prominent type of structure, can encode the relationships between any two entities (nodes). However, graphs neither allow connections that are not dyadic nor permit relationships between sets of nodes. We thus turn to simplicial complexes for connecting more than two nodes as well as modeling relationships between simplices, such as edges and triangles. Our data then consist of signals lying on topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes. Much recent work explores these topological signals, albeit primarily through deterministic formulations. We propose a probabilistic framework for random signals defined on simplicial complexes. Specifically, we generalize the classical notion of stationarity. By spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory, we define stationary topological signals as the outputs of topological filters given white noise. This definition naturally extends desirable properties of stationarity that hold for both time-series and graph signals. Crucially, we properly define topological power spectral density (PSD) through a clear spectral characterization. We then discuss the advantages of topological stationarity due to spectral properties via the PSD. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the practicality of these benefits through multiple synthetic and real-world simulations."}

In this study, we simulate this optically passive vision compression (OPVC) scheme and compare its rate-distortion performance to that of a standalone event camera (SAEC). We find that the rate-distortion performance of the OPVC scheme surpasses that of the SAEC and that this performance gap increases as the spatial resolution of the event camera increases."}

Existing solutions often rely on the point target assumption or treat multipath measurements as clutter, whereas current extended target trackers often lack the capability to maintain trajectory continuity in complex multipath environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the multipath extended target generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (MPET-GLMB) filter. A unified Bayesian framework based on labeled random finite set theory is derived to jointly model target existence, measurement partitioning, and the association between measurements, targets, and propagation paths. This formulation enables simultaneous trajectory estimation for both targets and reflectors without requiring heuristic post-processing. To enhance computational efficiency, a joint prediction and update implementation based on Gibbs sampling is developed. Furthermore, a measurement-driven adaptive birth model is introduced to initialize tracks without prior knowledge of target positions. Experimental results from simulated scenarios and real-world automotive radar data demonstrate that the proposed filter outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior state estimation accuracy and robust trajectory maintenance in dynamic multipath environments."}

Our main results show that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than that required by polynomial codes based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA. We identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. When the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large, we further show that this threshold is necessary in a generic sense.

Approach: The method aggregates data from hundreds of decoders, each trained on different speech features and EEG preprocessing setups to quantify neural tracking (NT) of speech signals. Using data from 39 participants (ages 18-24), we recorded 29 minutes of EEG per person while they listened to speech at six signal-to-noise ratios and a quiet story.

This problem has immediate relevance in standardized communication systems where the decoder acquires side information or priors about the true distribution that are unavailable to the fixed encoder. We formally define the mismatched quantization problem, demonstrating that the optimal reconstruction rule, termed generative decompression, aligns with classical Bayesian estimation by taking the conditional expectation under the true distribution given the quantization indices and adapting it to fixed-encoder constraints. This strategy effectively performs a generative Bayesian correction on the decoder side, strictly outperforming the conventional centroid rule. We extend this framework to transmission over noisy channels, deriving a robust soft-decoding rule that quantifies the inefficiency of standard modular source--channel separation architectures under mismatch. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to task-oriented decoding, showing that the optimal strategy shifts from conditional mean estimation to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. Experimental results on Gaussian sources and deep-learning-based semantic classification demonstrate that generative decompression closes a vast majority of the performance gap to the ideal joint-optimization benchmark, enabling adaptive, high-fidelity reconstruction without modifying the encoder."}

To address this, we propose variable rate vehicular federated learning (VR-VFL), a novel federated learning method designed specifically for vehicular networks under imperfect channel state information. VR-VFL combines dynamic client selection with adaptive transmission rate selection, while also allowing round times to flex in response to changing wireless conditions. At its core, VR-VFL is built on a bi-objective optimization framework that strikes a balance between improving learning convergence and minimizing the time required to complete each round. By accounting for both the challenges of mobility and realistic wireless constraints, VR-VFL offers a more practical and efficient approach to federated learning in vehicular edge networks.

While learning-based approaches can mitigate computational complexity and CSI overhead, the need for extensive site-specific (SS) datasets for model training remains a key challenge. To address these challenges, we develop a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled two-stage optimization framework that couples physics-based beam gain modeling with DRL for scalable online decision-making. In the first stage, a channel twin (CT) is constructed using a high-fidelity ray-tracing solver with geo-spatial contexts, and network information to capture SS propagation characteristics, and dual annealing algorithm is employed to precompute optimal transmission beam directions. In the second stage, a Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (MH-PPO) agent, equipped with a scalable multi-head actor-critic architecture, is trained on the DT-generated channel dataset to directly map complex channel and beam states to jointly execute UAV-BS-beam association decisions. The proposed PPO agent achieves a 44%-121% improvement over DQN and 249%-807% gain over traditional heuristic based optimization schemes in a dense UAV scenario, while reducing inference latency by several orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that DT-driven training pipelines can deliver high-performance, low-latency RRM policies tailored to SS deployments suitable for real-time resource management in next-generation aerial corridor networks."}

Virtual antenna array (VAA) techniques enable DoA estimation with a single antenna, making angle estimation feasible on such devices. However, BLE only provides a single-shot two-way channel frequency response (CFR) with a binary phase ambiguity issue, which hinders the direct application of VAA. To address this challenge, we propose a unified model that combines VAA with BLE two-way CFR, and introduce a neural network based phase recovery framework that employs row / column predictors with a voting mechanism to resolve the ambiguity. The recovered one-way CFR then enables super resolution algorithms such as MUSIC for joint time of arrival (ToA) and DoA estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under non-uniform VAAs, with mean square errors approaching the Cramer Rao bound at SNR $\\geq$ 5 dB."}

Firstly, we construct the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) performance analysis framework for CF XL-MIMO systems over centralized and distributed processing schemes. Notably, we derive the centralized minimum mean-square error (CMMSE) and local minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) combining schemes over arbitrary channel estimators. Then, focusing on the CMMSE and LMMSE combining schemes, we propose five low-complexity distributed combining schemes based on the matrix approximation methodology or the symmetric successive over relaxation (SSOR) algorithm. More specifically, we propose two matrix approximation methodology-aided combining schemes: Global Statistics \\& Local Instantaneous information-based MMSE (GSLI-MMSE) and Statistics matrix Inversion-based LMMSE (SI-LMMSE). These two schemes are derived by approximating the global instantaneous information in the CMMSE combining and the local instantaneous information in the LMMSE combining with the global and local statistics information by asymptotic analysis and matrix expectation approximation, respectively. Moreover, by applying the low-complexity SSOR algorithm to iteratively solve the matrix inversion in the LMMSE combining, we derive three distributed SSOR-based LMMSE combining schemes, distinguished from the applied information and initial values."}

The scenario with multi-antenna access points (APs) is considered over three different channel models: correlated Rician fading with fixed or random line-of-sight (LoS) phase-shifts, and correlated Rayleigh fading. With the aid of matrix inversion derivations, we can construct the conventional MMSE combining from the perspective of each AP, where global instantaneous information is involved. Then, for an arbitrary AP, we apply the statistics approximation methodology to approximate instantaneous terms related to other APs by channel statistics to construct the distributed combining scheme at each AP with local instantaneous information and global statistics. With the aid of uplink-downlink duality, we derive the respective GSLI-MMSE precoding schemes. Numerical results showcase that the proposed GSLI-MMSE scheme demonstrates performance comparable to the optimal centralized MMSE scheme, under the stable LoS conditions, e.g., with static users having Rician fading with a fixed LoS path."}

Specifically, in symbol interval $m$, the proposed fully-analog transmitter synthesizes an arbitrary complex excitation vector $\\bm x[m]\\in\\mathbb{C}^N$ with prescribed total power $\\|\\bm x[m]\\|_2^2=P$ from a single coherent RF tone, using only tunable phase-control elements embedded in a passive interferometric programmable network. The programmable network is excited through one input port while the remaining $N - 1$ input ports are impedance matched. In the ideal lossless case, the network transfer is unitary and therefore redistributes RF power among antenna ports without dissipative amplitude control.\n  The synthesis task is posed as a unitary state-preparation problem: program a unitary family so that $\\bm V(\\bm\\varphi)\\bm e_1=\\bm c$, where $\\bm c=\\bm x/\\sqrt{P}$ and $\\|\\bm c\\|_2=1$. We provide a constructive realization and a closed-form programming rule: a binary magnitude-splitting tree allocates the desired per-antenna magnitudes $|c_n|$ using $N -1$ tunable split ratios, and a per-antenna output phase bank assigns the target phases using $N$ tunable phase shifts. The resulting architecture uses $2N-1$ real tunable degrees of freedom and admits a deterministic $O(N)$ programming procedure with no iterative optimization, enabling symbol-by-symbol updates when the chosen phase-control technology supports the required tuning speed.\n  Using representative COTS components, we model the RF-front-end DC power of the proposed fully-analog transmitter and compare it against an equivalent COTS fully-digital array. For $N\\le 16$, the comparison indicates significant RF-front-end power savings for the fully-analog architecture.\n  The results in this paper are intended as a proof-of-concept for a narrowband fully-analog transmitter."}
