Conclusion: 该方法无需硬件改动即可显著提升iToF系统性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel compressed sensing method to improve the depth
reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation capability of indirect
Time-of-Flight (iToF) systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
hardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven
reconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and
constructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle
continuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise
range variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better
aligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse
recovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and
constrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which
effectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
traditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without
requiring any additional hardware changes.

Abstract: Cell-free wireless networks deploy distributed access points (APs) to
simultaneously serve user equipments (UEs) across the service region and are
regarded as one of the most promising network architectural paradigms. Despite
recent advances in the performance analysis and optimization of cellfree
wireless networks, it remains an open question whether large-scale deployment
of APs in existing wireless networks can cost-effectively achieve communication
capacity growth. Besides, the realization of a cell-free network is considered
to be a gradual long-term evolutionary process in which cell-free APs will be
incrementally introduced into existing cellular networks, and form a hybrid
communication network with the existing cellular base stations (BSs). Such a
collaboration will bridge the gap between the established cellular network and
the innovative cellfree network. Therefore, hybrid cellular and cell-free
networks (HCCNs) emerge as a practical and feasible solution for advancing
cell-free network development, and it is worthwhile to further explore its
performance limits. This paper presents a stochastic geometry-based hybrid
cellular and cell-free network model to analyze the distributions of signal and
interference and reveal their mutual coupling. Specifically, in order to
benefit the UEs from both the cellular BSs and the cell-free APs, a conjugate
beamforming design is employed, and the aggregated signal is analyzed using
moment matching. Then, the coverage probability of the hybrid network is
characterized by deriving the Laplace transforms and their higher-order
derivatives of interference components. Furthermore, the average achievable
rate of the hybrid network over channel fading is derived based on the
interference coupling analysis.

Abstract: The use of drones in a wide range of applications is steadily increasing.
However, this has also raised critical security concerns such as unauthorized
drone intrusions into restricted zones. Therefore, robust and accurate drone
detection and classification mechanisms are required despite significant
challenges due to small size of drones, low-altitude flight, and environmental
noise. In this letter, we propose a multi-modal approach combining radar and
acoustic sensing for detecting and classifying drones. We employ radar due to
its long-range capabilities, and robustness to different weather conditions. We
utilize raw acoustic signals without converting them to other domains such as
spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. This enables us to use
fewer number of parameters compared to the stateof-the-art approaches.
Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of the transformer encoder
architecture in fusing these sensors. Experimental results obtained in outdoor
settings verify the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to
the state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 所提算法有效解决了高移动性大规模MIMO-ODDM系统的信道估计问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing~(ODDM) modulation has recently
been regarded as a promising technology to provide reliable communications in
high-mobility situations. Accurate and low-complexity channel estimation is one
of the most critical challenges for massive multiple input multiple
output~(MIMO) ODDM systems, mainly due to the extremely large antenna arrays
and high-mobility environments. To overcome these challenges, this paper
addresses the issue of channel estimation in downlink massive MIMO-ODDM systems
and proposes a low-complexity algorithm based on memory approximate message
passing~(MAMP) to estimate the channel state information~(CSI). Specifically,
we first establish the effective channel model of the massive MIMO-ODDM
systems, where the magnitudes of the elements in the equivalent channel vector
follow a Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution. Further, as the number of antennas
grows, the elements in the equivalent coefficient matrix tend to become
completely random. Leveraging these characteristics, we utilize the MAMP method
to determine the gains, delays, and Doppler effects of the multi-path channel,
while the channel angles are estimated through the discrete Fourier transform
method. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed channel estimation
algorithm approaches the Bayesian optimal results when the number of antennas
tends to infinity and improves the channel estimation accuracy by about 30%
compared with the existing algorithms in terms of the normalized mean square
error.

similarity index improvement of 4%, thereby supporting downstream sensing and
communication applications.

Conclusion: 该框架有效降低了无人机编队的能耗，同时保证了控制稳定性和感知性能，为双功能低空无线网络提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal
technology for advancing low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), serving as a
critical enabler for next-generation communication systems. This paper
investigates the system design for energy-saving unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
formations in dual-functional LAWNs, where a ground base station (GBS)
simultaneously wirelessly controls multiple UAV formations and performs sensing
tasks. To enhance flight endurance, we exploit the aerodynamic upwash effects
and propose a distributed energy-saving formation framework based on the
adapt-then-combine (ATC) diffusion least mean square (LMS) algorithm.
Specifically, each UAV updates the local position estimate by invoking the LMS
algorithm, followed by refining it through cooperative information exchange
with neighbors. This enables an optimized aerodynamic structure that minimizes
the formation's overall energy consumption. To ensure control stability and
fairness, we formulate a maximum linear quadratic regulator (LQR) minimization
problem, which is subject to both the available power budget and the required
sensing beam pattern gain. To address this non-convex problem, we develop a
two-step approach by first deriving a closed-form expression of LQR as a
function of arbitrary beamformers. Subsequently, an efficient iterative
algorithm that integrates successive convex approximation (SCA) and
semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques is proposed to obtain a sub-optimal
dual-functional beamforming solution. Extensive simulation results confirm that
the 'V'-shaped formation is the most energy-efficient configuration and
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed design over benchmark schemes in
improving control performance.

Conclusion: CP-Mamba框架有效提升了近场稀疏XL-MIMO-OFDM系统的联合信道估计与定位性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates joint channel estimation and positioning in
near-field sparse extra-large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO)
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To achieve
cooperative gains between channel estimation and positioning, we propose a deep
learning-based two-stage framework comprising positioning and channel
estimation. In the positioning stage, the user's coordinates are predicted and
utilized in the channel estimation stage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of
channel estimation. Within this framework, we propose a U-shaped Mamba
architecture for channel estimation and positioning, termed as CP-Mamba. This
network integrates the strengths of the Mamba model with the structural
advantages of U-shaped convolutional networks, enabling effective capture of
local spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies of the channel.
Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage approach
with CP-Mamba architecture outperforms existing baseline methods. Moreover,
sparse arrays (SA) exhibit significantly superior performance in both channel
estimation and positioning accuracy compared to conventional compact arrays.

### [8] [Dependability Theory-based Statistical QoS Provisioning of Fluid Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19984)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于可靠性理论的框架，用于在有限块长度约束下为流体天线系统（FAS）提供统计服务质量（QoS）保障。通过推导新的闭合表达式和定义关键可靠性指标，研究进一步扩展了有效容量（EC）概念，并提出了任务有效能效（mEEE）指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究常忽略信道衰落的时变特性及其对关键任务操作的影响，因此需要一种新的框架来量化FAS的可靠性。

Method: 推导了N端口FAS在Nakagami-m衰落信道下的闭合表达式，定义了任务可靠性和首次故障平均时间（MTTFF）等指标，并扩展了有效容量概念。

Result: 通过仿真揭示了端口数量、QoS指数、信噪比和任务持续时间之间的关键权衡，为超可靠、低延迟和高效能的工业物联网（IIoT）系统设计提供了见解。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和指标为FAS在关键任务场景中的可靠性提供了量化工具，并展示了其在IIoT系统中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising technology
for next-generation wireless networks, offering real-time spatial
reconfiguration to enhance reliability, throughput, and energy efficiency.
Nevertheless, existing studies often overlook the temporal dynamics of channel
fading and their implications for mission-critical operations. In this paper,
we propose a dependability-theoretic framework for statistical
quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning of FAS under finite blocklength (FBL)
constraints. Specifically, we derive new closed-form expressions for the
level-crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) of an $N$-port FAS
over Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. Leveraging these second-order statistics, we
define two key dependability metrics such as mission reliability and mean
time-to-first-failure (MTTFF), to quantify the probability of uninterrupted
operation over a defined mission duration. We further extend the classical
effective capacity (EC) concept to incorporate mission reliability in the FBL
regime, yielding a mission EC (mEC). To capture energy efficiency under bursty
traffic and latency constraints, we also develop the mission effective energy
efficiency (mEEE) metric and formulate its maximization as a non-convex
fractional optimization problem. This problem is then solved via a modified
Dinkelbach's method with an embedded line search. Extensive simulations uncover
critical trade-offs among port count, QoS exponent, signal-to-noise ratio, and
mission duration, offering insights for the design of ultra-reliable,
low-latency, and energy-efficient industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) systems.

Conclusion: 提出的加权提升结构低秩矩阵补全方法在非均匀稀疏阵列方向估计中表现出高效性和优越性，样本复杂度接近最优。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for estimating the direction of arrival
(DOA) for a non-uniform and sparse linear sensor array using the weighted
lifted structure low-rank matrix completion. The proposed method uses a single
snapshot sample in which a single array of data is observed. The method is
rooted in a weighted lifted-structured low-rank matrix recovery framework. The
method involves four key steps: (i) lifting the antenna samples to form a
low-rank stature, then (ii) designing left and right weight matrices to reflect
the sample informativeness, (iii) estimating a noise-free uniform array output
through completion of the weighted lifted samples, and (iv) obtaining the DOAs
from the restored uniform linear array samples.
  We study the complexity of steps (i) to (iii) above, where we analyze the
required sample for the array interpolation of step (iii) for DOA estimation.
We demonstrate that the proposed choice of weight matrices achieves a
near-optimal sample complexity. This complexity aligns with the problem's
degree of freedom, equivalent to the number of DOAs adjusted for logarithmic
factors. Numerical evaluations show the proposed method's superiority against
the non-weighted counterpart and atomic norm minimization-based methods.
Notably, our proposed method significantly improves, with approximately a 10 dB
reduction in normalized mean-squared error over the non-weighted method at
low-noise conditions.

TL;DR: NeuroCLIP是一个结合EEG和fNIRS数据的深度学习框架，用于提升甲基苯丙胺依赖的客观评估和治疗效果监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲基苯丙胺依赖的评估和治疗监测常依赖主观报告，现有神经影像技术（如EEG和fNIRS）因单一局限性和手工特征提取而可靠性不足。

Method: 提出NeuroCLIP框架，通过渐进学习策略整合EEG和fNIRS数据，生成更可靠的生物标志物。

Conclusion: NeuroCLIP通过多模态数据提升了生物标志物的可靠性和鲁棒性，为成瘾研究和临床评估提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet
its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which
may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as
electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on
conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the
reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose
NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded
EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach
offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction.
Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves
discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and
healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone.
Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based
evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in
neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically,
we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by
showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores.
These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP
offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches,
providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially
improving clinical assessments.

Conclusion: InvCSINet通过INNs和信息补偿模块有效保留了CSI完整性，提升了反馈过程的性能与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising solution for efficient channel state
information (CSI) feedback in frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO
systems. Conventional deep learning-based methods typically rely on a deep
autoencoder to compress the CSI, which leads to irreversible information loss
and degrades reconstruction accuracy. This paper introduces InvCSINet, an
information-preserving CSI feedback framework based on invertible neural
networks (INNs). By leveraging the bijective nature of INNs, the model ensures
information-preserving compression and reconstruction with shared model
parameters. To address practical challenges such as quantization and
channel-induced errors, we endogenously integrate an adaptive quantization
module, a differentiable bit-channel distortion module and an information
compensation module into the INN architecture. This design enables the network
to learn and compensate the information loss during CSI compression,
quantization, and noisy transmission, thereby preserving the CSI integrity
throughout the feedback process. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed scheme, demonstrating superior CSI recovery performance and
robustness to practical impairments with a lightweight architecture.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了无人机（UAV）在ISM频段中因不对称上行链路干扰导致的通信问题，并通过实验测量和HARQ机制分析提出解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在ISM频段中面临上行链路干扰问题，尤其是高空环境下干扰更严重，影响通信质量。

Method: 通过测量实验（城市和农村地区）和HARQ机制（Type-I、Type-III等）分析干扰对吞吐量的影响。

Result: 实验显示高空干扰比地面高16.66 dB，不对称干扰导致上行链路ACK/NACK丢失，影响下行链路吞吐量。

Conclusion: 不对称上行链路干扰显著影响无人机通信性能，需优化HARQ机制以提升吞吐量。

Abstract: Command and control of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) is often realized
through air-to-ground (A2G) remote control (RC) links that operate in ISM
bands. While wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology is commonly used for UAV RC
links, ISM-based long-term evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G)
technologies have also been recently considered for the same purpose. A major
problem for UAV RC links in the ISM bands is that other types of interference
sources, such as legacy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmissions, may degrade the link
quality. Such interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV in the air
than the RC unit on the ground due to the UAV being in line-of-sight (LoS) with
a larger number of interference sources. To obtain empirical evidence of the
asymmetric interference conditions in downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), we first
conducted a measurement campaign using a helikite platform in urban and rural
areas at NC State University. The results from this measurement campaign show
that the aggregate interference can be up to 16.66 dB at higher altitudes up to
170 m, compared with the interference observed at a ground receiver. As a
result of this asymmetric UL interference, lost hybrid automatic repeat request
(HARQ) indicators (ACK/NACK) in the UL may degrade the DL throughput. To
investigate this, we study various HARQ mechanisms, including HARQ Type-I with
no combining, HARQ Type-I with chase combining, HARQ Type-III with incremental
redundancy, and burst transmission with chase combining. To evaluate the impact
of asymmetric UL interference on throughput performance, we consider three
steps of evaluation process: 1) standalone physical DL shared channel (PDSCH)
throughput evaluation with perfect ACK/NACK assumption; 2) standalone physical
UL control channel (PUCCH) decoding reliability evaluation; and 3) PDSCH DL
throughput evaluation with asymmetric UL ACK/NACK transmission.

Method: 采用多阶段混合CNN-Transformer框架，结合CNN提取的特征和基于注意力的架构，使用标量图进行分类。

Result: 模型在二元事件分类中得分为0.9039，多类事件分类中得分为0.8448，优于之前最佳模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源有限地区的儿科呼吸疾病诊断提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring
respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled
healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely
studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in
children aged <6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental
changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of
respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches
tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid
CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an
attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using
scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our
model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and
0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to
address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of
0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores
outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This
approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease
diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

secrecy energy efficiency, while ensuring reliable communication with
legitimate users. By exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom enabled by the
MA array, the system can form highly directional beams and deep nulls, thereby
significantly improving physical layer security. Numerical results demonstrate
that the proposed approach achieves superior secrecy energy efficiency,
attributed to the enhanced spatial flexibility provided by the movable antenna
architecture.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于FPGA加速的轻量级模型和知识蒸馏框架，解决了分布式光纤振动传感系统在动态条件下识别精度下降和实时数据处理的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式光纤振动传感系统在大规模监测和入侵事件识别中具有潜力，但动态条件下的识别精度下降和实时数据处理的计算瓶颈阻碍了其实际部署。

Method: 采用三层的深度可分离卷积网络（仅4141参数）和基于物理先验的跨域知识蒸馏框架，嵌入频域信息到时域模型中。

Result: 模型实现了每样本0.019毫秒的处理速度，支持168.68公里光纤的实时处理，识别精度在未知环境下从51.93%提升至95.72%。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了可解释信号处理与深度学习，为分布式光纤传感系统提供了实时处理和边缘计算的参考架构，并揭示了构建更高效、鲁棒和可解释AI系统的新方向。

Abstract: Distributed optical fiber vibration sensing (DVS) systems offer a promising
solution for large-scale monitoring and intrusion event recognition. However,
their practical deployment remains hindered by two major challenges:
degradation of recognition accuracy in dynamic conditions, and the
computational bottleneck of real-time processing for mass sensing data. This
paper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated
extreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation
framework. The proposed three-layer depthwise separable convolution network
contains only 4141 parameters, which is the most compact architecture in this
field to date, and achieves a maximum processing speed of 0.019 ms for each
sample covering a 12.5 m fiber length over 0.256 s. This performance
corresponds to real-time processing capabilities for sensing fibers extending
up to 168.68 km. To improve generalizability under changing environments, the
proposed cross-domain distillation framework guided by physical priors is used
here to embed frequency-domain insights into the time-domain model. This allows
for time-frequency representation learning without increasing complexity and
boosts recognition accuracy from 51.93% to 95.72% under unseen environmental
conditions. The proposed methodology provides key advancements including a
framework combining interpretable signal processing technique with deep
learning and a reference architecture for real-time processing and
edge-computing in DVS systems, and more general distributed optical fiber
sensing (DOFS) area. It mitigates the trade-off between sensing range and
real-time capability, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and
practical deployment requirements. Furthermore, this work reveals a new
direction for building more efficient, robust and explainable artificial
intelligence systems for DOFS technologies.

Abstract: Radio frequency interference (RFI) and malicious jammers are a significant
problem in our wireless world. Detecting RFI or jamming is typically performed
with model-based statistical detection or AI-empowered algorithms that use an
input baseband data or time-frequency representations like spectrograms. In
this work we depart from the previous approaches and we leverage data in
antenna array systems. We use Fourier imaging to localize spatially the sources
and then deploy a deep LSTM autoencoder that detects RFI and jamming as
anomalies. Our results for different power levels of the RFI/jamming sources,
and the signal of interest, reveal that our detector offers high performance
without needing any pre-existing knowledge regarding the RFI or jamming signal.

Abstract: Underwater target detection using active sonar constitutes a critical
research area in marine sciences and engineering. However, traditional signal
processing methods face significant challenges in complex underwater
environments due to noise, reverberation, and interference. To address these
issues, this paper presents a deep learning-based active sonar target detection
method that decomposes the detection process into separate angle and distance

predict target distance and angle, with the final target position determined by
integrating these estimates. Limited underwater acoustic data hinders effective
model training, but transfer learning and simulation offer practical solutions
to this challenge. Experimental results verify that the method achieves
effective and robust performance under challenging conditions.

Abstract: A subset of Human Activity Classification (HAC) systems are based on AI

the micro-Doppler attack targeting HAC from wireless orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. The attack is executed by inserting
artificial variations in a transmitted OFDM waveform to alter its micro-Doppler
signature when it reflects off a human target. We investigate two variants of
our scheme that manipulate the waveform at different time scales resulting in
altered receiver spectrograms. HAC accuracy with a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN) can be reduced to less than 10%.

Result: 实验表明，该方法比传统技术均方根误差降低20%，相关系数提高0.20。

Conclusion: 非线性方法能有效抑制呼吸谐波和噪声，实现稳健的心跳间隔估计。

Abstract: This study presents a nonlinear signal processing method for accurate
radar-based heartbeat interval estimation by exploiting the periodicity of
higher-order harmonics inherent in heartbeat signals. Unlike conventional
approaches that employ selective frequency filtering or track individual
harmonics, the proposed method enhances the global periodic structure of the
spectrum via nonlinear correlation processing. Specifically, smoothing and
second-derivative operations are first applied to the radar displacement signal
to suppress noise and accentuate higher-order heartbeat harmonics. Rather than
isolating specific frequency components, we compute localized autocorrelations
of the Fourier spectrum around the harmonic frequencies. The incoherent
summation of these autocorrelations yields a pseudo-spectrum in which the
fundamental heartbeat periodicity is distinctly emphasized. This nonlinear
approach mitigates the effects of respiratory harmonics and noise, enabling
robust interbeat interval estimation. Experiments with radar measurements from
five participants demonstrate that the proposed method reduces root-mean-square
error by 20% and improves the correlation coefficient by 0.20 relative to
conventional techniques.

Abstract: The integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) through spectrum
sharing have emerged as a promising solution to improve spectral efficiency and
meet increasing wireless demand. However, this coexistence introduces
significant challenges, including inter-system interference (ISI) and the low
Earth orbit satellite (LSat) movements. To capture the actual environment for
resource management, we propose a time-varying digital twin (DT)-aided
framework for ISTNs incorporating 3D map that enables joint optimization of
bandwidth (BW) allocation, traffic steering, and resource allocation, and aims
to minimize congestion. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear
programming (MINLP), addressed through a two-phase algorithm based on
successive convex approximation (SCA) and compressed sensing approaches.
Numerical results demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance in
queue length minimization compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: CP-AFDM是一种适用于6G的高性能波形，具有多功能应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel multicarrier waveform, termed chirp-permuted affine
frequency division multiplexing (CP-AFDM), which introduces a unique
chirp-permutation domain on top of the chirp subcarriers of the conventional
AFDM. Rigorous analysis of the signal model and waveform properties, supported
by numerical simulations, demonstrates that the proposed CP-AFDM preserves all
core characteristics of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) -
including robustness to doubly-dispersive channels, peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR), and full delay-Doppler representation - while further enhancing
ambiguity function resolution and peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) in the Doppler
domain. These improvements establish CP-AFDM as a highly attractive candidate
for emerging sixth generation (6G) use cases demanding both reliability and
sensing-awareness. Moreover, by exploiting the vast degree of freedom in the
chirp-permutation domain, two exemplary multifunctional applications are
introduced: an index modulation (IM) technique over the permutation domain
which achieves significant spectral efficiency gains, and a physical-layer
security scheme that ensures practically perfect security through
permutation-based keying, without requiring additional transmit energy or
signaling overhead.

Result: 方法显著降低BER、改善EVM，并提升雷达图像SINR。

Conclusion: 低复杂度干扰消除方法适用于实际应用，能有效提升多静态ISAC系统性能。

Abstract: Multistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, which use
distributed transmitters and receivers, offer enhanced spatial coverage and
sensing accuracy compared to stand-alone ISAC configurations. However, these
systems face challenges due to interference between co-existing ISAC nodes,
especially during simultaneous operation. In this paper, we analyze the impact
of this mutual interference arising from the co-existence in a multistatic ISAC
scenario, where a mono- and a bistatic ISAC system share the same spectral
resources. We first classify differenct types of interference in the power
domain. Then, we discuss how the interference can affect both sensing and
communications in terms of bit error rate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM),
and radar image under varied transmit power and RCS configurations through
simulations. Along with interfernce analysis, we propose a low-complexity
successive interference cancellation method that adaptively cancels either the
monostatic reflection or the bistatic line-of-sight signal based on a
monostatic radar image signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The
proposed framework is evaluated with both simulations and proof-of-concept
measurements using an ISAC testbed with a radar echo generator for object
emulation. The results have shown that the proposed method reduces BER and
improves EVM as well as radar image SINR across a wide range of SINR
conditions. These results demonstrate that accurate component-wise cancellation
can be achieved with low computational overhead, making the method suitable for
practical applications.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Polar码的线性解码方法，区别于Arikan的概率解码，适用于小损失或少量比特翻转的情况，并通过Mathematica实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polar码在通信领域具有重要意义，但传统解码方法复杂。本文旨在提出一种更直接的线性解码方法，简化解码过程。

Method: 采用线性方程直接解码，适用于小损失或少量比特翻转的情况；对于中等损失，采用重复传输策略。

Result: 通过数值示例展示了线性解码的可行性，并提供了Mathematica代码供实践验证。

Conclusion: 线性解码为Polar码提供了一种简单有效的替代方案，特别适用于特定场景，且易于实现。

Abstract: Polar encoding, described by Arikan in IEEE Transactions on Information
Theory, Vol. 55, No. 7, July 2009, was a milestone for telecommunications. A
Polar code distributes information among high and low-capacity channels,
showing the possibility of achieving perfect channel capacity. The
high-capacity channels allow almost noiseless transmission of data. When these
channels are not high noise, reliability is achieved in the signal
transmission. It starts to compete against codes such a Low-Density
Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. Polar code can be also considered error correcting,
based on the redundancy inherent in its structure. This feature makes polar
encoding also applicable to digital quantum-resistant cryptography protocols.
This work explores linear decoding at a first or single trial in the case of
small losses or small number of bit-flipping, and repeated transmission for
medium level losses. This is distinct from Arikans successive probabilistic
decoding by application of probabilistic rules. Linear decoding is done
directly from solving the linear equations connecting the codewords x and the
received signals y after transmission via noisy channels. Numerical examples
will be shown. Along with this work, programming in Mathematica language was
used. Codes are available for copy-and-paste for Mathematica users to
immediately try the described formalism.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种复合最大化方法，用于高效计算Marton误差指数及其逆函数，通过约束解耦技术显著降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marton误差指数是损失源编码中误差概率渐近衰减率的理论最优界，但其非凸优化问题形式导致计算方法不足，现有方法计算成本高昂。

Method: 采用复合最大化方法，通过约束解耦技术将问题分解为可高效求解的子问题，使用交替最大化算法和一维线搜索固定参数，使剩余子问题凸化。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在简单源和Ahlswede反例中显著优于现有方法，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 提出的算法通过约束解耦和交替最大化，实现了全局收敛，并显著降低了计算复杂度，为Marton误差指数的计算提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The error exponent in lossy source coding characterizes the asymptotic decay
rate of error probability with respect to blocklength. The Marton's error
exponent provides the theoretically optimal bound on this rate. However,
computation methods of the Marton's error exponent remain underdeveloped due to
its formulation as a non-convex optimization problem with limited efficient
solvers. While a recent grid search algorithm can compute its inverse function,
it incurs prohibitive computational costs from two-dimensional brute-force
parameter grid searches. This paper proposes a composite maximization approach
that effectively handles both Marton's error exponent and its inverse function.
Through a constraint decoupling technique, the resulting problem formulations
admit efficient solvers driven by an alternating maximization algorithm. By
fixing one parameter via a one-dimensional line search, the remaining
subproblem becomes convex and can be efficiently solved by alternating variable
updates, thereby significantly reducing search complexity. Therefore, the
global convergence of the algorithm can be guaranteed. Numerical experiments
for simple sources and the Ahlswede's counterexample, demonstrates the superior
efficiency of our algorithm in contrast to existing methods.

Abstract: The information bottleneck (IB) method is a technique designed to extract
meaningful information related to one random variable from another random
variable, and has found extensive applications in machine learning problems. In
this paper, neural network based estimation of the IB problem solution is
studied, through the lens of a novel formulation of the IB problem. Via
exploiting the inherent structure of the IB functional and leveraging the
mapping approach, the proposed formulation of the IB problem involves only a
single variable to be optimized, and subsequently is readily amenable to
data-driven estimators based on neural networks. A theoretical analysis is
conducted to guarantee that the neural estimator asymptotically solves the IB
problem, and the numerical experiments on both synthetic and MNIST datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the neural estimator.

Abstract: We consider the computation of the entanglement-assisted quantum
rate-distortion function, which plays a central role in quantum information
theory. We propose an efficient alternating minimization algorithm based on the
Lagrangian analysis. Instead of fixing the multiplier corresponding to the
distortion constraint, we update the multiplier in each iteration. Hence the
algorithm solves the original problem itself, rather than the Lagrangian
relaxation of it. Moreover, all the other variables are iterated in closed form
without solving multi-dimensional nonlinear equations or multivariate
optimization problems. Numerical experiments show the accuracy of our proposed
algorithm and its improved efficiency over existing methods.

Conclusion: 自适应WBP在相同复杂度下显著优于静态方法，适用于多种信道和编码场景。

Abstract: Weighted belief propagation (WBP) for the decoding of linear block codes is
considered. In WBP, the Tanner graph of the code is unrolled with respect to
the iterations of the belief propagation decoder. Then, weights are assigned to
the edges of the resulting recurrent network and optimized offline using a
training dataset. The main contribution of this paper is an adaptive WBP where
the weights of the decoder are determined for each received word. Two variants
of this decoder are investigated. In the parallel WBP decoders, the weights
take values in a discrete set. A number of WBP decoders are run in parallel to
search for the best sequence of weights in real time. In the two-stage decoder,
a small neural network is used to dynamically determine the weights of the WBP
decoder for each received word. The proposed adaptive decoders demonstrate
significant improvements over the static counterparts in two applications. In
the first application, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, polar and quasi-cyclic
low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes are used over an additive white
Gaussian noise channel. The results indicate that the adaptive WBP achieves bit
error rates (BERs) up to an order of magnitude less than the BERs of the static
WBP at about the same decoding complexity, depending on the code, its rate, and
the signal-to-noise ratio. The second application is a concatenated code
designed for a long-haul nonlinear optical fiber channel where the inner code
is a QC-LDPC code and the outer code is a spatially coupled LDPC code. In this
case, the inner code is decoded using an adaptive WBP, while the outer code is
decoded using the sliding window decoder and static belief propagation. The
results show that the adaptive WBP provides a coding gain of 0.8 dB compared to
the neural normalized min-sum decoder, with about the same computational
complexity and decoding latency.

Conclusion: 该方案为6G URLLC场景提供了一种容量逼近且低延迟的信道编码解决方案。

Abstract: With the evolution from 5G to 6G, ultra-reliable low-latency communication
(URLLC) faces increasingly stringent performance requirements. Lower latency
constraints demand shorter channel coding lengths, which can severely degrade
decoding performance. The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system
is considered a crucial technology to address this challenge due to its
abundant spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). While polar codes are theoretically
capacity-achieving in the limit of infinite code length, their practical
applicability is limited by significant decoding latency. In this paper, we
establish a unified theoretical framework and propose a novel spatiotemporal
two-dimensional (2-D) polar coding scheme for massive MIMO systems employing
minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. The polar transform is jointly
applied over both spatial and temporal dimensions to fully exploit the large
spatial DoF. By leveraging the near-deterministic
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) property of MMSE detection, the
spatial domain is modeled as a set of parallel Gaussian sub-channels. Within
this framework, we perform a theoretical analysis of the 2-D polarization
behavior using the Gaussian approximation method, and the capacity-achieving
property of the proposed scheme is proved under finite blocklength constraints
and large spatial DoF. Simulation results further demonstrate that, compared to
traditional time-domain polar codes, the proposed 2-D scheme can significantly
reduce latency while guaranteeing reliability, or alternatively improve
reliability under the same latency constraint -- offering a capacity-achieving
and latency-efficient channel coding solution for massive MIMO systems in
future 6G URLLC scenarios.

framework for rotatable RIS assisted physical-layer multicast systems, aiming
to maximize the sum of minimum multicast rates via joint optimization of base
station beamforming, RIS phase shifts, and orientation. Unlike unicast or
non-rotatable setups, the rotatable RIS adapts orientation to align signals
with user groups, improving fairness and rates for weak users. An alternating
optimization approach combines convex optimization for beamforming/phase shifts
with exhaustive search and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for orientation.
Majorization-Minimization-based algorithms solve subproblems iteratively.
Simulation results show the framework achieves 24.1% rate improvement via
exhaustive search and 20.0% via PSO over the non-rotatable RIS baseline, with
PSO performance close to the exhaustive search upper bound, highlighting the
benefits of physical-layer multicast and orientation optimization.

Abstract: The mismatch capacity characterizes the highest information rate of the
channel under a prescribed decoding metric and serves as a critical performance
indicator in numerous practical communication scenarios. Compared to the
commonly used Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), the Lower bound on the
Mismatch capacity (LM rate) generally provides a tighter lower bound on the
mismatch capacity. However, the efficient computation of the LM rate is
significantly more challenging than that of the GMI, particularly as the size
of the channel input alphabet increases. This growth in complexity renders
standard numerical methods (e.g., interior point methods) computationally
intensive and, in some cases, impractical. In this work, we reformulate the
computation of the LM rate as a special instance of the optimal transport (OT)
problem with an additional constraint. Building on this formulation, we develop
a novel numerical algorithm based on the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is well
known for its efficiency in solving entropy regularized optimization problems.
We further provide the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm,
revealing that the algorithm has a sub-linear convergence rate. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed
algorithm for the computation of the LM rate.

Abstract: Secret key agreement from correlated physical layer observations is a
cornerstone of information-theoretic security. This paper proposes and
rigorously analyzes a complete, constructive protocol for secret key agreement
from Gaussian sources using Sparse Regression Codes (SPARCs). Our protocol
systematically leverages the known optimality of SPARCs for both
rate-distortion and Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding, facilitated by their inherent nested
structure. The primary contribution of this work is a comprehensive end-to-end
analysis demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal secret
key rates with strong secrecy guarantees, as quantified by a vanishing
variational distance. We explicitly characterize the gap to the optimal rate,
revealing a fundamental trade-off between the key rate and the required public
communication overhead, which is governed by a tunable quantization parameter.
Furthermore, we uncover a non-trivial constrained optimization for this
parameter, showing that practical constraints on the SPARC code parameters
induce a peak in the achievable secret key rate. This work establishes SPARCs
as a viable and theoretically sound framework for secure key generation,
providing a compelling low-complexity alternative to existing schemes and
offering new insights into the practical design of such protocols.

Conclusion: 提出的信道模型能够有效描述大规模卫星星座中的信号传播特性，为通信系统设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: A general satellite channel model is proposed for communications between a
rapidly moving low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite in a mega-constellation and a
stationary user on Earth. The channel uses a non-homogeneous binomial point
process (NBPP) for modelling the satellite positions, marked with an
ascending/descending binary random variable for modelling the satellite
directions. Using the marked NBPP, we derive the probability distributions of
power gain, propagation delay, and Doppler shift, resulting in a stochastic
signal propagation model for the mega-constellation geometry in isolation of
other effects. This forms the basis for our proposed channel model as a
randomly time-varying channel. The scattering function of this channel is
derived to characterise how the received power is spread in the delay-Doppler
domain. Global channel parameters such as path loss and channel spread are
analysed in terms of the scattering function. The channel statistics and the
global channel parameters closely match realistic orbit simulations of the
Starlink constellation.

Abstract: A combinatorial analysis of the false alarm (FA) and misdetection (MD)
probabilities of non-adaptive group testing with sparse pooling graphs is
developed. The analysis targets the combinatorial orthogonal matching pursuit
and definite defective detection algorithms in the noiseless, non-quantitative
setting. The approach follows an ensemble average perspective, where average
FA/MD probabilities are computed for pooling graph ensembles with prescribed
degree distributions. The accuracy of the analysis is demonstrated through
numerical examples, showing that the proposed technique can be used to
characterize the performance of non-adaptive group testing schemes based on
sparse pooling graphs.

Abstract: Inter-user interference remains a critical bottleneck in wireless
communication systems, particularly in the emerging paradigm of semantic
communication (SemCom). Compared to traditional systems, inter-user
interference in SemCom severely degrades key semantic information, often
causing worse performance than Gaussian noise under the same power level. To
address this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal
Model Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality
rooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to
distinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the
need for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA. Our key innovation
lies in shuffle-based orthogonalization, where randomly permuting the positions
of JSCC feature vectors transforms inter-user interference into Gaussian-like
noise. By assigning each user a unique shuffling pattern, the interference is
treated as channel noise, enabling effective mitigation using diffusion models
(DMs). This approach not only simplifies system design by requiring a single
universal JSCC model but also enhances privacy, as shuffling patterns act as
implicit private keys. Additionally, we extend the framework to scenarios
involving semantically correlated data. By grouping users based on semantic
similarity, a cooperative beamforming strategy is introduced to exploit
redundancy in correlated data, further improving system performance. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
multi-user SemCom frameworks, achieving superior semantic fidelity, robustness
to interference, and scalability-all without requiring additional training
overhead.

Abstract: Wireless communication can be simply subjected to malicious attacks due to
its open nature and shared medium. Detecting jamming attacks is the first and
necessary step to adopt the anti-jamming strategies. This paper presents novel
cooperative jamming detection methods that use the low-rank structure of the
received signal matrix. We employed the likelihood ratio test to propose
detectors for various scenarios. We regarded several scenarios with different
numbers of friendly and jamming nodes and different levels of available
statistical information on noise. We also provided an analytical examination of
the false alarm performance of one of the proposed detectors, which can be used
to adjust the detection threshold. We discussed the synthetic signal generation
and the Monte Carlo (MC)-based threshold setting method, where knowledge of the
distribution of the jamming-free signal, as well as several parameters such as
noise variance and channel state information (CSI), is required to accurately
generate synthetic signals for threshold estimation. Extensive simulations
reveal that the proposed detectors outperform several existing methods,
offering robust and accurate jamming detection in a collaborative network of
sensing nodes.

Conclusion: GTRS码为非GRS的MDS码提供了新的研究方向，丰富了MDS码的理论和应用。

Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are considered optimal because the
minimum distance cannot be improved for a given length and code size. The most
prominent MDS codes are likely the generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes. In
1989, Roth and Lempel constructed a type of MDS code that is not a GRS code
(referred to as non-GRS). In 2017, Beelen et al. introduced twisted
Reed-Solomon (TRS) codes and demonstrated that many MDS TRS codes are indeed
non-GRS. Following this, the definition of TRS codes was generalized to the
most comprehensive form, which we refer to as generalized twisted Reed-Solomon
(GTRS) codes. In this paper, we prove that two families of GTRS codes are
non-GRS and provide a systematic generator matrix for a class of GTRS codes.
Inspired by the form of the systematic generator matrix for GTRS codes,we also
present a construction of non-GRS MDS codes.

characterized invertible reverse-ordering transforms on the space of

deformations of the ordinary Legendre transform. In this note, we prove that
all those generalized Legendre transforms on functions correspond to the
ordinary Legendre transform on dually corresponding affine-deformed functions.
That is, generalized convex conjugates are convex conjugates of affine-deformed
functions. We conclude this note by sketching how this result can be
interpreted from the lens of information geometry.

Abstract: The coverage depth problem in DNA data storage is about minimizing the
expected number of reads until all data is recovered. When they exist, MDS
codes offer the best performance in this context. This paper focuses on the
scenario where the base field is not large enough to allow the existence of MDS
codes. We investigate the performance for the coverage depth problem of codes
defined over a small finite field, providing closed formulas for the expected
number of reads for various code families. We also compare the results with the
theoretical bounds in asymptotic regimes. The techniques we apply range from
probability, to duality theory and combinatorics.

Abstract: DNA data storage systems encode digital data into DNA strands, enabling dense
and durable storage. Efficient data retrieval depends on coverage depth, a key
performance metric. We study the random access coverage depth problem and focus
on minimizing the expected number of reads needed to recover information
strands encoded via a linear code. We compute the asymptotic performance of a
recently proposed code construction, establishing and refining a conjecture in
the field by giving two independent proofs. We also analyze a geometric code
construction based on balanced quasi-arcs and optimize its parameters. Finally,
we investigate the full distribution of the random variables that arise in the
coverage depth problem, of which the traditionally studied expectation is just
the first moment. This allows us to distinguish between code constructions
that, at first glance, may appear to behave identically.

Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user
mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the
user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff
(HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the
allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for
mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with
continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve
as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that
integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the
associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the
first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on
the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA)
observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF).
Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is
more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy
automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the
overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a
response time less than 0.4 ms.
