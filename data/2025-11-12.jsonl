Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a robust waveform for high-mobility and doubly dispersive channels, outperforming OFDM under strong Doppler. However, the most studied multicarrier OTFS (MC-OTFS) is not easily predictable because the input-output (I$/$O) relation is not given by (twisted) convolution. Recently, the Zak-transform based OTFS (Zak-OTFS or OTFS 2$.$0) was proposed, which provides a single domain delay Doppler (DD) processing framework with predictable I$/$O behavior. This paper presents one of the first over-the-air (OTA) demonstrations of Zak-OTFS at mmWave frequencies. We design a complete Zak-OTFS based mmWave OTA system featuring root-raised-cosine (RRC) filtering for enhanced DD-domain predictability, higher-order modulations up to 16-QAM, and a low-overhead preamble for synchronization. A comprehensive signal model incorporating carrier frequency offset (CFO) and timing impairments is developed, showing these effects can be jointly captured within the effective DD-domain channel. Experimental validation on the COSMOS testbed confirms the feasibility and robustness of Zak-OTFS under realistic mmWave conditions, highlighting its potential for efficient implementations in beyond-5G and 6G systems."}

Despite the wide adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, many AI-based time series analytical models suffer from task-specificity (i.e. one model for one task) and structural rigidity (i.e. the input-output format is fixed), leading to limited model performances and resource wastes. In this paper, we propose a Causal-Guided Multimodal Large Language Model (CM-LLM) that can solve heterogeneous power system time-series analysis tasks. First, we introduce a physics-statistics combined causal discovery mechanism to capture the causal relationship, which is represented by graph, among power system variables. Second, we propose a multimodal data preprocessing framework that can encode and fuse text, graph and time series to enhance the model performance. Last, we formulate a generic \"mask-and-reconstruct\" paradigm and design a dynamic input-output padding mechanism to enable CM-LLM adaptive to heterogeneous time-series analysis tasks with varying sample lengths. Simulation results based on open-source LLM Qwen and real-world dataset demonstrate that, after simple fine-tuning, the proposed CM-LLM can achieve satisfying accuracy and efficiency on three heterogeneous time-series analytics tasks: missing data imputation, forecasting and super resolution."}

Also, the significant data collection needed for training makes real-world deployment difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an ML-based, decoder-only solution for compressed CSI. Our approach uses a standardized encoder for CSI compression on the user side and a site-specific generative decoder at the base station to refine the compressed CSI using environmental knowledge. We introduce two training schemes for the generative decoder: An end-to-end method and a two-stage method, both utilizing a goal-oriented loss function. Furthermore, we reduce the data collection overhead by using a site-specific digital twin to generate synthetic CSI data for training. Our simulations highlight the effectiveness of this solution across various feedback overhead regimes."}

Traditionally, turbo product decoding passes log likelihood ratios (LLRs) between the component decoders, inherently losing information when bit correlation exists. Such correlation can arise exogenously from sources like intersymbol interference and endogenously during component code decoding. To preserve these correlations and improve performance, we propose turbo product decoding based on group probabilities. We theoretically predict mutual information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of group over bit-probability decoding. To translate these theoretical insights to practice, we revisit non-binary TPCs that naturally support group-probability decoding. We show that any component list decoder that takes group probabilities as input and outputs block-wise soft-output can partially preserve bit correlation, which we demonstrate with symbol-level ORBGRAND combined with soft-output GRAND (SOGRAND). Our results demonstrate that group-probability-based turbo product decoding achieves SNR gains of up to 0.3 dB for endogenous correlation and 0.7 dB for exogenous correlation, compared to bit-probability decoding."}

True-time-delay (TTD) circuits can realign the frequency dependence but require large delay ranges and intricate calibration, limiting scalability. Another line of work explores one- and two-dimensional array geometries, including linear, circular, and concentric circular, that exhibit distinct broadband behaviors such as different beam-squint sensitivities and focusing characteristics. These observations motivate adapting the array layout to enable wideband-friendly focusing and enhance multi-user performance without TTD networks. We propose a movable antenna (MA) aided architecture based on hierarchical sub-connected hybrid beamforming (HSC-HBF) in which antennas are grouped into tiles and only the tile centers are repositioned, providing slow geometric degrees of freedom that emulate TTD-like broadband focusing while keeping hardware and optimization complexity low. We show that the steering vector is inherently frequency dependent and that reconfiguring tile locations improves broadband focusing. Simulations across wideband near-field scenarios demonstrate robust squint suppression and consistent gains over fixed-layout arrays, achieving up to 5\\% higher sum rate, with the maximum improvement exceeding 140\\%."}

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end coding (E2EC) framework to tackle it. The semantic coding problem is formed by extending the information bottleneck (IB) theory over noisy channels, which is a tradeoff between bit-level communication rate and semantic distortion. With a structural decomposition of encoding to handle code length and content respectively, we can construct an end-to-end trainable encoder that supports the direct compression of a data source into a finite codebook. To optimize our E2EC across non-differentiable operations, e.g., sampling, we use the powerful policy gradient to support gradient-based updates. Experimental results illustrate that E2EC achieves high inference quality with low bit rates, outperforming representative baselines compatible with digital SemCom systems."}

While such arrays offer practical advantages in terms of cost and size, existing localization methods suffer from a fundamental limitation: their performance degrades significantly as the source moves into the far-field, a common challenge known as the thresholding effect. To address this issue, we reformulate the localization problem in the modified polar representation (MPR) coordinate system, which parameterizes the source location using its azimuth, elevation, and inverse-range. We have developed a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) estimator, which is subsequently transformed into a tight semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via semidefinite relaxation, enhanced with additional constraints to improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both angle and inverse-range estimation in near-field scenarios. More importantly, it maintains this optimal performance in the far-field, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, which exhibit significant error at large ranges. The proposed solution thus provides a reliable, unified localization system that is effective irrespective of the source range."}

In multi-channel multi-tag AmBC, one of major challenges from the aspect of symbol detection is the image channel crosstalk, which is induced by the inevitable in-phase/quadrature (IQ) imbalance. To address this issue, in this paper, we study symbol detection in multi-channel multi-tag AmBC under IQ imbalance. Considering the differential encoding scheme at the BTs, we propose a novel symbol detection model that incorporates IQ imbalance parameters, the presence or absence of both the incident signal and the backscattered signal of the image channel. On this basis, considering an energy difference detector at the AmBC receiver, we derive the closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as well as the near-optimal detection threshold to minimize BER. However, calculating the near-optimal detection threshold requires prior information, such as the IQ imbalance parameters, the presence probability of the incident signal of the image channel and the backscattered signal of the image channel, the signal power of the ambient RF source, and the noise power, which are typically unknown to the AmBC receiver in practice. To eliminate the need for the prior information, we propose a threshold estimation method using the received samples. Numerical results indicate that under IQ imbalance, directly using the existing method leads to a significant degradation in BER performance. However, this degradation can be effectively mitigated by our derived detection threshold."}

Model performance rapidly degrades when user attention fluctuates, brain states shift over time, or irregular artifacts appear during interaction. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a user state-aware electroencephalogram (EEG) filtering framework that refines neural representations before decoding user intentions. The proposed method continuously estimates the user's cognitive state (e.g., focus or distraction) from EEG features and filters unreliable segments by applying adaptive weighting based on the estimated attention level. This filtering stage suppresses noisy or out-of-focus epochs, thereby reducing distributional drift and improving the consistency of subsequent decoding. Experiments on multiple EEG datasets that emulate real BCI scenarios demonstrate that the proposed state-aware filtering enhances classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared with conventional preprocessing pipelines. These findings highlight that leveraging brain-derived state information--even without additional user labels--can substantially improve the reliability of practical EEG-based BCIs."}

In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments."}

Compared with existing work that mostly considered either far-field or near-field covert communications, we consider in this paper a more general and practical mixed-field scenario, where multiple Bobs are located in either the near-field or far-field of Alice, in the presence of multiple near-field Willies. Specifically, we first consider a two-Bob-one-Willie system and show that conventional fixed-position XL-arrays suffer degraded sum-rate performance due to the energy-spread effect in mixed-field systems, which, however, can be greatly improved by subarray movement. On the other hand, for transmission covertness, it is revealed that sufficient angle difference between far-field Bob and Willie as well as adequate range difference between near-field Bob and Willie are necessary for ensuring covertness in fixed-position XL-array systems, while this requirement can be relaxed in movable XL-array systems thanks to flexible channel correlation control between Bobs and Willie. Next, for general system setups, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable sum-rate under covertness constraint. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization given positions of subarrays and an outer problem for subarray movement optimization. Although these two subproblems are still non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by using the successive convex approximation technique and devising a customized differential evolution algorithm, respectively. Last, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed movable XL-array in balancing sum-rate and covert communication requirements."}

Subsequently, we derive analytical lower bounds on the conditional coverage probabilities under Nakagami-$m$ and Rayleigh fading, respectively. These expressions have a low computational complexity, enabling efficient numerical evaluations. We validate the effectiveness of our theoretical model by contrasting the coverage probability obtained from our analysis with that estimated from a Starlink constellation. The results show that our analysis provides a tight lower bound on the actual value and, surprisingly, matches the empirical simulations almost perfectly with a 1 dB shift.

The proposed approach explicitly accounts for the mutual coupling (MC) effect, modeled via scattering parameter multiport network theory. In Stage~I, a dimension-reduced subspace-based method is proposed to estimate the common angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the received signals across all users. In Stage~II, MC-aware cascaded channel estimation is performed for a typical user. The equivalent measurement vectors for each cascaded path are extracted and the reference column is reconstructed using a compressed sensing (CS)-based approach. By leveraging the structure of the cascaded channel, the reference column is rearranged to estimate the AoA at the RIS, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with estimating other columns. Additionally, the common angle of departure (AoD) at the RIS is also obtained in this stage, which significantly reduces the pilot overhead for estimating the cascaded channels of other users in Stage~III. The RIS phase shift training matrix is designed to optimize performance in the presence of MC and outperforms random phase scheme.

While machine learning (ML) autoencoders show promise for CSI reconstruction and reducing feedback overhead, they introduce new challenges with standardization, interoperability, and backward compatibility. Also, the significant data collection needed for training makes real-world deployment difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an ML-based, decoder-only solution for compressed CSI. Our approach uses a standardized encoder for CSI compression on the user side and a site-specific generative decoder at the base station to refine the compressed CSI using environmental knowledge. We introduce two training schemes for the generative decoder: An end-to-end method and a two-stage method, both utilizing a goal-oriented loss function. Furthermore, we reduce the data collection overhead by using a site-specific digital twin to generate synthetic CSI data for training. Our simulations highlight the effectiveness of this solution across various feedback overhead regimes."}

Existing radio access network (RAN) slicing schemes typically optimise isolated layers or objectives, lacking physical-layer realism, slot-level adaptability, and interpretable per-slice performance metrics. This paper presents a joint optimisation framework that integrates Dynamic Hybrid Resource Utilisation with MCS-Based Intelligent Layering, formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly allocates bandwidth, power, and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) indices per slice. The model incorporates finite blocklength effects, channel misreporting, and correlated fading to ensure realistic operation. Two modes are implemented: a Baseline Mode that ensures resource-efficient QoS feasibility, and an Ideal-Chaser Mode that minimises deviation from ideal per-slice rates. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves energy efficiencies above $10^7$~kb/J in Baseline Mode and sub-millisecond latency with near-ideal throughput in Ideal-Chaser Mode, outperforming recent optimisation and learning-based methods in delay, fairness, and reliability. The framework provides a unified, interpretable, and computationally tractable solution for dynamic cross-layer resource management in 5G and beyond networks."}

The objective is to minimize transmit power while meeting users signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly reduces transmit power compared with baseline methods, highlighting the efficiency of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted SWIPT systems."}

In this paper, we consider a monostatic sensing scenario in which OFDM is used for the downlink and its reflected echo signal is used for sensing. OFDM and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) are the options for uplink transmission. When OFDM is used in the uplink, the power difference between this signal and the echo signal leads to a power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) scenario. In contrast, adopting DFT-s-OFDM as uplink signal enables a waveform-domain NOMA(WD-NOMA). Affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) have been proven to be DFT-s-OFDM based waveforms. This work focuses on such a WD-NOMA system, where AFDM or OTFS is used as uplink waveform and OFDM is employed for downlink transmission and sensing. We show that the OFDM signal exhibits additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)-like behavior in the affine domain, allowing it to be modeled as white noise in uplink symbol detection. To enable accurate data detection performance, an AFDM frame design and a noise power estimation (NPE) method are developed. Furthermore, a two-dimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-OMP) algorithm is applied for sensing by iteratively identifying delay-Doppler components of each target. Simulation results demonstrate that the WD-NOMA ISAC system, employing either AFDM or OTFS, outperforms the PD-NOMA ISAC system that uses only the OFDM waveform in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance. Furthermore, the proposed NPE method yields additional improvements in BER."}

In OTFS, the data symbols are mapped to the Doppler-Delay (DD) domain. In this paper, we address bandwidth-efficient estimation of channel state information (CSI) for MIMO OTFS systems. Existing channel estimation techniques either require non-overlapped DD-domain pilots and associated guard regions across multiple antennas, sacrificing significant communication rate as the number of transmit antennas increases, or sophisticated algorithms to handle overlapped pilots, escalating the cost and complexity of receivers. We introduce a novel pilot-aided channel estimation method that enjoys low overhead while achieving high performance. Our approach embeds pilots within each OTFS burst in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. We propose a novel use of TF and DD guard bins, aiming to preserve waveform orthogonality on the pilot bins and DD data integrity, respectively. The receiver first obtains low-complexity coarse estimates of the channel parameters. Leveraging the orthogonality, a virtual array (VA) is constructed. This enables the formulation of a sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem, in which the coarse estimates are used to build a low-dimensional dictionary matrix. The SSR solution yields high-resolution estimates of channel parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves good performance with only a small number of pilots and guard bins. Furthermore, the required overhead is independent of the number of transmit antennas, ensuring good scalability of the proposed method for large MIMO arrays. The proposed approach considers practical rectangular transmit pulse-shaping and receiver matched filtering, and also accounts for fractional Doppler effects."}

Using random matrix theory, we show that, in the asymptotic regime, the dominant singular values and vectors of the transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels converge to their deterministic Line-of-Sight (LoS) components, almost irrespective of the Ricean factors. This enables RIS phase configuration using only LoS information through a closed-form Sign Alignment (SA) rule that maximizes the channel gain. Furthermore, when the RIS is asymptotically larger than the transceiver arrays, proper RIS configuration can render the end-to-end MIMO channel in the capacity formula asymptotically diagonal, thereby eliminating inter-stream interference and enabling Over-The-Air (OTA) spatial multiplexing without channel knowledge at the transmitter. Building on this result, a waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm that allocates RIS elements to spatial streams, based on the asymptotic singular values and statistical channel parameters, is proposed. Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that the proposed schemes achieve performance comparable to conventional Riemannian manifold optimization, but with orders of magnitude lower runtime."}

However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments."}
