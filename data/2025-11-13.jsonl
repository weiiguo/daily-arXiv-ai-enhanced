In this paper, we propose a novel dual-hop wireless network, where the first hop consists of a hybrid free-space optics (FSO) / terahertz (THz) link, and the second hop incorporates an aerial RIS-based radio frequency (RF) link. To provide a comprehensive performance evaluation, a comparative analysis of two switching strategies is conducted: (1) hard switching and (2) soft switching. Novel closed-form expressions are derived for key performance metrics, including outage probability and bit error rate. These expressions are then utilized to investigate the impact of various system parameters. Our proposed hybrid model demonstrates a 52.54% performance improvement over the traditional RF-FSO framework. Moreover, the integration of an aerial RIS in the second hop enhances system performance by 41.39%. Numerical findings suggest that strategically placing the aerial RIS at a lower altitude and maintaining an equal, shorter distance from both communication endpoints significantly improves overall system performance. To analyze the response under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, asymptotic analysis is performed, and the diversity order of the system is determined. Finally, the analytical results are validated through a Monte Carlo simulation."}

Over larger-yet still constant-sized-fields, algebraic-geometry codes are known to beat the GV bound. In this work, we leverage this phenomenon by taking traces of AG codes. Our hope is that the margin by which AG codes exceed the GV bound will withstand the parameter loss incurred by taking the trace from a constant field extension to the binary field. In contrast to concatenation, the usual alphabet-reduction method, our analysis of trace-of-AG (TAG) codes uses the AG codes' algebraic structure throughout - including in the alphabet-reduction step.\n  Our main technical contribution is a Hasse-Weil-type theorem that is well-suited for the analysis of TAG codes. The classical theorem (and its Grothendieck trace-formula extension) are inadequate in this setting. Although we do not obtain improved constructions, we show that a constant-factor strengthening of our bound would suffice. We also analyze the limitations of TAG codes under our bound and prove that, in the high-distance regime, they are inferior to code concatenation. Our Hasse-Weil-type theorem holds in far greater generality than is needed for analyzing TAG codes. In particular, we derive new estimates for exponential sums."}

The MCTS decoder searches for test error patterns (TEPs) in the received information bits and obtains codeword candidates through re-encoding. The TEP search is executed on a tree structure, guided by a neural network policy trained via MCTS-based learning. The trained policy guides the decoder to find the correct TEPs with minimal steps from the root node (all-zero TEP). The decoder outputs the codeword with maximum likelihood when the early stopping criterion is satisfied.

The study is motivated by a moving object tracking problem in a sensor network and can find applications in settings where the order of the symbols in a codeword cannot be maintained or observed. In this paper a multiset coding scheme is proposed on source data that can be organized as a flat or cyclic multi-dimensional integer lattice (grid). A fundamental idea in the solution approach is to decompose the original source data grid into sub-grids. The original multiset coding problem can then be restricted to each of the sub-grid. Solutions for the sub-grids are subsequently piece together to form the desired solution. We name this circle of idea as sunmao construction in reference to woodwork construction method with ancient origin. Braid codes are specific solutions defined using the sunmao construction. They are easy to define for multi-dimensional grids. Moreover for a code of a given code set size and multiset cardinality, if we measure coding efficiency by the number of distinct symbols required, then braid codes have asymptotic order equal to those that are optimal. We also show that braid codes have interesting inherent error correction properties."}

Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training."}

They have been enabled through surfaces with reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM) properties, known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and through flexible antennas, which can be viewed as realizations of SREs in the EM domain and space domain, respectively. However, these technologies rely on electronically reconfigurable or movable components, introducing implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new domain to enable SREs, the frequency domain, through the concept of movable signals, where the signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. We first analyze movable signals in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, showing that they can achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission (EGT). We then study movable signals under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, showing that they remain effective by leveraging reflections from surfaces made of uniformly spaced elements with fixed EM properties, denoted as fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs). Analytical results reveal that a FIS-aided system using movable signals can achieve up to four times the received power of a RIS-aided system using fixed-frequency signals."}

The value of the rate in dependence of the distortion level as well as the optimizer used in the codebook construction are of theoretical and practical importance in communication and information theory.

Both computer vision and radar modules are included in the simulator. In computer vision module, the real-time model for object detection with global nearest neighbor is first used to detect and track human targets in the video.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions.

A key challenge is to ensure ultra-reliable and low-latency transmission of haptic packets under channel variations and potential network outages. To address these issues, one approach relies on local estimation of haptic feedback at the operator side. However, designing an accurate estimator that can faithfully reproduce the true haptic forces remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, xHAP, based on cross-modal attention to estimate haptic feedback. xHAP fuses information from two distinct data streams: the teleoperator's historical force feedback and the operator's control action sequence. We employ modality-specific encoders to learn temporal representations, followed by a cross-attention layer where the teleoperator haptic data attend to the operator input. This fusion allows the model to selectively focus on the most relevant operator sensory data when predicting the teleoperator's haptic feedback. The proposed architecture reduces the mean-squared error by more than two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods and lowers the SNR requirement for reliable transmission by $10~\\mathrm{dB}$ at an error threshold of $0.1$ in a 3GPP UMa scenario.

To address this issue, we propose Mip-NeWRF, a physics-informed neural framework for accurate indoor channel prediction based on sparse channel measurements. The framework operates in a ray-based pipeline with coarse-to-fine importance sampling: frustum samples are encoded, processed by a shared multilayer perceptron (MLP), and the outputs are synthesized into the channel frequency response (CFR). Prior to MLP input, Mip-NeWRF performs conical-frustum sampling and applies a scale-consistent hybrid positional encoding to each frustum. The scale-consistent normalization aligns positional encodings across scene scales, while the hybrid encoding supplies both scale-robust, low-frequency stability to accelerate convergence and fine spatial detail to improve accuracy. During training, a curriculum learning schedule is applied to stabilize and accelerate convergence of the shared MLP. During channel synthesis, the MLP outputs, including predicted virtual transmitter presence probabilities and amplitudes, are combined with modeled pathloss and surface interaction attenuation to enhance physical fidelity and further improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach: in typical scenarios, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) is reduced by 14.3 dB versus state-of-the-art baselines."}

Conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming fails to meet these quality demands due to high sidelobes, a wide main lobe and the resulting low contrast, whereas advanced adaptive methods are typically precluded by the computational cost and the single-snapshot constraint of real-time field operation. To overcome this trade-off, we propose and detail the implementation of higher-order non-linear beamforming methods using the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum technique, coupled with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for ultrasonic in-air microphone arrays. Our efficient implementation allows for enabling GPU-accelerated, real-time performance on embedded computing platforms. Through validation against the DAS baseline using simulated and real-world acoustic data, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvements in image contrast, establishing higher-order non-linear beamforming as a practical, high-performance solution for in-air acoustic imaging."}

However, existing studies mainly focus on line-shaped PASS architectures, whose limited spatial flexibility constrains their applicability in multiuser and indoor scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional (2D) pinching-antenna system (2D-PASS) that extends the conventional line-shaped structure into a continuous dielectric waveguide plane, thereby forming a reconfigurable radiating plane capable of dynamic beam adaptation across a 2D spatial domain. An optimization framework is developed to maximize the minimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among user equipments (UEs) by adaptively adjusting the spatial configuration of pinching antennas (PAs), serving as an analog beamforming mechanism for dynamic spatial control. For the continuous-position scenario, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently explore the nonconvex search space, while a discrete variant is introduced to accommodate practical hardware constraints with limited PA placement resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 2D-PASS substantially improves the minimum SNR compared with conventional line-shaped PASS and fixed-position antenna (FPA) benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under varying user distributions and distances."}

In this work, we propose a novel method to produce CC locations in true spatial coordinates with the aid of a digital twin (DT). Our main contribution is a new framework that (i) extracts large-scale channel-state information (CSI) features from estimated CSI and the DT and (ii) matches these features with a cosine-similarity loss function. The DT-aided loss function is then combined with a conventional CC loss to learn a positioning function that provides true spatial coordinates without relying on labeled data. Our results for a simulated indoor scenario demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the relative mean distance error by 29% compared to the state of the art. We also show that the proposed approach is robust to DT modeling mismatches and a distribution shift in the testing data."}

By modeling transceiver distortions as residual amplitude and phase noise, we introduce the approximate phase-and-amplitude distortion detector (PAD-D), which operates in the polar domain and effectively mitigates both distortion components through distortion-aware weighting. The proposed detector performs reliable detection under generalized HW impairment conditions, achieving substantial performance gains over the conventional Euclidean detector (EUC-D) and the Gaussian-assumption phase noise detector (GAP-D), which is primarily designed to address phase distortions. In addition, we derive a closed-form high-SNR symbol error probability (SEP) approximation, which offers a generic analytical expression applicable to arbitrary constellations. Simulation results demonstrate that the PAD-D achieves up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in the error floor relative to EUC-D and GAP-D for both high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and super amplitude phase-shift keying (SAPSK) constellations, establishing a unified and practical framework for detection under realistic transceiver impairments. Building on this framework, we further develop optimized constellations tailored to PAD-D, where the symbol positions are optimized in the complex plane to minimize SEP. The optimality of these constellations is confirmed through extensive simulations, which also verify the accuracy of the proposed analytical SEP approximation, even for the optimized designs."}

However, previous studies often focused only on front-end acoustic components or back-end electronic components, overlooking end-to-end coupling among the transducer, cable, and receiver. This work develops a complete analytical model for system-level sensitivity optimization based on the Krimholtz, Leedom, and Matthaei (KLM) model. The KLM model is rederived from first principles of linear piezoelectric constitutive equations, 1D wave equations and transmission line theory to clarify its physical basis and applicable conditions. By encapsulating the acoustic components into a controlled voltage source and extending the model to include lumped-parameter representations of cable and receiver, an end-to-end equivalent circuit is established. Analytical expressions for the system transfer functions are derived, revealing the coupling effects among key parameters such as transducer element area (EA), cable length (CL), and receiver impedance (RI). Experimental results validate the model with an average error below 5%. Additionally, a low-frequency tailing phenomenon arising from exceeding the 1D vibration assumption is identified and analyzed, illustrating the importance of understanding the model's applicable conditions and providing a potential pathway for artifact suppression. This work offers a comprehensive framework for optimizing detection sensitivity and improving image fidelity in PAI systems."}

However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal morphology of DAS signals presents analytical challenges where conventional methods prove suboptimal, while being well-suited for deep learning approaches. Although our previous work, DAS Masked Autoencoder (DAS-MAE), established state-of-the-art performance and generalization without labels, it is not satisfactory in frequency analysis in temporal-dominated DAS data. Moreover, the limitation of effective training data fails to address the substantial data requirements inherent to Transformer architectures in DAS-MAE. To overcome these limitations, we present an enhanced framework incorporating short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for explicit temporal-frequency feature extraction and pioneering video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training to mitigate data constraints. This approach learns high-level representations (e.g., event classification) through label-free reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate transformative improvements: 0.1% error rate in few-shot classification (90.9% relative improvement over DAS-MAE) and 4.7% recognition error in external damage prevention applications (75.4% improvement over from-scratch training). As the first work to pioneer video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training, available training resources are expanded by bridging computer vision and distributed sensing areas. The enhanced performance and generalization facilitate DAS deployment across diverse industrial scenarios while advancing cross-modal representation learning for industrial IoT sensing."}

The baseline MMC approach consists of two stages processing vectors of Voltage and Current Signal (VCS) of constant size and producing bitstreams of constant rate but varying quality. In the proposed approach, the parametric model and the rate allocated to the first stage, as well as the residual compression method of the second stage and its associated rate, are jointly optimized to achieve a target distortion of the reconstructed signal. Three approaches are proposed. An exhaustive search serves as a baseline for comparison. Then, an approach involving a Golden Section search is exploited to determine the rate of the first stage with reduced complexity. Finally, rate-distortion models of the compression efficiency for each model in the first stage are employed to obtain a subset of promising models in the first stage and reduced-size search intervals for the rate selection in both stages. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reduced-complexity MMC approach reduces the rate for a given distortion constraint compared to state-of-the-art solutions for VCS with equivalent complexity."}

Both single-user and multi-user cases are considered. 1) For single-user case, the LLM-based pinching beamforming codebook generation problem is formulated to maximize the beamforming gain. Then, the optimal transmit beamforming is obtained by maximum ratio transmission (MRT). 2) For multi-user case, a joint codebook generation and beam selection problem is formulated based on the system sum rate under the minimum mean square error (MMSE) transmit beamforming. The training labels for pinching beamforming are constructed by selecting the beam combination that maximizes system performance from each user's Top-S candidate beams.

They have been enabled through surfaces with reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM) properties, known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and through flexible antennas, which can be viewed as realizations of SREs in the EM domain and space domain, respectively. However, these technologies rely on electronically reconfigurable or movable components, introducing implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new domain to enable SREs, the frequency domain, through the concept of movable signals, where the signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. We first analyze movable signals in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, showing that they can achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission (EGT). We then study movable signals under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, showing that they remain effective by leveraging reflections from surfaces made of uniformly spaced elements with fixed EM properties, denoted as fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs). Analytical results reveal that a FIS-aided system using movable signals can achieve up to four times the received power of a RIS-aided system using fixed-frequency signals."}
