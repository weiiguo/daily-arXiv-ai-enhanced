We describe the methodology for mapping the\niterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose\ndifferent methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is\nproposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball\nwith a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for\nreinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to\nimprove the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list\ndecoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values\nthat substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism\ngroup of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose\na feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing\nhigh-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after\nthe existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of\nthe reinforcement learning block.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation\nframework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the\nestimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the\npilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position\nlabel-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the\nabsolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during\nthe localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nPCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%."}

This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users."}

Expanding upon the\ntheoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this\npaper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying\nthe deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative\nto the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)\nmodel is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite\nchannels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established\nthrough discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness\nof the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and urban canyon tests.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation\nframework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the\nestimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the\npilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position\nlabel-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the\nabsolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during\nthe localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nPCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%."}

This paper investigates the convert\ntransmission design in MEC-based networked ISAC systems towards LAE, where an\nMEC server coordinates multiple access points to simultaneously receive\ncomputation tasks from multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), locate a\ntarget in a sensing area, and maintain UAVs' covert transmission against\nmultiple wardens. We first derive closed-form expressions for the detection\nerror probability (DEP) at wardens. Then, we formulate a total energy\nconsumption minimization problem by optimizing communication, sensing, and\ncomputation resources as well as UAV trajectories, subject to the requirements\non quality of MEC services, DEP, and radar signal-to-interference-and-noise\nratio, and the causality of UAV trajectories. An alternating optimization based\nalgorithm is proposed to handle the considered problem, which decomposes it\ninto two subproblems: joint optimization of communication, sensing, and\ncomputation resources, and UAV trajectory optimization. The former is addressed\nby a successive convex approximation based algorithm, while the latter is\nsolved via a trust-region based algorithm. Simulations validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with various benchmarks, and\nreveal the trade-offs among communication, sensing, and computation in LAE\nsystems."}
