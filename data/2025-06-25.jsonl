To systematically compare these\nparadigms, we establish a dual-scale mobility framework where a UAV-mounted\nuniform linear array (ULA) serves as a base station transmitting confidential\ninformation to a legitimate user (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper\n(Eve).

Motivated by this, this\npaper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token\nsimilarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage\nchannels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is\ncombinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length.

Data transmission is handled via\nthe Wi-Fi 6 radio that is embedded in the nodes' SoC, decoupling\nsynchronization from payload transport. A prototype system with a limited\namount of network nodes was used to verify the proposed distributed microphone\narray's wireless data acquisition and synchronization capabilities. This\narchitecture lays the groundwork for scalable, deployable ultrasound arrays for\nsound source localization applications in bio-acoustic research and industrial\nacoustic monitoring."}

In\nthe weak turbulence regime, the probability density function describing the\ndistribution of the channel fading coefficient that models these four effects\nis known in the literature. This function is an integral equation, which makes\nit difficult to find simple analytical expressions of important performance\nmetrics such as the bit error rate (BER) and symbol error rate (SER). In this\npaper, we present simple and accurate approximations of the average BER and SER\nfor pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) in the weak turbulence regime for an\nintensity modulation and direct detection system. Our numerical results show\nthat the proposed expressions exhibit excellent accuracy when compared against\nMonte Carlo simulations. To demonstrate the usefulness of the developed\napproximations, we perform two asymptotic analyses. First, we investigate the\nadditional transmit power required to maintain the same SER when the spectral\nefficiency increases by 1 bit/symbol. Second, we study the asymptotic behavior\nof our SER approximation for dense PAM constellations and high transmit power."}

Such\nrates can be achieved by increasing the system bandwidth or the modulation\nformat, which in turn requires maintaining or increasing the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR). Such SNR requirements can be achieved by increasing the\ntransmitted optical power. This increase in optical power causes the emergence\nof relative intensity noise (RIN), a signal-dependent impairment inherent to\nthe transmitter laser, which ultimately limits the performance of the system.\nIn this paper, we develop an analytical symbol error rate (SER) expression for\nthe optimal detector for the IM-DD optical link under study. The developed\nexpression takes into account the signal-dependent nature of RIN and does not\nmake any assumptions on the geometry or probability distribution of the\nconstellation. Our expression is therefore applicable to general\nprobabilistically and/or geometrically shaped systems. Unlike results available\nin the literature, our proposed expression provides a perfect match to\nnumerical simulations of probabilistic and geometrically shaped systems."}

A Physical Layer Security Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper investigates the potential of movable antenna (MA)-enabled\nmicro-mobility to replace UAV-enabled macro-mobility for enhancing physical\nlayer security (PLS) in air-to-ground communications. While UAV trajectory\noptimization offers high flexibility and Line-of-Sight (LoS) advantages, it\nsuffers from significant energy consumption, latency, and complex trajectory\noptimization. Conversely, MA technology provides fine-grained spatial\nreconfiguration (antenna positioning within a confined area) with ultra-low\nenergy overhead and millisecond-scale response, enabling real-time channel\nmanipulation and covert beam steering. To systematically compare these\nparadigms, we establish a dual-scale mobility framework where a UAV-mounted\nuniform linear array (ULA) serves as a base station transmitting confidential\ninformation to a legitimate user (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper\n(Eve). We formulate non-convex average secrecy rate (ASR) maximization problems\nfor both schemes: 1) MA-based micro-mobility: Jointly optimizing antenna\npositions and beamforming (BF) vectors under positioning constraints; 2)\nUAV-based macro-mobility: Jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and BF\nvectors under kinematic constraints. Extensive simulations reveal distinct\noperational regimes: MA micro-mobility demonstrates significant ASR advantages\nin low-transmit-power scenarios or under antenna constraints due to its\nenergy-efficient spatial control. Conversely, UAV macro-mobility excels under\nresource-sufficient conditions (higher power, larger antenna arrays) by\nleveraging global mobility for optimal positioning. The findings highlight the\ncomplementary strengths of both approaches, suggesting hybrid micro-macro\nmobility as a promising direction for balancing security, energy efficiency,\nand deployment complexity in future wireless networks."}

To ensure the link reliability of high-mobility satellite\ncommunication scenarios, the emerging orthogonal delay-Doppler division\nmultiplexing (ODDM) modulation has attracted significant research attention. In\nthis paper, we study the diversity gain achieved by ODDM modulation along with\nthe mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. Additionally, we propose\nan orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm based detector to\nharvest the diversity gain promised by ODDM modulation. By operating the linear\nand non-linear estimator iteratively, the orthogonal approximate message\npassing (OAMP) detector can utilize the sparsity of the effective delay-Doppler\n(DD) domain channel and extract the full diversity. Simulation results reveal\nthe relationship between diversity gain and system parameters, and demonstrate\nthat our proposed detector can achieve better performance than the conventional\nmessage passing methods with significantly reduced complexity."}
