Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation enables simple\nand robust channel compensation under such conditions. However, fractional\ndelay and Doppler components introduce inter-path interference, degrading\nestimation accuracy. We propose a two-stage estimation method based on Prony's\ntechnique using OTFS pilot signals with M subchannels and N pilot repetitions.\nIn the first stage, Doppler frequencies are estimated by jointly solving M\ncoupled Prony equations, exploiting the periodicity of the pilot signal. In the\nsecond stage, delays are estimated by applying the discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) and Prony's method to each Doppler component obtained in the first stage.\nThe proposed method can accurately estimate up to N-1 delay-Doppler parameters\nunder noiseless conditions. In noisy environments, conventional information\ncriteria such as AIC and BIC yield suboptimal performance; thus, a heuristic\nmodel order selection is adopted.

Suppose there are $h\\geq1$ failed nodes\nin a rack (called the host rack). Then together with its surviving nodes, the\nhost rack downloads recovery data from $\\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its\nfailed nodes. In this paper, we focus on studying the rack-aware minimum\nstorage generating (MSR) codes for repairing $h$ failed nodes within the same\nrack. By using the coupled-layer construction with the alignment technique, we\nconstruct the first class of rack-aware MSR codes for all\n$\\bar{k}+1\\leq\\bar{d}\\leq\\bar{n}-1$ which achieve the small sub-packetization\n$l=\\bar{s}^{\\lceil\\bar{n}/\\bar{s}\\rceil}$ where the field size $q$ increases\nlinearly with $n$ and $\\bar{s}=\\bar{d}-\\bar{k}+1$. In addition, these codes\nachieve optimal repair bandwidth for $1\\leq h\\leq u-v$, and asymptotically\noptimal repair bandwidth for $u-v+1\\leq h\\leq u$. In particular, they achieve\noptimal access when $h=u-v$. It is worth noting that the existing rack-aware\nMSR codes which achieve the same sub-packetization\n$l=\\bar{s}^{\\lceil\\bar{n}/\\bar{s}\\rceil}$ are only known for the special case\nof $\\bar{d}=\\bar{n}-1$, $h=1$, and the field size is much larger than ours.\nThen, based on our first construction we further develop another class of\nexplicit rack-aware MSR codes with even smaller sub-packetization\n$l=\\bar{s}^{\\lceil\\bar{n}/(\\bar{s}+1)\\rceil}$ for all admissible values of\n$\\bar{d}$."}
