We describe the methodology for mapping the\niterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose\ndifferent methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is\nproposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball\nwith a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for\nreinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to\nimprove the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list\ndecoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values\nthat substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism\ngroup of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose\na feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing\nhigh-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after\nthe existing decoders.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation\nframework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the\nestimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the\npilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position\nlabel-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the\nabsolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during\nthe localization NN training.

This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs.

Due\nto the limitations of physically moving radiating elements, electronically\nreconfigurable antennas are emerging as practical implementations of FASs,\nsince changing the radiation pattern is functionally equivalent to physically\nmoving the device. However, electronically reconfigurable antennas pose a\nchallenge in terms of analytical modeling, often requiring full-wave\nsimulations or measurements for their characterization; this severely limits\nthe extraction of theoretical insights useful for system design. Motivated by\nthese difficulties and the growing interest in FASs, we propose in this paper a\ncomplete analytical model for metasurface-based embodiments of FASs.\nSpecifically, we advocate for the implementation of the FAS concept through\ndynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), hitherto proposed as array replacements in\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We leverage circuit theory to\nrewrite the conventional signal model of FASs in terms of admittance matrices\naccounting for the electromagnetic effects inherent to metasurfaces. The model\nis validated with full-wave simulations, showing good agreement. We further\nillustrate how to apply the model for standard performance analysis, and\nprovide closed-form expressions for key metrics, including the resulting signal\ncovariance matrix.

A base station (BS) furnishes\ndownlink communication to multiple users while concurrently interrogating a\nsensing target. We jointly optimize the BS transmit beamformer and the\nreflection/transmission coefficients of every active STAR-RIS in order to\nmaximize the aggregate communication sum-rate, subject to (i) a stringent\nsensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, (ii) an\nupper bound on the leakage of confidential information, and (iii) individual\nhardware and total power constraints at both the BS and the STAR-RISs. The\nresulting highly non-convex program is tackled with an efficient alternating\noptimization (AO) framework.

Geometric observations highlight\nthe unique characteristics of DPE errors stemming from multipath and thermal\nnoise as estimation bias and variance respectively. Expanding upon the\ntheoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this\npaper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying\nthe deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative\nto the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)\nmodel is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite\nchannels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established\nthrough discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness\nof the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT\nbias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite\nchannels. Additionally, the PVT bias increases with satellite elevation angles,\ninfluenced by the CAF multipath bias projection.

The key idea lies\nin strategically controlling the signal envelope to mitigate memory-induced\nimpairments, such as nonlinearity, overshoot, peak-to-average power ratio\nenhancement, etc. The proposed scheme incorporates a dynamic selective mapping\n(DSLM) mechanism at the transmitter, enabling an untypical bit-to-symbol\nmapping in which the current symbol is not only determined by the current bits\npattern but also by previously generated symbols within a specified memory\nlength. At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR\nalgorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by\nDSLM. Experimental verification in a 56GBaud PAM8 system demonstrates that the\nproposed scheme exhibits 1dB receiver sensitivity improvement over 2km\nsingle-mode fiber transmission.

Spoofers are identified and rejected after signal acquisition using\na novel approach that tests the consistency of acquired signals by comparing\ntheir respective direction of arrival (DoA) and pseudorange estimates in a test\nthat is invariant with respect to the unknown receiver position.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model\n(ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous\nmulti-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that\nadapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is\ntrained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It\njointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user\nprecoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A\nkey innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),\nenabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel\nconditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive\nretraining. Furthermore, we employ the Dynamic Weight Averaging (DWA) algorithm\nto dynamically balance the individual task losses during multi-task training,\nensuring efficient and stable learning across diverse objectives. Extensive\nsimulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance\ncompared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization\ncapabilities to unseen system configurations.
