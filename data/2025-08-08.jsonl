A common approach to get\ninformation molecules in MC involves harvesting them from the environment;\nhowever, the harvested molecules are often a mixture of various environmental\nmolecules, and the initial concentration ratios in the reservoirs are\nidentical, which hampers high-fidelity transmission techniques such as\nmolecular shift keying (MoSK). This paper presents a transmitter design that\nharvests molecules from the surrounding environment and stores them in two\nreservoirs. To separate the mixed molecules, energy is consumed to transfer\nthem between reservoirs. Given limited energy resources, this work explores\nenergy-efficient strategies to optimize transmitter performance. Through\ntheoretical analysis and simulations, we investigate different methods for\nmoving molecules between reservoirs. The results demonstrate that transferring\nhigher initial concentration molecules enhances transmitter performance, while\nusing fewer molecules per transfer further improves efficiency. These findings\nprovide valuable insights for optimizing MC systems through energy-efficient\nmolecule transfer techniques."}

The removal of the\nbattery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables unprecedented level\nof miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, low fabrication\nand maintenance cost. The uW power wall for WiFi transmitters is broken for the\nfirst time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its\nfrequency through second-order intermodulation of a twotone incident wave. The\ntwo-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing\nsensitivity down to Pmin -19 dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using\nthe harvested voltage as a proxy for the Received Signal Strength (RSS),\nallowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s)\nshared across tags in indoor neighborhoods."}

However, the radio environment is unpredictable\nand often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods\nis often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the\nreceiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing\ndistributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect\nthe presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)\nare deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,\nRIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem\nis modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping\nof received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating\nthe optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting\nreceived signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may\npotentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable\neffective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss\nfunction that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio\n(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed\ndistributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and\nbetter overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.\nFurthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance\neven under jamming attack."}

We first derive the upper bound on energy efficiency\nfor a single-user downlink communication system, where the user is equipped\nwith a single MA. Then, the energy efficiency maximization problem is\nformulated to optimize the MA position, and an efficient algorithm based on\nsuccessive convex approximation is proposed to solve this non-convex\noptimization problem.
