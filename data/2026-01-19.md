*Sanghyun Kim,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出ZSRM方法，结合GNSS阴影和反射匹配，提高城市定位精度，相比ZSM改进10-53%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统阴影匹配基于离散网格，精度受网格分辨率限制，难以满足保护等级要求；ZSM使用集合估计但仍受限于GNSS阴影，无法充分缩小位置集

Method: 提出ZSRM（zonotope shadow and reflection matching），结合GNSS阴影和反射信息，利用LOS/NLOS卫星信号判断接收机位置，通过集合估计而非网格化方法

Result: 城市环境实地测试显示：ZSRM相比ZSM，RMS水平位置误差改进10.0%-53.6%，横街和沿街位置边界分别改进18.0%-50.1%和30.7%-59.3%

Conclusion: ZSRM通过结合阴影和反射匹配，显著提高了城市GNSS定位精度，能够更好地满足保护等级要求，实现更精确的接收机位置估计

Abstract: In urban areas, signal reception conditions are often poor due to reflections from buildings, resulting in inaccurate global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based positioning. Various 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) GNSS techniques, including shadow matching, have been proposed to address this issue. However, conventional shadow matching estimates positions in a discretized manner. The accuracy of this approach is limited by the resolution of the grid points representing the candidate receiver positions, making it difficult to achieve robust urban positioning and to ensure that the position estimate satisfies user-specified protection levels or safety bounds. To overcome these limitations, zonotope shadow matching (ZSM) has been proposed, which utilizes a set-based position estimate rather than grid-based estimates. ZSM calculates the GNSS shadow--an area on the ground where the line-of-sight (LOS) is blocked and only non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals can be received--to estimate the receiver's position set. ZSM distinguishes between LOS and NLOS satellites, determining that the receiver is inside the GNSS shadow if the satellite is NLOS and outside if the satellite is LOS. However, relying solely on GNSS shadows limits the ability to sufficiently reduce the size of the receiver position set and to precisely estimate the receiver's location. To address this, we propose zonotope shadow and reflection matching (ZSRM) to enhance positioning accuracy in urban areas. The proposed ZSRM technique is validated through field tests using GNSS signals collected in an urban environment. Consequently, the RMS horizontal position error of ZSRM improved by 10.0% to 53.6% compared with ZSM, while the RMS cross-street and along-street position bounds improved by 18.0% to 50.1% and 30.7% to 59.3%, respectively.

*Jakob Struye,Nabeel Nisar Bhat,Siddhartha Kumar,Mohammad Hossein Moghaddam,Jeroen Famaey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 毫米波ISAC系统中，仅用25%的感知时间就能实现接近全时感知的手势识别准确率，验证了毫米波ISAC在无线XR等应用中的潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ISAC系统需要在感知和通信之间分配时隙，但这种分配对感知性能的具体影响尚不明确，需要深入研究

Method: 使用两个毫米波设备进行恒定波束扫描，收集测试对象执行不同手势时的波束对功率数据，构建数据集，然后训练卷积神经网络手势分类器，并通过子采样模拟减少感知时间的效果

Result: 实验表明，仅使用25%的感知时间，分类准确率仅比全时感知下降0.15个百分点，证明在低感知时间下仍能保持高质量的感知性能

Conclusion: 毫米波ISAC系统能够在低感知时间下实现高质量感知，同时提供极高的数据吞吐量，是真正无线扩展现实等应用的关键使能技术

Abstract: Most Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) systems require dividing airtime across their two modes. However, the specific impact of this decision on sensing performance remains unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we therefore investigate the impact on a gesture recognition system using a Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) ISAC system. With our dataset of power per beam pair gathered with two mmWave devices performing constant beam sweeps while test subjects performed distinct gestures, we train a gesture classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks. We then subsample these measurements, emulating reduced sensing airtime, showing that a sensing airtime of 25 % only reduces classification accuracy by 0.15 percentage points from full-time sensing. Alongside this high-quality sensing at low airtime, mmWave systems are known to provide extremely high data throughputs, making mmWave ISAC a prime enabler for applications such as truly wireless Extended Reality.

Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) remains a significant global health concern affecting approximately 1\% of births worldwide. Phonocardiography has emerged as a supplementary tool to diagnose CHD cost-effectively. However, the performance of these diagnostic models highly depends on the quality of the phonocardiography, thus, noise reduction is particularly critical. Supervised UNet effectively improves noise reduction capabilities, but limited clean data hinders its application. The complex time-frequency characteristics of phonocardiography further complicate finding the balance between effectively removing noise and preserving pathological features. In this study, we proposed a self-supervised phonocardiography noise reduction model based on Noise2Noise to enable training without clean data. Augmentation and contrastive learning are applied to enhance its performance. We obtained an average SNR of 12.98 dB after filtering under 10~dB of hospital noise. Classification sensitivity after filtering was improved from 27\% to 88\%, indicating its promising pathological feature retention capabilities in practical noisy environments.

### [4] [Differentiating through binarized topology changes: Second-order subpixel-smoothed projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10737)
*Giuseppe Romano,Rodrigo Arrieta,Steven G. Johnson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出SSP2方法，通过Hessian正则化解决拓扑优化中拓扑变化时的不可微问题，保证二阶可微性同时维持二值结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拓扑优化中可制造的二值结构与梯度优化存在根本矛盾，现有SSP方法在拓扑变化（如界面合并）时无法保证可微性，违反梯度优化算法的收敛保证

Method: 在SSP方法基础上，通过滤波场的Hessian进行正则化，得到二阶可微的投影密度（SSP2），在拓扑变化时保持二阶可微性，同时保证几乎处处二值结构

Result: SSP2在连接主导（频繁拓扑变化）情况下比SSP收敛更快，其他情况下性能相当；支持更广泛的优化算法（如内点法），可无缝集成到现有代码中

Conclusion: SSP2解决了拓扑优化中拓扑变化时的可微性问题，提升了收敛保证和算法适用性，是现有方法的有效替代方案

Abstract: A key challenge in topology optimization (TopOpt) is that manufacturable structures, being inherently binary, are non-differentiable, creating a fundamental tension with gradient-based optimization. The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods. Since SSP2 adds minimal complexity relative to SSP or traditional projection schemes, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: UBiGTLoc：一种基于双向LSTM和图Transformer的无线传感器网络定位框架，可在有无锚节点情况下实现高精度定位，仅需低成本RSSI数据。

Abstract: Sensor nodes localization in wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks is crucial for the effective operation of diverse applications, such as smart cities and smart agriculture. Existing sensor nodes localization approaches heavily rely on anchor nodes within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Anchor nodes are sensor nodes equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers and thus, have known locations. These anchor nodes operate as references to localize other sensor nodes. However, the presence of anchor nodes may not always be feasible in real-world IoT scenarios. Additionally, localization accuracy can be compromised by fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose UBiGTLoc, a Unified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Graph Transformer Localization framework. The proposed UBiGTLoc framework effectively localizes sensor nodes in both anchor-free and anchor-presence WSNs. The framework leverages BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and employs Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that UBiGTLoc consistently outperforms existing methods and provides robust localization across both dense and sparse WSNs while relying solely on cost-effective RSSI data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度作为全球第二大洋葱生产国，年产量超过2600万吨，但在储存过程中约有30-40%的洋葱因腐烂、发芽和失重而损失。传统存储方法要么成本低但效果差（传统存储有40%腐败率），要么效果好但价格昂贵（冷藏存储），不适合占印度大多数的小农户。

Abstract: India is the second largest producer of onions in the world, contributing over 26 million tonnes annually. However, during storage, approximately 30-40% of onions are lost due to rotting, sprouting, and weight loss. Despite being a major producer, conventional storage methods are either low-cost but ineffective (traditional storage with 40% spoilage) or highly effective but prohibitively expensive for small farmers (cold storage). This paper presents a low-cost IoT-based smart onion storage system that monitors and automatically regulates environmental parameters including temperature, humidity, and spoilage gases using ESP32 microcontroller, DHT22 sensor, MQ-135 gas sensor, and UV-C disinfection technology. The proposed system aims to reduce onion spoilage to 15-20% from the current 40-45% wastage rate while remaining affordable for small and marginal farmers who constitute the majority in India. The system is designed to be cost-effective (estimated 60k-70k INR), energy-efficient, farmer-friendly, and solar-powered.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了多种数据驱动的交通传感器布设策略，发现强调空间均匀覆盖和主动学习的策略能显著降低预测误差，仅用10个传感器就能在柏林和曼哈顿分别减少60%和70%的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市街道交通流量数据对城市规划至关重要，但现有传感器布设通常基于行政优先级而非数据优化，导致覆盖偏差和估计性能下降。需要评估数据驱动的传感器布设策略来改善这一问题。

Method: 使用柏林（Strava自行车计数）和曼哈顿（出租车计数）的街道段数据，比较基于网络中心性、空间覆盖、特征覆盖和主动学习的空间布设策略，并研究临时传感器的时间部署方案。

Result: 强调空间均匀覆盖和采用主动学习的策略预测误差最低。仅10个传感器就能在柏林和曼哈顿分别减少60%和70%的MAE。时间部署上，将测量均匀分布在周中能进一步减少7%（柏林）和21%（曼哈顿）的误差。

Conclusion: 城市可通过采用数据驱动的传感器布设策略显著提高数据效用，同时在临时和永久部署之间保持灵活性。结合空间和时间原则，临时部署能接近最优永久部署的性能。

Abstract: Data on citywide street-segment traffic volumes are essential for urban planning and sustainable mobility management. Yet such data are available only for a limited subset of streets due to the high costs of sensor deployment and maintenance. Traffic volumes on the remaining network are therefore interpolated based on existing sensor measurements. However, current sensor locations are often determined by administrative priorities rather than by data-driven optimization, leading to biased coverage and reduced estimation performance. This study provides a large-scale, real-world benchmarking of easily implementable, data-driven strategies for optimizing the placement of permanent and temporary traffic sensors, using segment-level data from Berlin (Strava bicycle counts) and Manhattan (taxi counts). It compares spatial placement strategies based on network centrality, spatial coverage, feature coverage, and active learning. In addition, the study examines temporal deployment schemes for temporary sensors. The findings highlight that spatial placement strategies that emphasize even spatial coverage and employ active learning achieve the lowest prediction errors. With only 10 sensors, they reduce the mean absolute error by over 60% in Berlin and 70% in Manhattan compared to alternatives. Temporal deployment choices further improve performance: distributing measurements evenly across weekdays reduces error by an additional 7% in Berlin and 21% in Manhattan. Together, these spatial and temporal principles allow temporary deployments to closely approximate the performance of optimally placed permanent deployments. From a policy perspective, the results indicate that cities can substantially improve data usefulness by adopting data-driven sensor placement strategies, while retaining flexibility in choosing between temporary and permanent deployments.

Abstract: Rotating bearings play an important role in modern industries, but have a high probability of occurrence of defects because they operate at high speed, high load, and poor operating environments. Therefore, if a delay time occurs when a bearing is diagnosed with a defect, this may cause economic loss and loss of life. Moreover, since the vibration sensor from which the signal is collected is highly affected by the operating environment and surrounding noise, accurate defect diagnosis in a noisy environment is also important. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and strong robustness network (LSR-Net) that is accurate in a noisy environment and enables real-time fault diagnosis. To this end, first, a denoising and feature enhancement module (DFEM) was designed to create a 3-channel 2D matrix by giving several nonlinearity to the feature-map that passed through the denoising module (DM) block composed of convolution-based denoising (CD) blocks. Moreover, adaptive pruning was applied to DM to improve denoising ability when the power of noise is strong. Second, for lightweight model design, a convolution-based efficiency shuffle (CES) block was designed using group convolution (GConv), group pointwise convolution (GPConv) and channel split that can design the model while maintaining low parameters. In addition, the trade-off between the accuracy and model computational complexity that can occur due to the lightweight design of the model was supplemented using attention mechanisms and channel shuffle. In order to verify the defect diagnosis performance of the proposed model, performance verification was conducted in a noisy environment using a vibration signal. As a result, it was confirmed that the proposed model had the best anti-noise ability compared to the benchmark models, and the computational complexity of the model was also the lowest.

Abstract: Sparse recovery methods are essential for channel estimation and localization in modern communication systems, but their reliability relies on accurate physical models, which are rarely perfectly known. Their computational complexity also grows rapidly with the dictionary dimensions in large MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose MOMPnet, a novel unfolded sparse recovery framework that addresses both the reliability and complexity challenges of traditional methods. By integrating deep unfolding with data-driven dictionary learning, MOMPnet mitigates hardware impairments while preserving interpretability. Instead of a single large dictionary, multiple smaller, independent dictionaries are employed, enabling a low-complexity multidimensional Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm. The proposed unfolded network is evaluated on realistic channel data against multiple baselines, demonstrating its strong performance and potential.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the radar detection of low observable targets with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Instead of using a multistatic radar network as counter-stealth strategy with its synchronization, costs, phase coherence, and energy consumption issues, we exploit a RIS to form a joint monostatic and bistatic configuration that can intercept the energy backscattered by the target along irrelevant directions different from the line-of-sight of the radar. Then, this energy is redirected towards the radar that capitalizes all the backscattered energy to detect the low observable target. To this end, five different detection architectures are devised that jointly process monostatic and bistatic echoes and exhibit the constant false alarm rate property at least with respect to the clutter power. To support the practical implementation, we also provide a guideline for the design of a RIS that satisfies the operating requirements of the considered application. The performance analysis is carried out in comparison with conventional detectors and shows that the proposed strategy leads to effective solutions to the detection of low observable targets.

Conclusion: LWPM为解决AI通信集成中的泛化问题提供了有前景的解决方案，通过基础模型赋能物理层，有望推动6G通信系统的发展

Abstract: AI-communication integration is widely regarded as a core enabling technology for 6G. Most existing AI-based physical-layer designs rely on task-specific models that are separately tailored to individual modules, resulting in poor generalization. In contrast, communication systems are inherently general-purpose and should support broad applicability and robustness across diverse scenarios. Foundation models offer a promising solution through strong reasoning and generalization, yet wireless-system constraints hinder a direct transfer of large language model (LLM)-style success to the wireless domain. Therefore, we introduce the concept of large wireless foundation models (LWFMs) and present a novel framework for empowering the physical layer with foundation models under wireless constraints. Specifically, we propose two paradigms for realizing LWFMs, including leveraging existing general-purpose foundation models and building novel wireless foundation models. Based on recent progress, we distill two roadmaps for each paradigm and formulate design principles under wireless constraints. We further provide case studies of LWFM-empowered wireless systems to intuitively validate their advantages. Finally, we characterize the notion of "large" in LWFMs through a multidimensional analysis of existing work and outline promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Wi-Fi tracking technology demonstrates promising potential for future smart home and intelligent family care. Currently, accurate Wi-Fi tracking methods rely primarily on fine-grained velocity features. However, such velocity-based approaches suffer from the problem of accumulative errors, making it challenging to stably track users' trajectories over a long period of time. This paper presents DuTrack, a fusion-based tracking system for stable human tracking. The fundamental idea is to leverage the ubiquitous acoustic signals in households to rectify the accumulative Wi-Fi tracking error. Theoretically, Wi-Fi sensing in line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios can be modeled as elliptical Fresnel zones and hyperbolic zones, respectively. By designing acoustic sensing signals, we are able to model the acoustic sensing zones as a series of hyperbolic clusters. We reveal how to fuse the fields of electromagnetic waves and mechanical waves, and establish the optimization equation. Next, we design a data-driven architecture to solve the aforementioned optimization equation. Experimental results show that the proposed multimodal tracking scheme exhibits superior performance. We achieve a 89.37% reduction in median tracking error compared to model-based methods and a 65.02% reduction compared to data-driven methods.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于可见光通信(VLC)和射频(RF)的异构架构用于车载雾计算系统，通过动态任务分割和卸载优化，相比单一通信方式平均任务处理延迟降低15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车载雾计算依赖射频通信，在密集车辆环境中适应性受限。需要利用VLC的抗干扰优势和RF的覆盖优势，提高任务卸载效率。

Method: 设计了VLC-RF异构架构，将计算任务动态分割并通过VLC和RF链路卸载到空闲车辆。提出了基于残差的主化最小化(RBMM)算法来优化任务卸载和计算资源分配，最小化平均任务处理延迟。

Result: 仿真结果表明，提出的异构VLC-RF架构与RBMM算法相比仅使用VLC或RF的车载雾计算系统，平均任务处理延迟降低了15%。

Conclusion: VLC-RF异构架构结合提出的优化算法能有效提升车载雾计算系统的性能，为下一代交通网络中的延迟敏感服务提供支持。

Abstract: Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is a promising paradigm for reducing the computation burden of vehicles, thus supporting delay-sensitive services in next-generation transportation networks. However, traditional VFC schemes rely on radio frequency (RF) communications, which limits their adaptability for dense vehicular environments. In this paper, a heterogeneous visible light communication (VLC)-RF architecture is designed for VFC systems to facilitate efficient task offloading. Specifically, computing tasks are dynamically partitioned and offloaded to idle vehicles via both VLC and RF links, thereby fully exploiting the interference resilience of VLC and the coverage advantage of RF. To minimize the average task processing delay (TPD), an optimization problem of task offloading and computing resource allocation is formulated, and then solved by the developed residual-based majorization-minimization (RBMM) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the heterogeneous VLC-RF architecture with the proposed algorithm achieves a 15% average TPD reduction compared to VFC systems relying solely on VLC or RF.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing technology enables non-intrusive, continuous monitoring of user locations and activities, which supports diverse smart home applications. Since different sensing tasks exhibit contextual relationships, their integration can enhance individual module performance. However, integrating sensing tasks across different research efforts faces challenges due to the absence of two key elements. The first is a unified architecture that captures the fundamental nature shared across diverse sensing tasks. The second is an extensible pipeline that can integrate sensing methodologies proposed in potential future research. This paper presents Uni-Fi, an extensible framework for multi-task Wi-Fi sensing integration. This paper makes the following contributions. First, we propose a unified theoretical framework that reveals the fundamental differences between single-task and multi-task sensing. Second, we develop a scalable sensing pipeline that automatically generates multi-task sensing solvers, enabling seamless integration of multiple sensing models. Experimental results show that Uni-Fi achieves robust performance across tasks, with a localization error of approximately 0.54 meters, 98.34 percent accuracy for activity classification, and 98.57 percent accuracy for presence detection.

Conclusion: 通过混合资源分配策略，可以在双基地ISAC系统中有效平衡通信与感知需求，为未来感知网络提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables efficient reuse of the existing cellular infrastructure and is likely to play an important role in future sensing networks. In this context, ISAC using the data channel is a promising approach to improve the bistatic sensing performance compared to relying solely on pilots. One of the challenges associated with this approach is resource allocation: the communication link aims to transmit higher modulation order (MO) symbols to maximize the throughput, whereas a lower MO is preferable for sensing to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the radar image. To address this conflict, this paper introduces a hybrid resource allocation scheme. By placing lower MO symbols as pseudo-pilots on a suitable sensing grid, we enhance the bistatic sensing performance while only slightly reducing the spectral efficiency of the communication link. Simulation results validate our approach against different baselines and provide practical insights into how decoding errors affect the sensing performance.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出CR-DMD框架，通过两阶段凸优化方法增强DMD对混合噪声的鲁棒性，包括噪声去除预处理和基于稀疏加权和的降维表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DMD依赖最小二乘估计计算线性时间演化算子，在噪声条件下性能显著下降。现有鲁棒变体通常修改最小二乘公式，但仍不稳定且无法保证低维表示的真实性。

Method: 1) 基于凸优化的预处理方法去除混合噪声，实现准确稳定的模态提取；2) 新的凸优化降维公式，通过稀疏加权和将鲁棒提取的模态与原始噪声观测明确关联，构建原始数据的忠实表示。两阶段均采用预条件原始对偶分裂法高效求解。

Result: 在流体动力学数据集上的实验表明，CR-DMD在噪声条件下的模态准确性和低维表示保真度方面持续优于最先进的鲁棒DMD方法。

Conclusion: CR-DMD通过鲁棒化整个DMD流程（从模态提取到降维），有效解决了混合噪声下的性能退化问题，为动态系统分析提供了更可靠的框架。

Abstract: We propose Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CR-DMD), a novel framework that robustifies the entire DMD process - from mode extraction to dimensional reduction - against mixed noise. Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes. Both stages are efficiently solved by a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets demonstrate that CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in terms of mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions.

Motivation: 开发一种可扩展的毫米波可重构智能表面，解决传统方法在带宽、相位控制范围和响应速度方面的限制，同时实现低功耗和高效率。

Method: 采用延迟线架构，将相位控制层和辐射层解耦，使用4.6微米厚的液晶层，通过列向偏置控制，制造了120和750个单元的两种原型。

Result: 测量显示波束可控制在±60°范围内，-3 dB带宽超过9%，单元功耗为纳瓦级，模拟预测孔径效率超过20%，实测效率为9.2%和2.6%。

Conclusion: 延迟线架构的液晶可重构智能表面在带宽、相位控制和可扩展性方面优于传统方法，虽然实测效率因实验室技术挑战而降低，但架构具有优越潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of broadband liquid crystal (LC) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) operating around 60 GHz and scaling up to 750 radiating elements. The RISs employ a delay line architecture (DLA) that decouples the phase shifting and radiating layer, enabling wide bandwidth, continuous phase control exceeding 360°, and fast response times with a micrometer-thin LC layer of 4.6 micrometer. Two prototypes with 120 and 750 elements are realized using identical unit cells and column-wise biasing. Measurements demonstrate beam steering over +-60° and -3 dB bandwidths exceeding 9% for both apertures, confirming the scalability of the proposed architecture. On top of a measured nanowatt power consumption per unit cell, aperture efficiencies above 20% are predicted by simulations. While the measured efficiencies are reduced to 9.2% and 2.6%, a detailed analysis verifies that this reduction can be attributed to technological challenges in a laboratory environment. Finally, a comprehensive comparison between the applied DLA-based LC-RIS and a conventional approach highlights the superior potential of applied architecture.

Abstract: This paper studies microfluidic molecular communication receivers with finite-capacity Langmuir adsorption driven by an effective surface concentration. In the reaction-limited regime, we derive a closed-form single-pulse response kernel and a symbol-rate recursion for on-off keying that explicitly exposes channel memory and inter-symbol interference. We further develop short-pulse and long-pulse approximations, revealing an interference asymmetry in the long-pulse regime due to saturation. To account for stochasticity, we adopt a finite-receptor binomial counting model, employ pulse-end sampling, and propose a low-complexity midpoint-threshold detector that reduces to a fixed threshold when interference is negligible. Numerical results corroborate the proposed characterization and quantify detection performance versus pulse and symbol durations.

Conclusion: 提出的全模拟域LS和MMSE信道估计方案有效解决了MiLAC辅助MIMO系统的信道估计问题，验证了方案的优越性和可行性

Abstract: Microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for future gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, enabling beamforming with greatly reduced hardware and computational cost. However, channel estimation for MiLAC-aided systems remains an open problem. Conventional least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation rely on intensive digital computation, which undermines the benefits offered by MiLACs. In this letter, we propose efficient LS and MMSE channel estimation schemes for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. By designing training precoders and combiners implemented by MiLACs, both LS and MMSE estimation are performed fully in the analog domain, achieving identical performance to their digital counterparts while significantly reducing computational complexity, transmit RF chains, analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) resolution requirements, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Numerical results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed schemes.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了硬随机几何图(RGG)的熵，推导了在单位立方体和单位环面上不同连接半径下的熵上界，并在某些情况下得到了精确的渐近特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机几何图是空间网络的常用模型，但对其信息论特性（特别是熵）的研究相对较少。理解RGG的熵有助于量化其结构复杂性和信息内容，对网络分析和信息理论有重要意义。

Method: 通过分析硬随机几何图的生成过程：在d维单位立方体[0,1]^d和d维单位环面𝕋^d上随机放置m个点，当两点距离小于连接半径r时连接边。推导熵的上界，并在某些情况下证明紧下界以获得精确渐近特征。

Conclusion: 该研究为随机几何图的熵提供了理论分析框架，揭示了其渐近行为特征。对于未覆盖的情况，作者推测熵的行为渐近于推导出的上界主导项，为后续研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the entropy of a hard random geometric graph (RGG), a commonly used model for spatial networks, where the connectivity is governed by the distances between the nodes. Formally, given a connection range $r$, a hard RGG $G_m$ on $m$ vertices is formed by drawing $m$ random points from a spatial domain, and then connecting any two points with an edge when they are within a distance $r$ from each other. The two domains we consider are the $d$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^d$ and the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. We derive upper bounds on the entropy $H(G_m)$ for both these domains and for all possible values of $r$. In a few cases, we obtain an exact asymptotic characterization of the entropy by proving a tight lower bound. Our main results are that $H(G_m) \sim dm \log_2m$ for $0 < r \leq 1/4$ in the case of $\mathbb{T}^d$ and that the entropy of a one-dimensional RGG on $[0,1]$ behaves like $m\log m$ for all $0<r<1$. As a consequence, we can infer that the asymptotic structural entropy of an RGG on $\mathbb{T}^d$, which is the entropy of an unlabelled RGG, is $Ω((d-1)m \log_2m)$ for $0 < r \leq 1/4$. For the rest of the cases, we conjecture that the entropy behaves asymptotically as the leading order terms of our derived upper bounds.

Abstract: In antiquity, the seal embodied trust, secrecy, and integrity in safeguarding the exchange of letters and messages. The purpose of this work is to continue this tradition in the contemporary era, characterized by the presence of quantum computers, classical supercomputers, and increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence. We introduce Z-Sigil, an asymmetric public-key cryptographic algorithm grounded in functional analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology, with the explicit goal of achieving resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. The construction operates over the tangent fiber bundle of a compact Calabi-Yau manifold [13], where cryptographic keys are elements of vector tangent fibers, with a binary operation defined on tangent spaces of the base manifold giving rise to a groupoid structure. Encryption and decryption are performed iteratively on message blocks, enforcing a serial architecture designed to limit quantum parallelism [9,10]. Each block depends on secret geometric and analytic data, including a randomly chosen base point on the manifold, a selected section of the tangent fiber bundle, and auxiliary analytic data derived from operator determinants and Zeta function regularization [11]. The correctness and invertibility of the proposed algorithm are proven analytically. Furthermore, any adversarial attempt to recover the plaintext without the private key leads to an exponential growth of the adversarial search space,even under quantum speedups. The use of continuous geometric structures,non-linear operator compositions,and enforced blockwise serialization distinguishes this approach from existing quantum-safe cryptographic proposals based on primary discrete algebraic assumptions.

Abstract: In the emerging paradigm of edge inference, neural networks (NNs) are partitioned across distributed edge devices that collaboratively perform inference via wireless transmission. However, standard NNs are generally trained in a noiseless environment, creating a mismatch with the noisy channels during edge deployment. In this paper, we address this issue by characterizing the channel-induced performance deterioration as a generalization error against unseen channels. We introduce an augmented NN model that incorporates channel statistics directly into the weight space, allowing us to derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that explicitly quantifies the impact of wireless distortion. We further provide closed-form expressions for practical channels to demonstrate the tractability of these bounds. Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose a channel-aware training algorithm that minimizes a surrogate objective based on the derived bound. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve inference accuracy by leveraging channel statistics, without end-to-end re-training.

Conclusion: 该框架为自主多智能体系统中的量子增强语义通信提供了严格的理论基础，建立了量子信息论与语义通信之间的深刻联系，展示了量子资源（如纠缠）在克服语义歧义方面的优势。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SC) enables bandwidth-efficient coordination in multi-agent systems by transmitting meaning rather than raw bits. However, when agents employ heterogeneous sensing modalities and AI architectures, perfect bit-level transmission no longer guarantees mutual understanding. Although deep learning methods for semantic compression have advanced, the information-theoretic limits of semantic alignment under heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Notably, semantic ambiguity shares the same mathematical structure as quantum contextuality, as both arise from cohomological obstructions, motivating a quantum formulation of SC. In this paper, an information-theoretic framework for quantum semantic communication is proposed using sheaf cohomology. Multi-agent semantic networks are modeled as quantum sheaves, where agents meaning spaces are Hilbert spaces connected by quantum channels. The first sheaf cohomology group is shown to characterize irreducible semantic ambiguity, representing a fundamental obstruction to alignment that no local processing can resolve. The minimum communication rate required for semantic alignment is proven to scale with the logarithm of the dimension of the cohomological space, establishing a semantic analog of Shannon limits. For entanglement-assisted channels, the achievable capacity is shown to strictly exceed classical bounds, with each shared ebit reducing the required classical communication by one bit, providing a rigorous interpretation of shared context. Additionally, quantum contextuality is shown to reduce cohomological obstructions, and a duality between quantum discord and integrated semantic information is established, linking quantum correlations to irreducible semantic content. This framework provides rigorous foundations for quantum-enhanced semantic communication in autonomous multi-agent systems.

Result: 对于i.i.d.源，2状态的AEDS在Huffman树根节点子节点概率大于0.61803时，平均码长优于Huffman码；5状态时阈值为0.56984。推导了AEDS和tANS的平均码长上界，并证明最优AEDS/tANS的平均码长以O(1/N)速度收敛到源熵。

Conclusion: AEDS是tANS的有效推广，具有更广泛的编码类别和更好的压缩性能。该方案为无损数据压缩提供了新的理论框架，在特定条件下能超越Huffman编码的性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lossless data compression coding scheme named an asymmetric encoding-decoding scheme (AEDS), which can be considered as a generalization of tANS (tabled variant of asymmetric numeral systems). In the AEDS, a data sequence $\bm{s}=s_1s_2\cdots s_n$ is encoded in backward order $s_t, t=n, \cdots, 2,1$, while $\bm{s}$ is decoded in forward order $s_t, t=1, 2, \cdots, n$ in the same way as the tANS. But, the code class of the AEDS is much broader than that of the tANS. We show for i.i.d.~sources that an AEDS with 2 states (resp.~5 states) can attain a shorter average code length than the Huffman code if a child of the root in the Huffman code tree has a probability weight larger than 0.61803 (resp.~0.56984). Furthermore, we derive several upper bounds on the average code length of the AEDS, which also hold for the tANS, and we show that the average code length of the optimal AEDS and tANS with $N$ states converges to the source entropy with speed $O(1/N)$ as $N$ increases.

TL;DR: 提出感知嵌入地图(PEM)，一种结合无线信道统计与时空流量模式的联合表示框架，用于5G/6G网络在动态环境下的低开销决策优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G/6G网络需要在严格延迟、能耗和频谱约束下做出动态决策，这依赖于对无线信道时空变化和流量需求的先验知识。现有方法缺乏对信道和流量的联合表示，且构建成本高。

Method: 提出感知嵌入地图(PEM)框架，将细粒度信道统计与基站覆盖范围内的网格级时空流量模式联合嵌入。使用标准兼容测量数据（如测量报告、调度/QoS日志）构建，实现低成本大规模部署。

Result: PEM能够支持跨PHY、MAC和网络层的环境感知优化，显著降低训练开销和信令。相比现有站点特定信道地图和数字孪生副本，PEM强调信道-流量联合嵌入和基于标准测量的实用构建。

Conclusion: PEM为5G/6G网络提供了一种低成本、可扩展的联合信道-流量表示框架，支持网络自主优化，在保真度和成本之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: With 5G deployment and the evolution toward 6G, mobile networks must make decisions in highly dynamic environments under strict latency, energy, and spectrum constraints. Achieving this goal, however, depends on prior knowledge of spatial-temporal variations in wireless channels and traffic demands. This motivates a joint, site-specific representation of radio propagation and user demand that is queryable at low online overhead. In this work, we propose the perception embedding map (PEM), a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics together with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns over a base station's coverage. PEM is built from standard-compliant measurements -- such as measurement report and scheduling/quality-of-service logs -- so it can be deployed and maintained at scale with low cost. Integrated into PEM, this joint knowledge supports enhanced environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling. Compared with existing site-specific channel maps and digital-twin replicas, PEM distinctively emphasizes (i) joint channel-traffic embedding, which is essential for network optimization, and (ii) practical construction using standard measurements, enabling network autonomy while striking a favorable fidelity-cost balance.

Conclusion: 该研究为实际ISAC系统中混合信号的感知能力量化提供了理论框架和优化设计，填补了现有研究空白。

Abstract: The recent emergence of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework has sparked significant interest in quantifying the sensing capabilities inherent in communication signals. However, existing literature has mainly focused on scenarios involving either purely random or purely deterministic waveforms. This overlooks a critical reality: operational communication standards invariably utilize a hybrid structure comprising both deterministic pilots for channel estimation and random payloads for data transmission. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the sensing mutual information (SMI) and precoding design specifically for ISAC systems employing communication signals with both pilots and data payloads. First, by utilizing random matrix theory (RMT), we derive a tractable closed-form expression for the SMI that accurately accounts for the statistical properties of the hybrid signal. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we formulate a precoding optimization problem to maximize SMI with constraints on the transmit power and communication rate, which is solved via an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers framework. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed precoding design over conventional benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常假设视距相位完美已知或完全未知，但实际中由于硬件损伤、移动性和同步误差，相位估计存在残余不确定性。需要建立一个更现实的模型来评估无小区大规模MIMO网络在实际相位跟踪限制下的性能。

Method: 提出了一种Rician衰落模型，其中视距分量通过不完善的相位估计进行旋转，并由确定性相位误差惩罚因子衰减。推导了考虑统计相位误差的线性MMSE信道估计器，并引入了保持信道估计二阶统计特性的虚拟上行链路模型，从而开发了可处理的集中式和分布式MMSE波束成形器。

Result: 数值结果表明，该框架能够桥接理想化假设和实际跟踪限制，为6G无小区网络提供严格的性能基准和设计见解。提出的信道估计器统一了先前结果，在完美相位知识下退化为贝叶斯MMSE估计器，在无相位知识时退化为零均值模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估实际无小区大规模MIMO网络性能提供了更现实的框架，考虑了不完善的视距相位跟踪，对6G网络的设计和性能评估具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: We study the impact of imperfect line-of-sight (LoS) phase tracking on the performance of cell-free massive MIMO networks. Unlike prior works that assume perfectly known or completely unknown phases, we consider a realistic regime where LoS phases are estimated with residual uncertainty due to hardware impairments, mobility, and synchronization errors. To this end, we propose a Rician fading model where LoS components are rotated by imperfect phase estimates and attenuated by a deterministic phase-error penalty factor. We derive a linear MMSE channel estimator that captures statistical phase errors and unifies prior results, reducing to the Bayesian MMSE estimator with perfect phase knowledge and to a zero-mean model in the absence of phase knowledge. To address the non-Gaussian setting, we introduce a virtual uplink model that preserves second-order statistics of channel estimation, enabling the derivation of tractable centralized and distributed MMSE beamformers. To ensure fair assessment of the network performance, we apply these beamformers to the true uplink model and compute the spectral efficiency bounds available in the literature. Numerical results show that our framework bridges idealized assumptions and practical tracking limitations, providing rigorous performance benchmarks and design insights for 6G cell-free networks.

Motivation: 图像和视频压缩等实际应用中，不仅需要压缩后的序列失真小，还要求其分布与原始序列相似（感知质量）。传统研究多关注单序列压缩，本文将其推广到Gray-Wyner多终端系统，同时处理两个相关信源序列的失真和感知约束。

Method: 在编码和解码过程中直接引入随机循环移位算子，将失真分析和感知约束分析相结合。通过互信息项（涉及公共信息）和两个条件率-失真-感知函数来描述最优权衡。

Result: 推导出Gray-Wyner系统在失真和感知约束下的最优率-失真-感知区域，这是该多终端系统的首个一阶渐近最优解。

Conclusion: 本文成功将点对点系统的率-失真-感知分析推广到Gray-Wyner多终端系统，为相关信源序列的联合压缩提供了理论框架，在编码过程中直接集成随机循环移位算子实现了失真和感知约束的统一分析。

Abstract: We revisit the Gray-Wyner lossy source coding problem and derive the first-order asymptotic optimal rate-distortion-perception region when additional perception constraints are imposed on reproduced source sequences. The optimal trade-off is shown to be governed by a mutual information term involving common information and two conditional rate-distortion-perception functions. The perception constraint requires that the distribution of each reproduced sequence is close to that of the original source sequence, which is motivated by practical applications in image and video compression. Prior studies usually focus on the compression and reconstruction of a single source sequence. In this paper, we generalize the prior results for point-to-point systems to the representative multi-terminal setting of the Gray-Wyner problem with two correlated source sequences. In particular, we integrate the analyses of the distortion and the perception constraints by including the random circular shift operator in the encoding and decoding process directly.

Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) enhances wireless coverage through directional gain steering, yet suffers from performance degradation under physical blockages. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) establishes reflective paths to bypass obstacles, but suffers from angular mismatch when deployed in the side-lobe region of base station (BS) antennas. To address this issue, we propose a new RA-enabled IRS-assisted multi-user uplink system, in which the BS antennas are capable of flexibly adjusting their 3D orientations to align their boresights with the IRS. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the antenna 3D rotations, receive beamforming and IRS phase shifts. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively update the antenna rotations via projected gradient ascent (PGA), compute the receive beamforming via a closed-form solution, and optimize the IRS phase shifts via fractional programming (FP). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system yields significant performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems, especially under large angular misalignments.

We derive the achievable capacity, the achievable representation-rate, and their converse. Finally, we combine the results in a unified setting.

TL;DR: 提出Polar Orbit Decoding (POD)框架，通过并行解码二进制线性分组码的自同构轨道，在保持ML性能的同时显著降低解码延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二进制线性分组码(BLBCs)没有单一码族能同时优化所有性能，导致标准中广泛使用多码架构，需要多个解码器，硬件复杂度高。虽然已有基于极化变换的通用解码框架，但其并行化尚未讨论。

Method: 提出Polar Orbit Decoding (POD)框架：1) 识别BLBCs的自同构生成置换轨道，在极化变换后产生具有相同动态冻结约束的多样化解码轨迹；2) 并行解码自同构轨道，无需重新调整冻结集或额外穷举置换搜索；3) 使用Schreier-Sims算法以基和强生成集(BSGS)形式表示自同构群，实现多项式时间的离线系统计算。

Result: 在扩展BCH码和扩展Golay码上的仿真结果表明，POD能够达到最大似然性能，同时相比传统的连续取消列表解码显著降低解码延迟。

Conclusion: POD为二进制线性分组码提供了一个通用的并行解码框架，通过利用自同构轨道实现延迟与性能的权衡，无需复杂的冻结集调整或置换搜索，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Binary linear block codes (BLBCs) form the foundation of modern communication systems, yet no single code family simultaneously optimizes all performance aspects. This leads to the widely used multi-code architecture in the standard, significantly increasing the hardware complexity since multiple decoders are required in each piece of equipment. A universal decoding framework based on polar transformations has recently been proposed to unify BLBC decoding under polar-style decoders, but its parallelization has not yet been discussed. In this work, we propose Polar Orbit Decoding (POD), a universal parallel decoding framework for BLBCs. We identify that the automorphisms of BLBCs generate an orbit of permutations that induce diverse decoding trajectories with identical dynamic-frozen constraints after the polar transformations. By decoding over this automorphism orbit in parallel, POD achieves substantial latency-performance tradeoffs without requiring frozen-set readaptation or extra exhaustive permutation searches. Moreover, to enable efficient orbit traversal in the implementation, we represent the automorphism group in a base and strong generating set (BSGS) form using Schreier-Sims algorithms, making offline systematic computation accessible in polynomial time. Simulation results on extended BCH and extended Golay codes demonstrate that POD can achieve maximum-likelihood performance while significantly reducing the decoding latency compared to conventional successive cancellation list decoding.

Motivation: 研究如何通过Walsh-Hadamard交错转换实现能量高效的宽带通信，利用模拟WH变换降低高采样率模数转换的功耗，同时使端到端训练的神经编码调制能够透明适应硬件而无需算法重新设计。

Method: 提出WH域自动编码器系统，在短块长度下训练WH域AE，并与标准神经基线和传统基线（包括5G Polar码）进行基准测试。量化基带计算、信道信噪比和模拟转换器功耗之间的系统级能量权衡。

Result: WH-AE系统能够在0.14dB内接近传统Polar码的SNR性能，同时消耗相当或更低的系统功率。与最佳神经基线相比，WH-AE在相同可靠性下平均实现29%更高的能量效率（bit/J）。

Conclusion: WH域学习通过明确平衡计算复杂度、SNR和模拟功耗，为能量高效、高吞吐量的宽带通信提供了可行路径。

Abstract: This paper investigates how end-to-end (E2E) channel autoencoders (AEs) can achieve energy-efficient wideband communications by leveraging Walsh-Hadamard (WH) interleaved converters. WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.

Abstract: An important part of the information theory folklore had been about the output statistics of codes that achieve the capacity and how the empirical distributions compare to the output distributions induced by the optimal input in the channel capacity problem. Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case. We also extend non-vanishing error probability results to the quantum case on block codes, by using the second-order converses for such codes based on hypercontractivity results for the quantum generalized depolarizing semi-groups.

Conclusion: 提出的标记嵌入编码方案能有效解决DNA存储中的噪声撕裂纸信道问题，主要受计算资源限制，但实现了高重建率。

Abstract: To make DNA a suitable medium for archival data storage, it is essential to consider the decay process of the strands observed in DNA storage systems. This paper studies the decay process as a probabilistic noisy torn paper channel (TPC), which first corrupts the bits of the transmitted sequence in a probabilistic manner by substitutions, then breaks the sequence into a set of noisy unordered substrings. The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels. Both approaches achieve reconstruction rates exceeding $99\%$ with no false decodings observed, primarily limited by computational resources.

Abstract: We study joint source-channel coding over Markov channels through the empirical coordination framework. More specifically, we aim at determining the empirical distributions of source and channel symbols that can be induced by a coding scheme. We consider strictly causal encoders that generate channel inputs, without access to the past channel states, henceforth driving the current Markov state evolution. Our main result is the single-letter inner and outer bounds of the set of achievable joint distributions, coordinating all the symbols in the network. To establish the inner bound, we introduce a new notion of typicality, the input-driven Markov typicality, and develop its fundamental properties. Contrary to the classical block-Markov coding schemes that rely on blockwise independence for discrete memoryless channels, our analysis directly exploits the Markov channel structure and improves beyond the independence-based arguments.
