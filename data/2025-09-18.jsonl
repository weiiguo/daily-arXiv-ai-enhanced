FL, WPT, multi-antenna AP, and RIS\ncan mitigate these challenges by reducing the need for large data\ntransmissions, enabling sustainable energy harvesting, and optimizing the\npropagation environment. Compared to conventional RIS, STAR-RIS not only\nextends coverage from half-space to full-space but also improves energy saving\nthrough appropriate mode selection. Motivated by the need for sustainable,\nlow-latency, and energy-efficient communication in large-scale IoT networks,\nthis paper investigates the efficient STAR-RIS mode in the uplink and downlink\nphases of a WPT-FL multi-antenna AP network with non-orthogonal multiple access\nto minimize energy consumption, a joint optimization that remains largely\nunexplored in existing works on RIS or STAR-RIS. We formulate a non-convex\nenergy minimization problem for different STAR-RIS modes, i.e., energy\nsplitting (ES) and time switching (TS), in both uplink and downlink\ntransmission phases, where STAR-RIS phase shift vectors, beamforming matrices,\ntime and power for harvesting, uplink transmission, and downlink transmission,\nlocal processing time, and computation frequency for each user are jointly\noptimized. To tackle the non-convexity, the problem is decoupled into two\nsubproblems: the first subproblem optimizes STAR-RIS phase shift vectors and\nbeamforming matrices across all WPT-FL phases using block coordinate descent\nover either semi-definite programming or Rayleigh quotient problems, while the\nsecond one allocates time, power, and computation frequency via the\none-dimensional search algorithms or the bisection algorithm."}

In these configurations, the\nsystem achieves a coherent gain over an incoherent network of N nodes,\nsignificantly improving the relevant signal power ratios. Our system\ndemonstrates extended array phase coherence times, enabling advanced\ntechniques. Results from over-the-air experiments demonstrate a 14.3 dB\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise improvement in interference-laden scenarios\nwith a contributing 13.5 dB null towards interference in receive beamforming.\nIn transmit nulling, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 7.9 dB is measured\ntowards an intended receiver while maintaining an SNR reduction of 8.9 dB at\nanother receiver. These findings represent the use of distributed coherence in\nthe V band without the use of GPS timing."}

A critical\nchallenge is the estimation of the cascaded base station (BS)-RIS-user channel,\nsince the passive nature of RIS elements prevents direct channel acquisition,\nincurring prohibitive pilot overhead, computational complexity, and energy\nconsumption. To address this, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based channel\nestimation framework that reduces pilot overhead by grouping RIS elements and\nreconstructing the cascaded channel from partial pilot observations.\nFurthermore, conventional DL models trained under single-user settings suffer\nfrom poor generalization across new user locations and propagation scenarios.\nWe develop a distributed machine learning (DML) strategy in which the BS and\nusers collaboratively train a shared neural network using diverse channel\ndatasets collected across the network, thereby achieving robust generalization.\nBuilding on this foundation, we design a hierarchical DML neural architecture\nthat first classifies propagation conditions and then employs scenario-specific\nfeature extraction to further improve estimation accuracy. Simulation results\nconfirm that the proposed framework substantially reduces pilot overhead and\ncomplexity while outperforming conventional methods and single-user models in\nchannel estimation accuracy. These results demonstrate the practicality and\neffectiveness of the proposed approach for 6G RIS-assisted systems."}

In this paper, we investigate a widely adopted\n``convex-relaxation-then-quantization\" approach for nonlinear symbol-level\none-bit precoding. Specifically, we first solve a convex relaxation of the\ndiscrete minimum mean square error precoding problem, and then quantize the\nsolution to satisfy the one-bit constraint. To analyze the high-dimensional\nasymptotic performance of this scheme, we develop a novel analytical framework\nbased on approximate message passing (AMP). This framework enables us to derive\na closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) at the receiver\nside in the large-system limit, which provides a quantitative characterization\nof how model and system parameters affect the SEP performance. Our empirical\nresults suggest that the $\\ell_\\infty^2$ regularizer, when paired with an\noptimally chosen regularization parameter, achieves optimal SEP performance\nwithin a broad class of convex regularization functions.
