Abstract: Deep learning-based radio frequency fingerprinting (RFFP) has become an
enabling physical-layer security technology, allowing device identification and
authentication through received RF signals. This technology, however, faces
significant challenges when it comes to adapting to domain variations, such as
time, location, environment, receiver and channel. For Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) devices, addressing these challenges is particularly crucial due to the
BLE protocol's frequency-hopping nature. In this work, and for the first time,
we investigated the frequency hopping effect on RFFP of BLE devices, and
proposed a novel, low-cost, domain-adaptive feature extraction method. Our
approach improves the classification accuracy by up to 58\% across environments
and up to 80\% across receivers compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly
reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we
study a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system enhanced with movable
antennas. To ensure communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable
sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors, receiving
filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
performance and transmission covertness constraints. To tackle this challenging
optimization problem, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation process
to reformulate it into a more tractable form. Subsequently, the problem is
solved by introducing a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, incorporating
semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), and successive
convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a
satisfactory balance between the communication and radar performance compared
with existing benchmark schemes by leveraging the flexibility of movable
antennas.

### [3] [Active IRS Assisted Joint Uplink and Downlink Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10045)
*Qiaoyan Peng,Qingqing Wu,Guangji Chen,Wen Chen,Shaodan Ma*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了有源智能反射表面(AIRS)辅助的无线通信系统，通过联合优化基站波束成形、AIRS波束成形和AIRS单元分配来最大化上下行链路的加权和速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无源智能反射表面(PIRS)存在双衰落效应，而有源智能反射表面(AIRS)能够放大反射信号，克服这一限制。本文旨在探索AIRS在不同部署方案下的性能优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided
wireless communication system, where active IRSs (AIRSs) are deployed to assist
communication between a base station (BS) and users of both the uplink (UL) and
downlink (DL). We aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of UL and DL
communications through joint optimization of BS, AIRS beamforming, and AIRS
element allocation. First, we study three deployment schemes, namely
distributed AIRSs, BS-side AIRS, and user-side AIRS. For distributed AIRSs,
both optimal and near-optimal solutions are derived in closed form. To draw
useful insights, we analytically compare the deployment schemes in terms of the
rate performance under the single-user setup. For the multi-user case, we
consider two beamforming setups at the distributed AIRSs to balance performance
and complexity tradeoffs. Regarding the user-adaptive AIRS beamforming,
different AIRS beamforming vectors are adopted for each user; while for the
static AIRS beamforming, all users share the same beamforming vectors, with
identical phase shifts but different amplitudes for UL and DL. With the
user-adaptive AIRS beamforming, we focus on the optimization of element
allocation for rate maximization. With static AIRS beamforming, we solve the
rate maximization problem by optimizing the BS transmit/receive beamformers,
user beamforming, and AIRS beamforming. Despite its non-convexity, we develop
an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm that solves each
sub-problem optimally. Numerical results validate the practical advantages of
distributed AIRSs compared to passive IRS (PIRS), BS-side AIRS, and user-side
AIRS, and highlight the benefits of dynamic IRS beamforming.

### [4] [MIMO Radar Meets Polarization-Reconfigurable Antennas: A BCRB Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10235)
*Jinpeng Xu,Shuowen Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相位可重构天线的MIMO雷达系统，通过联合优化发射协方差矩阵和相位偏移向量来最小化贝叶斯克拉美罗下界，从而提高目标角度定位的估计精度。

Conclusion: 基于相位可重构天线的MIMO雷达系统通过联合优化设计能够充分利用新的自由度，显著改善目标感知性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
radar system aided by phase shifter based polarization-reconfigurable antennas
(PRAs). Specifically, a base station (BS) equipped with multiple PRAs at both
the transmitter and the receiver aims to sense the unknown and random angular
location parameter of a point target via sending wireless signals and
processing the received echo signals reflected by the target, where only prior
distribution information about the location parameter is available for
exploitation. Firstly, we characterize the sensing performance of this novel
PRA-based MIMO radar system by deriving the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB)
of the mean-squared error (MSE) in estimating the desired location parameter
with prior distribution information. Then, to fully exploit the new design
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) empowered by PRAs, we study the joint optimization of
the transmit sample covariance matrix as well as the transmit and receive phase
shift vectors to minimize the sensing BCRB subject to a transmit power
constraint. This problem is non-convex and difficult to solve due to the
coupling among optimization variables. To resolve this issue, we develop an
alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm which iteratively obtains the
closed-form optimal solution to each variable with the others being fixed at
each time, thus being guaranteed to converge to at least a stationary point of
the joint optimization problem. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm.

### [5] [Synchrosqueezed windowed linear canonical transform: A method for mode retrieval from multicomponent signals with crossing instantaneous frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10438)

Result: WLCT提供了新的三维时频-调频率表示方法，能够有效处理信号在时频域的重叠问题。

Conclusion: WLCT在三维信号分离方面具有巨大潜力，为处理非平稳信号叠加问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In nature, signals often appear in the form of the superposition of multiple
non-stationary signals. The overlap of signal components in the time-frequency
domain poses a significant challenge for signal analysis. One approach to
addressing this problem is to introduce an additional chirprate parameter and
use the chirplet transform (CT) to elevate the two-dimensional time-frequency
representation to a three-dimensional time-frequency-chirprate representation.
From a certain point of view, the CT of a signal can be regarded as a windowed
special linear canonical transform of that signal, undergoing a shift and a
modulation.
  In this paper, we develop this idea to propose a novel windowed linear
canonical transform (WLCT), which provides a new time-frequency-chirprate
representation. We discuss four types of WLCTs. In addition, we use a special
X-ray transform to further sharpen the time-frequency-chirprate representation.
Furthermore, we derive the corresponding three-dimensional synchrosqueezed
transform, demonstrating that the WLCTs have great potential for
three-dimensional signal separation.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种五能级多载波里德堡原子量子接收器(MC-RAQR)，解决了传统RAQR带宽受限问题，实现了14MHz带宽，比传统RAQR提升56倍，显著提高了多载波通信和感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统里德堡原子量子接收器(RAQR)由于原子能级的离散性和固有瞬时带宽限制，无法准确接收宽带射频信号，这限制了其在多载波通信和感知中的应用。

Method: 提出五能级多载波里德堡原子量子接收器结构，推导其幅度和相位响应，提取基带电信号进行处理，分析信道容量以及到达角和距离参数的估计精度。

Conclusion: MC-RAQR与OFDM等波形兼容，在多载波信号接收方面具有显著优势，显著提升了多载波通信和感知性能。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have attracted significant attention
in recent years due to their ultra-high sensitivity. Although capable of
precisely detecting the amplitude and phase of weak signals, conventional RAQRs
face inherent limitations in accurately receiving wideband RF signals, due to
the discrete nature of atomic energy levels and their intrinsic instantaneous
bandwidth constraints. These limitations hinder their direct application to
multi-carrier communication and sensing. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a multi-carrier Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (MC-RAQR) structure
with five energy levels. We derive the amplitude and phase of the MC-RAQR and
extract the baseband electrical signal for signal processing. In terms of
multi-carrier communication and sensing, we analyze the channel capacity and
accuracy of angle of arrival (AoA) and distance parameters, respectively.
Numerical results validate our proposed model, showing that the MC-RAQR can
achieve up to a bandwidth of 14 MHz, which is 56-fold larger than the
conventional RAQRs. As a result, the channel capacity and the resolution for
multi-target sensing are improved significantly. Specifically, the channel
capacity of MC-RAQR is 22-fold and 3-fold larger than the conventional antennas
and RAQRs, respectively. For sensing performance, the MSE of AoA estimation for
MC-RAQR is 0.16% of the conventional RAQR and the MSE of distance estimation is
0.01% of the CRB of conventional antennas, showing the superior performance of
the MC-RAQR. This demonstrates its compatibility with waveforms such as
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and its significant
advantages for multi-carrier signal reception.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅消除了传统策略所需的繁琐网格搜索，还显著提高了滤波系统的灵活性和训练稳定性。

Abstract: The graph linear canonical transform (GLCT)-based filtering methods often
optimize transform parameters and filters separately, which results in high
computational costs and limited stability. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a trainable joint optimization framework that combines GLCT parameters
and Wiener filtering into an end-to-end learning process, allowing for
synergistic optimization between transform domain construction and filtering
operations. The proposed method not only eliminates the cumbersome grid search
required by traditional strategies but also significantly enhances the
flexibility and training stability of the filtering system. Experimental
results on real-world graph data show the proposed method outperforms existing
methods in denoising tasks, featuring superior denoising performance, higher
robustness and lower computational complexity.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在去噪任务中显著优于传统固定矩阵方法，特别是在信噪比和带宽效率方面。

Conclusion: UGRM-GFT方法提供了灵活有效的图信号分析框架，能够适应复杂图结构，在去噪性能上表现出色。

Abstract: Traditional directed graph signal processing generally depends on fixed
representation matrices, whose rigid structures limit the model's ability to
adapt to complex graph topologies. To address this issue, this study employed
the unified graph representation matrix (UGRM) to propose a generalized graph
Fourier transform (UGRM-GFT) method based on singular value decomposition (SVD)
for signal analysis on directed graphs and Cartesian product graphs. We defined
UGRM-GFT for general directed graphs by introducing a parameterized UGRM that
incorporates traditional representations such as the Laplacian matrix and
adjacency matrix. The SVD is used to construct spectral transform pairs with
both left and right singular vectors. We extended this approach to two types of
UGRM-GFTs applied to directed Cartesian product graphs. UGRM-GFT-I performs SVD
directly on the composite UGRM matrix of the two-dimensional graph structure,
suitable for globally coupled graph signals. UGRM-GFT-II separately applies SVD
to the UGRMs of the two-factor graphs and then combines the results,
significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving spectral
expressiveness. Theoretical analysis confirmed the monotonicity of the proposed
method with respect to the parameters alpha and k embedded in the UGRM.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed
method significantly outperforms traditional fixed-matrix approaches in
denoising tasks, with a particular emphasis on signal-to-noise ratio and
bandwidth efficiency.

Abstract: This study proposes a multi-radar system for non-contact physiological

conducted with six subjects under varying distances and orientations
demonstrate that, compared with a single-radar setup, the proposed system
reduced the root mean square error of the respiratory interval by 35.5%,
decreased the mean absolute error of the respiratory rate by 30.8%, and
improved accuracy by 9.4 percentage points. These results highlight that
combining multiple radar viewpoints with signal integration enables stable
respiratory measurement regardless of body orientation.

Abstract: Accurate channel prediction and effective beamforming are essential for low
Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications to enhance system capacity and
enable high-speed connectivity. Most existing channel prediction and predictive
beamforming methods are limited by model generalization capabilities and
struggle to adapt to time-varying wireless propagation environments. Inspired
by the remarkable generalization and reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), this work proposes an LLM-based channel prediction framework,
namely CPLLM, to forecast future channel state information (CSI) for LEO
satellites based on historical CSI data. In the proposed CPLLM, a dedicated CSI
encoder is designed to map raw CSI data into the textual embedding space,
effectively bridging the modality gap and enabling the LLM to perform reliable
reasoning over CSI data. Additionally, a CSI decoder is introduced to
simultaneously predict CSI for multiple future time slots, substantially
reducing the computational burden and inference latency associated with the
inherent autoregressive decoding process of LLMs. Then, instead of training the
LLM from scratch, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e.,
LoRA, for CPLLM, where the pretrained LLM remains frozen and trainable low-rank
matrices are injected into each Transformer decoder layer to enable effective
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we extend CPLLM to directly generate beamforming
strategies for future time slots based on historical CSI data, namely BFLLM.
This extended framework retains the same architecture as CPLLM, while
introducing a dedicated beamforming decoder to output beamforming strategies.
Finally, extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approaches in channel prediction and predictive beamforming for LEO
satellite communications.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂杂波环境下的ISAC系统隐蔽波形设计问题，显著提升了系统对多普勒效应的鲁棒性，为雷达检测与无线通信的协同工作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system
covert waveform design method for complex clutter environments, with the core
objective of maximizing the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). The
design achieves efficient clutter suppression while meeting the covertness
requirement through joint optimization of the transmit waveform and receive
filter, enabling cooperative radar detection and wireless communication. This
study presents key innovations that explicitly address target Doppler shift
uncertainty, significantly enhancing system robustness against Doppler effects.
To ensure communication reliability, the method incorporates phase difference
constraints between communication signal elements in the waveform design, along
with energy constraint, covert constraint, and peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) constraint. The original non-convex optimization problem is transformed
into a tractable convex optimization form through convex optimization
technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized waveform not only
satisfies the covertness requirement in complex clutter environment, but also
achieves superior target detection performance. It also ensures reliable
communication and confirms the effectiveness of propose method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G网络研究对FR3频段的关注增加，需要了解具有数千个天线单元和射频链的新型基站架构的功耗特性及其与数据速率的关系。

Method: 建立了FR3基站的功耗模型，包括数字和模拟信号处理、功率放大器、供电和冷却系统在四个阶段（数据、信令、微睡眠和空闲）的功耗，比较了混合部分连接波束成形与全数字波束成形。

Conclusion: 混合波束成形在FR3频段基站中相比全数字波束成形具有更好的能效表现，是实现6G网络高数据速率和能效平衡的有效方案。

Abstract: Increasing attention is given to the upper mid-band or Frequency Range 3
(FR3), from 7 to 24 GHz, in the research towards sixth-generation (6G)
networks. Promises of offering large data rates at favorable propagation
conditions are leading to novel FR3 base station (BS) architectures, with up to
thousands of antenna elements and radio-frequency (RF) chains. This work
investigates the power consumption of prospective FR3 BSs and its relation to
the delivered data rates. We model the power consumed by digital and analog
signal processing, power amplifiers (PAs), and supply and cooling during four
phases (data, signaling, micro-sleep, and idle) in downlink and uplink. Hybrid
partially-connected beamforming is compared to fully-digital one. Results show
that, for BS arrays with $1024$ antennas at $30\%$ of load, the PA consumes
most of the power when $64$ or less RF chains are utilized, while the digital
and analog processing consumption takes over when the number of RF chains is
$512$ or more. The digital plus analog processing consumes $2\times$ to
$4\times$ more than the PA for fully-digital beamforming. Hybrid beamforming
achieves $1.3$ Gbit/s/user in downlink while improving the energy efficiency by
$1.4\times$ compared to fully-digital beamforming.

### [13] [HYPERDOA: Robust and Efficient DoA Estimation using Hyperdimensional Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10718)
*Rajat Bhattacharjya,Woohyeok Park,Arnab Sarkar,Hyunwoo Oh,Mohsen Imani,Nikil Dutt*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: HYPERDOA是一种基于超维计算的新型DoA估计器，在低信噪比条件下比现有方法准确度提高约35.39%，同时在嵌入式平台上能耗降低约93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DoA估计方法在低信噪比条件下精度不足，而现代深度学习方法能耗高且不透明，不适合资源受限的安全关键系统。

Method: 使用超维计算框架，引入两种特征提取策略（均值空间滞后自相关和空间平滑），将DoA估计重构为模式识别问题。

Result: 在低信噪比相干源场景下，准确度比最先进方法提高约35.39%；在嵌入式NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX平台上，能耗比神经网络基准降低约93%。

Conclusion: HYPERDOA在准确性和效率方面的双重优势，使其成为边缘设备上任务关键应用的稳健可行解决方案。

Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off,
as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too
energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems.
We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing
(HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies --
Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline,
and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This
approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent
algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and
``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our
evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it
also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded
NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and
efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for
mission-critical applications on edge devices.

Conclusion: 所提出的空间滤波稀疏贝叶斯学习框架有效解决了漏波天线在相干源环境下的波达方向估计问题。

Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation with leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) offers
a compact and cost-effective alternative to conventional antenna arrays but
remains challenging in the presence of coherent sources. To address this issue,
we propose a spatially filtered sparse Bayesian learning (SF-SBL) framework.
Firstly, the field of view (FoV) is divided into angular sectors according to
the frequency beam-scanning property of LWAs, and Bayesian inverse problems are
then solved within each sector to improve efficiency and reduce computational
cost. Both on-grid SBL and off-grid SBL formulations are developed. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach achieves robust and accurate DoA
estimation, even with coherent sources.

Abstract: Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for reliable
and efficient wireless communication, but challenges such as high pilot
overhead and channel aging hinder timely and accurate CSI acquisition. CSI
prediction, which forecasts future CSI from historical observations, offers a
promising solution. Recent deep learning approaches, including recurrent neural
networks and Transformers, have achieved notable success but typically learn
deterministic mappings, limiting their ability to capture the stochastic and
multimodal nature of wireless channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel
probabilistic framework for CSI prediction based on diffusion models, offering
a flexible design that supports integration of diverse prediction schemes. We
decompose the CSI prediction task into two components: a temporal encoder,
which extracts channel dynamics, and a diffusion-based generator, which
produces future CSI samples. We investigate two inference
schemes-autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence- and explore multiple diffusion
backbones, including U-Net and Transformer-based architectures. Furthermore, we
examine a diffusion-based approach without an explicit temporal encoder and
utilize the DDIM scheduling to reduce model complexity. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our diffusion-based models significantly outperform
state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最优空间滤波器概念的DOA估计算法SSFNS，适用于大孔径二维阵列，在少快拍、低信噪比、相干信号和未知信号数量等苛刻条件下表现优于传统方法。


<details>

Motivation: 传统DOA估计方法在苛刻条件下存在局限：常规波束形成受旁瓣干扰，自适应方法在少快拍时性能下降，子空间算法对相干信号敏感，稀疏恢复方法计算复杂度高。

Method: 构建最优空间滤波器概念，将DOA估计问题转化为最优空间滤波器求解问题，提出SSFNS算法框架来求解最优空间滤波器并获取DOA。

Result: 实验表明SSFNS算法适用于大孔径二维阵列，在少快拍、单快拍、低信噪比、相干信号和未知信号数量等场景下性能优于其他算法。

Conclusion: 基于最优空间滤波器概念的SSFNS算法为解决苛刻条件下的DOA估计问题提供了有效框架，特别适合大孔径二维阵列应用。

Abstract: Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation in sensor arrays faces limitations
under demanding conditions, including low signal-to-noise ratio,
single-snapshot scenarios, coherent sources, and unknown source counts.
Conventional beamforming suffers from sidelobe interference, adaptive methods
(e.g., MVDR) and subspace algorithms (e.g., MUSIC) degrade with limited
snapshots or coherent signals, while sparse-recovery approaches (e.g., L1-SVD)
incur high computational complexity for large arrays. In this article, we
construct the concept of the optimal spatial filter to solve the DOA estimation
problem under demanding conditions by utilizing the sparsity of spatial
signals. By utilizing the concept of the optimal spatial filter, we have
transformed the DOA estimation problem into a solution problem for the optimal
spatial filter. We propose the Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression
(SSFNS) algorithm, which is a novel DOA estimation framework grounded in the
theoretical existence of an optimal spatial filter, to solve for the optimal
spatial filter and obtain DOA. Through experiments, it was found that the
proposed algorithm is suitable for large aperture two-dimensional arrays and
experiments have shown that our proposed algorithm performs better than other
algorithms in scenarios with few snapshots or even a single snapshot, low
signal-to-noise ratio, coherent signals, and unknown signal numbers in
two-dimensional large aperture arrays.

Conclusion: ISCSC框架能够有效解决远程医疗中的感知、通信和隐私保护挑战，为现代医疗系统提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and
heartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare
systems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional
wireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the
stringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,
and privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel
integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In
the proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions
and monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.
Instead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and
communicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This
semantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical
relevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the
transmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the
robot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track
patient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and
reliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming
matrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and
power budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic
secrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC
framework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission
efficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint
sensing and communication methods.

Abstract: Pinching antennas (PAs), as an emerging flexible-antenna technology, enables
movable PAs deployed along waveguides to customize channel conditions over a
large scale. This paper investigates an application of PAs to enable
physical-layer security (PLS) by enlarging the channel condition diversity
between legitimate users (LUs) and eavesdroppers (Eves). Particularly, we focus
on the dual-waveguide scenario, where the two waveguides employs multiple PAs
to serve multiple LUs in the presence of an Eve. Specifically, we consider two
waveguide placement strategies, i.e., parallel placement and orthogonal
placement. Meanwhile, we incorporate two channel models, i.e., in-waveguide
phase shifts, and in-waveguide phase shifts and attenuation. We formulate the
secure sum rate (SSR) and secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problems,
and propose a two-stage algorithm to solve them. The first stage adopts a
particle swarm optimization (PSO) method with an improved feasibility module,
termed FeaPSO, for PA placement, and the second stage employs the successive
convex approximate (SCA) method to optimize beamforming and artificial noise
vectors. Furthermore, we conduct numerical comparisons between the two
placement strategies in terms of average performance and a special case where
an Eve is positioned in front of LUs. Numerical results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that PAs can
significantly improve both SSR and SEE. Additionally, the necessity of
orthogonal waveguide placement is explicitly verified.

Conclusion: 提出的框架克服了UatF边界的局限性，为大规模MIMO系统提供了更准确和稳健的功率控制解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal
statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO
systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF)
lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can
deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect
channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address
limitations of UatF-based algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the
UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme
cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels,
the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale
invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically,
especially when simple beamforming strategies are employed. In contrast, our
framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer
from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min
power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous
CSI at the decoder.

Result: 建立了后电磁通信的概念基础，定义了能量感知、自适应且能统一物质、生命和智能的通信系统愿景。

Conclusion: 为超越频谱受限系统限制的通信范式提供了概念基础，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) communication is nearing its physical and thermodynamic
limits, where further performance gains through spectrum optimization alone
have become increasingly unsustainable. Finite bandwidth, propagation loss at
higher frequencies, and the inherent trade-offs between energy and information
constrain the scalability of 6G and beyond systems. These limitations drive the
search for alternative mechanisms for information transfer beyond conventional
EM propagation. This work introduces a state-centric framework for post-6G
communication, in which information is conveyed by manipulating physical,
biological, and cognitive states rather than EM waves. It identifies ten
foundational paradigms that define potential carriers and interaction
mechanisms for the post-electromagnetic era and outlines a research roadmap
toward self-organizing, cognitively integrated networks. Together, these
developments envision a new class of communication systems that are
energy-aware, adaptive, and capable of uniting matter, life, and intelligence
within a single informational continuum. By establishing the conceptual basis
for this transition, the work provides a foundation for future research aimed
at realizing communication paradigms that transcend the limitations of
spectrum-bound systems.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology offers significant
promise in enhancing wireless communication systems, but its dual-use potential
also introduces substantial security risks. This survey explores the security
implications of RIS in next-generation wireless networks. We first highlight
the dual-use nature of RIS, demonstrating how its communication-enhancing
capabilities can be exploited by adversaries to compromise legitimate users. We
identify a new class of security vulnerabilities termed ``passive-active hybrid
attacks,'' where RIS, despite passively handling signals, can be reconfigured
to actively engage in malicious activities, enabling various RIS-assisted
attacks, such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, reflection
jamming, and side-channel attacks. Furthermore, we reveal how adversaries can
exploit the openness of wireless channels to introduce adversarial
perturbations in artificial intelligence-driven RIS networks, disrupting
communication terminals and causing misclassifications or errors in RIS
reflection predictions. Despite these risks, RIS technology also plays a
critical role in enhancing security and privacy across radio frequency (RF) and
visible light communication (VLC) systems. By synthesizing current insights and
highlighting emerging threats, we provide actionable insights into cross-layer
collaboration, advanced adversarial defenses, and the balance between security
and cost. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of RIS technology's
security landscape and underscores the urgent need for robust security
frameworks in the development of future wireless systems.

Result: 建立了波形感知能力的基准：OFDM具有优异的时延分辨率和旁瓣特性但多普勒响应差，而先进波形在时延和多普勒分辨率之间实现更好平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究为ISAC波形设计提供了系统性的比较基准，确认了OFDM在时延分辨率上的优势以及先进波形在时延-多普勒平衡上的改进，并公开了仿真代码以促进可重复性研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified and system-agnostic analysis of the ambiguity
function (AF) characteristics of four representative multicarrier waveforms,
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency
space (OTFS), affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), and chirp-permuted
AFDM (CP-AFDM), which are considered as key candidates for enabling integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) in future sixth generation (6G) networks. The
AF of each waveform is obtained directly from its discrete-time definition and
enhanced via ideal fractional interpolation, enabling precise characterization
of its continuous-time delay-Doppler response. Two signaling modes are
examined: a communication-oriented case with random information symbols
suitable only for monostatic scenarios, and a sensing-oriented case with fixed
unimodular symbols suitable for general multi-static scenarios. Furthermore,
the AFs and the ambiguity metrics including the 3dB mainlobe width,
peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR), and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR), are
evaluated in normalized delay-Doppler units, enabling direct translation to any
physical system configuration defined by bandwidth, sampling frequency, or
symbol duration, while ensuring straightforward and consistent comparison
across waveforms. The results establish a consistent benchmark for comparing
waveform sensing capabilities in ISAC design, consolidating known behaviors:
OFDM exhibits excellent delay resolution and sidelobe behavior but poor Doppler
response, whereas advanced waveforms achieve improved balance between delay and
Doppler resolution with varying sidelobe characteristics. The simulation code
of the smooth AFs, is openly shared to promote reproducibility and support
future ISAC waveform research.

Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) advances spectral analysis on irregular
domains. However, existing two-dimensional graph fractional Fourier transform
(2D-GFRFT) employs a single fractional order for both factor graphs, thereby
limiting its adaptability to heterogeneous signals. We proposed the
two-dimensional graph bi-fractional Fourier transform (2D-GBFRFT), which
assigns independent fractional orders to the factor graphs of a Cartesian
product while preserving separability. We established invertibility, unitarity,
and index additivity, and developed two filtering schemes: a Wiener-style
design through grid search and a differentiable framework that jointly
optimizes transform orders and diagonal spectral filters. We further introduced
a hybrid interpolation with the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform
(JFRFT), controlled by a tunable parameter that balances the two methods. In
the domains of synthetic Cartesian product graph signals, authentic temporal
graph datasets, and dynamic image deblurring, 2D-GBFRFT consistently surpasses
2D-GFRFT and enhances JFRFT. Experimental results confirmed the versatility and
superior performance of 2D-GBFRFT for filtering in GSP.

Abstract: Superimposed pilot (SIP) schemes face significant challenges in effectively
superimposing and separating pilot and data signals, especially in multiuser
mobility scenarios with rapidly varying channels. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel channel-aware learning framework for SIP schemes, termed
CaSIP, that jointly optimizes pilot-data power (PDP) allocation and a receiver
network for pilot-data interference (PDI) elimination, by leveraging channel
path gain information, a form of large-scale channel state information (CSI).
The proposed framework identifies user-specific, resource element-wise PDP
factors and develops a deep neural network-based SIP receiver comprising
explicit channel estimation and data detection components. To properly leverage
path gain data, we devise an embedding generator that projects it into
embeddings, which are then fused with intermediate feature maps of the channel
estimation network. Simulation results demonstrate that CaSIP efficiently
outperforms traditional pilot schemes and state-of-the-art SIP schemes in terms
of sum throughput and channel estimation accuracy, particularly under
high-mobility and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

Abstract: We consider a problem faced by an intelligent roadside unit (RSU) monitoring
a roadway by a video camera. Suppose the RSU notices that a particular car in
its visual field needs to execute a specific evasive maneuver to avoid danger.
It would like to send a packet addressed to that particular car with this
suggestion. The problem is that while all the cars are communicating with the
RSU, the RSU does not know which car in the video is associated with what IP
address. So, it does not know which IP address to send the packet to. Indeed,
the problem of matching addresses with cars in the visual field is a
fundamental open problem. We provide an active solution employing dynamic
watermarking that was originally developed for the security of cyber-physical
systems. This technique calls for a car to superpose a small random excitation
onto its actuation commands for steering angle or throttle/brake positions. The
car sends this random waveform to the RSU in a packet containing its IP
address. By signal processing of the video stream of a car at the RSU it can
verify whether it matches with the waveform in the packet and thereby
associates that the IP address of the packet with that car in the visual field.
The RSU thereby determines which IP address is associated with which car in its
visual field. We present two demonstrations of performance. We demonstrate
experimental results on a laboratory transportation automated vehicles, a
vision system, and a network, as well as on the field with two passenger sedans
in practice. The results demonstrate that employing the dynamic watermarking
method enables an RSU to distinguish the communication of a target vehicle from
that of other IP addresses of nearby vehicles.

Abstract: WiFi sensing based on channel state information (CSI) collected from
commodity WiFi devices has shown great potential across a wide range of
applications, including vital sign monitoring and indoor localization. Existing
WiFi sensing approaches typically estimate motion information directly from
CSI. However, they often overlook the inherent advantages of channel impulse
response (CIR), a delay-domain representation that enables more intuitive and
principled motion sensing by naturally concentrating motion energy and
separating multipath components. Motivated by this, we revisit WiFi sensing and
introduce CIRSense, a new framework that enhances the performance and
interpretability of WiFi sensing with CIR. CIRSense is built upon a new motion
model that characterizes fractional delay effects, a fundamental challenge in
CIR-based sensing. This theoretical model underpins technical advances for the
three challenges in WiFi sensing: hardware distortion compensation,
high-resolution distance estimation, and subcarrier aggregation for extended
range sensing. CIRSense, operating with a 160 MHz channel bandwidth,
demonstrates versatile sensing capabilities through its dual-mode design,
achieving a mean error of approximately 0.25 bpm in respiration monitoring and
0.09 m in distance estimation. Comprehensive evaluations across residential
spaces, far-range scenarios, and multi-target settings demonstrate CIRSense's
superior performance over state-of-the-art CSI-based baselines. Notably, at a
challenging sensing distance of 20 m, CIRSense achieves at least 3x higher
average accuracy with more than 4.5x higher computational efficiency.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文分析了FIR滤波器在均匀分布量化噪声下的输出响应，指出输出不确定性不能假设为高斯分布，但高斯估计在某些应用中仍可能有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号处理中常假设数据符合高斯分布，但FIR滤波器等线性操作会产生加权和，使随机变量分布不再相同。本文研究FIR滤波器在均匀分布量化噪声下的输出响应特性。

Method: 通过理论分析表达FIR输出不确定性，并将其与输入量化不确定性和滤波器系数关联。通过详细数值模拟验证输出不确定性分布可通过其主导系数进行估计。

Conclusion: FIR滤波器输出噪声不能简单假设为高斯分布，但高斯近似在某些情况下仍具实用性。输出不确定性分布可通过滤波器主导系数进行有效估计。

Abstract: A common assumption in signal processing is that underlying data numerically
conforms to a Gaussian distribution. It is commonly utilized in signal
processing to describe unknown additive noise in a system and is often
justified by citing the central limit theorem for sums of random variables,
although the central limit theorem applies only to sums of independent
identically distributed random variables. However, many linear operations in
signal processing take the form of weighted sums, which transforms the random
variables such that their distributions are no longer identical. One such
operation is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. FIR filters are commonly
used in signal processing applications as a pre-processing step. FIR output
noise is generally assumed to be Gaussian. This article examines the FIR output
response in the presence of uniformly distributed quantization noise. We
express the FIR output uncertainty in terms of the input quantization
uncertainty and filter coefficients. We show that the output uncertainty cannot
be assumed to be Gaussian, but depending on the application a Gaussian
estimation may still be useful. Then, we show through detailed numerical
simulations that the output uncertainty distribution of the filter can be
estimated through its most dominant coefficients.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of position and attitude perturbations on
the beamforming performance of multi-satellite systems. The system under
analysis is a formation of small satellites equipped with direct radiating

performance is highly sensitive to the considered perturbations. However, by
incorporating position and attitude information into the beamforming process,
nominal performance can be effectively restored. These findings support the
development of control-aware beamforming strategies that tightly integrate the
attitude and orbit control system with signal processing to enable robust
beamforming and autonomous coordination.

Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is essential for both high-rate communication and
high-precision sensing in 6G wireless systems. However, a major performance
limitation arises from calibration mismatches when operating phased-array
antennas under real-world conditions. To address this issue, we propose to
integrate antenna element self-calibration into a variational sparse Bayesian
learning (VSBL) algorithm for parametric channel estimation. We model antenna
gain and phase deviations as latent variables and derive explicit update
equations to jointly infer these calibration parameters and the channel
parameters: the model order, complex amplitudes, delays, angles, and the noise
variance. The resulting algorithm operates online and adapts in real time to
hardware-induced mismatches. We assess its performance in terms of the root
mean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric,
demonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without
calibration. Our results demonstrate that embedding self-calibration within
Bayesian inference significantly enhances the robustness of channel estimation.

Abstract: The ever-growing demand for ultra-high data rates, massive connectivity, and
joint communication-sensing capabilities in future wireless networks is driving
research into sub-terahertz (sub-THz) communications. While these frequency
bands offer abundant spectrum, they also pose severe propagation and hardware
design challenges, motivating the search for alternative antenna solutions
beyond conventional antenna arrays. Leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) have emerged as
a promising candidate for sub-THz systems due to their simple feed structure,
low fabrication cost, and inherent angle-frequency coupling, which enables
frequency-controlled beamsteering with simple hardware. In this article, we
review the fundamentals of the LWA technology, highlight their unique
properties, and showcase their potential in multi-user wideband sub-THz
wireless communications. We present representative studies demonstrating that
LWAs can simultaneously support high-rate multi-user communications and
accurate localization using only a single antenna element. Finally, several key
open challenges are outlined, spanning algorithm design, signal processing,
information theory, standardization, and hardware implementation, that need to
be addressed to fully harness LWAs as a cost-effective and scalable enabler of
next generations of wireless systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G系统的快速部署，由大气波导效应引起的远程干扰已成为一个关键挑战，这种干扰会严重破坏本地基站的上行链路接收。

Method: 通过识别远程干扰的到达角估计，设计预编码器和组合器，采用零预编码和分数规划等干扰消除技术来缓解干扰。

Result: 在之前因远程干扰而无法使用的低上行发射功率条件下，实现了信道估计的归一化均方误差降低5.23dB，数据速率达到约5.8bit/s/Hz。

Conclusion: 所提出的方案能够有效缓解5G系统中的远程干扰问题，使上行链路通信在低发射功率条件下成为可能，显著提升了网络性能。

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of 5G systems, remote interference (RI) caused by
atmospheric ducting has emerged as an occasional, but critical challenge. This
phenomenon occurs when the downlink (DL) signals from distant base stations
(BSs) propagate over long distances through tropospheric ducting, severely
disrupting uplink (UL) reception at local BSs. To address this challenge, we
analyze the effect of RI on network performance, including the channel
estimation phase. We then develop a solution that identifies the
angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation of RI and designs precoders and combiners
that mitigate RI. Our approach employs interference cancellation techniques
through null precoding and fractional programming which enhance the performance
of the network. Interestingly, we show that using our scheme, uplink
communication is possible at low transmit power regimes that were unusable due
to RI. Our results further show a 5.23~dB reduction in normalized mean square
error for channel estimation and achieved data rates around 5.8~bit/s/Hz at the
previously unusable low uplink transmit power conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully automated, data-driven framework for the
large-scale deployment of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in
cellular networks. Leveraging physically consistent ray tracing and empirical
data from a commercial deployment in the UK, the proposed method jointly
optimizes RIS placement, orientation, configuration, and base station
beamforming in dense urban environments across frequency bands (corresponding
to 4G, 5G, and a hypothetical 6G system). Candidate RIS locations are
identified via reflection- and scattering-based heuristics using calibrated
electromagnetic models within the Sionna Ray Tracing (RT) engine. Outage users
are clustered to reduce deployment complexity, and the tradeoff between
coverage gains and infrastructure cost is systematically evaluated. It is shown
that achieving meaningful coverage improvement in urban areas requires a dense
deployment of large-aperture RIS units, raising questions about
cost-effectiveness. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, the
complete simulation framework and RIS deployment algorithms are provided as
open-source software.

Abstract: Since being proposed in 2006, differential privacy has become a standard
method for quantifying certain risks in publishing or sharing analyses of
sensitive data. At its heart, differential privacy measures risk in terms of
the differences between probability distributions, which is a central topic in
information theory. A differentially private algorithm is a channel between the
underlying data and the output of the analysis. Seen in this way, the
guarantees made by differential privacy can be understood in terms of
properties of this channel. In this article we examine a few of the key
connections between information theory and the formulation/application of
differential privacy, giving an ``operational significance'' for relevant
information measures.

Abstract: In this article, we explore the use of universal Gr\"obner bases in
public-key cryptography by proposing a key establishment protocol that is
resistant to quantum attacks. By utilizing a universal Gr\"obner basis
$\mathcal{U}_I$ of a polynomial ideal $I$ as a private key, this protocol
leverages the computational disparity between generating the universal
Gr\"obner basis needed for decryption compared with the single Gr\"obner basis
used for encryption. The security of the system lies in the difficulty of
directly computing the Gr\"obner fan of $I$ required to construct
$\mathcal{U}_I$. We provide an analysis of the security of the protocol and the
complexity of its various parameters. Additionally, we provide efficient ways
to recursively generate $\mathcal{U}_I$ for toric ideals of graphs with
techniques which are also of independent interest to the study of these ideals.

Abstract: A distributed quantum storage code maps a quantum message to N storage nodes,
of arbitrary specified sizes, such that the stored message is robust to an
arbitrary specified set of erasure patterns. The sizes of the storage nodes,
and erasure patterns may not be homogeneous. The capacity of distributed
quantum storage is the maximum feasible size of the quantum message (relative
to the sizes of the storage nodes), when the scaling of the size of the message
and all storage nodes by the same scaling factor is allowed. Representing the
decoding sets as hyperedges in a storage graph, the capacity is characterized
for various graphs, including MDS graph, wheel graph, Fano graph, and
intersection graph. The achievability is related via quantum CSS codes to a
classical secure storage problem. Remarkably, our coding schemes utilize
non-trivial alignment structures to ensure recovery and security in the
corresponding classical secure storage problem, which leads to similarly
non-trivial quantum codes. The converse is based on quantum information
inequalities, e.g., strong sub-additivity and weak monotonicity of quantum
entropy, tailored to the topology of the storage graphs.

Motivation: 在离散调制格式中，Bob拥有软信息而Alice只有硬信息，这迫使Alice依赖硬判决解码来恢复Bob的密钥，限制了性能。

Method: Bob向Alice披露精心设计的软度量，使用二进制LDPC码和置信传播解码在编码层面实现该方案。

Result: 所提方法可实现密钥率接近理论上界，相比硬判决反向协调有显著增益，并通过数值仿真验证了误码率性能。

Conclusion: 该软度量反向协调技术能有效提升连续变量量子密钥分发系统的性能，缩小了与理论上界的差距。

Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum key distribution, information reconciliation
is required to extract a shared secret key from correlated random variables
obtained through the quantum channel. Reverse reconciliation (RR) is generally
preferred, since the eavesdropper has less information about Bob's measurements
than about Alice's transmitted symbols. When discrete modulation formats are
employed, however, soft information is available only at Bob's side, while
Alice has access only to hard information (her transmitted sequence). This
forces her to rely on hard-decision decoding to recover Bob's key.
  In this work, we introduce a novel RR technique for PAM (and QAM) in which
Bob discloses a carefully designed soft metric to help Alice recover Bob's key,
while leaking no additional information about the key to an eavesdropper. We
assess the performance of the proposed technique in terms of achievable secret
key rate (SKR) and its bounds, showing that the achievable SKR closely
approaches the upper bound, with a significant gain over hard-decision RR.
Finally, we implement the scheme at the coded level using binary LDPC codes
with belief-propagation decoding, assess its bit-error rate through numerical
simulations, compare the observed gain with theoretical predictions from the
achievable SKR, and discuss the residual gap.

Abstract: This paper presents a cost-effective and easily-deployable flexible-sector
six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) architecture for future wireless
communication networks, which enables flexible antenna configurations to match
users' spatial distribution for capacity enhancement. Different from
conventional sectorized base station (BS) with fixed-position antennas (FPAs),
the flexible-sector 6DMA-enabled BS employs multiple directional sector antenna
arrays that can flexibly move along a common circular track. By properly moving
antennas across sectors and rotating all sector antenna arrays synchronously,
the flexible-sector BS can adjust the coverage regions of all sectors with
flexible antenna allocations over them. In particular, we consider the
multiuser downlink communication employing the orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
to serve users in each sector. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the sector
rotation and the antenna allocation at the flexible-sector BS to maximize the
average common throughput achievable for all users based on their spatial
distribution. We solve this non-convex optimization problem by deriving
closed-form solutions and thereby analyze the effect of users' spatial
distribution on the achievable common throughput. It is shown that equal user
distribution over sectors is optimal for maximizing the common throughput.
Motivated by this result, we further develop a low-complexity suboptimal
solution for the sector rotation that minimizes the variance of user numbers
across sectors. Finally, we provide simulation results to verify our analytical
results and validate the performance of our proposed solutions. It is
demonstrated that the flexible-sector BS significantly improves the network
throughput as compared to other benchmark schemes.

Abstract: The application of deep learning to the area of communications systems has
been a growing field of interest in recent years. Forward-forward (FF) learning
is an efficient alternative to the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the
typically used training procedure for neural networks. Among its several
advantages, FF learning does not require the communication channel to be
differentiable and does not rely on the global availability of partial
derivatives, allowing for an energy-efficient implementation. In this work, we
design end-to-end learned autoencoders using the FF algorithm and numerically
evaluate their performance for the additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh
block fading channels. We demonstrate their competitiveness with BP-trained
systems in the case of joint coding and modulation, and in a scenario where a
fixed, non-differentiable modulation stage is applied. Moreover, we provide
further insights into the design principles of the FF network, its training
convergence behavior, and significant memory and processing time savings
compared to BP-based approaches.

Method: 引入新的RO-QPSK（重复偏移QPSK）调制方案，分析其基本特性，并与5G中的pi/2-BPSK+FDSS方案进行比较。

Result: RO-QPSK自然产生汉宁窗形频谱，PAPR极低（约2dB），在窄带和中等频率选择性信道中，通过单抽头均衡和符号组合可提高SINR。

Conclusion: RO-QPSK是卫星通信中DFT-s-OFDM系统的有效调制方案，可结合适度FDSS进一步降低PAPR，同时保持相似性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the convergence of terrestrial cellular networks with satellite
networks, we consider an adaptation of offset quadrature phase shift keying
(OQPSK), used with single-carrier waveform in traditional satellite systems, to
discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexed (OFDM) waveform employed in the uplink of terrestrial systems. We
introduce a new order-one constellation modulation, termed repeated-and-offset
QPSK (RO-QPSK), derive its basic properties, and compare it with pi/2-BPSK with
frequency-domain spectral shaping (FDSS), as supported in 5G. RO-QPSK naturally
produces a Hann-window-shaped spectrum, resulting in a very low maximum
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) on the order of 2 dB. Moreover, with
single-tap equalization and symbol combining at the receiver, RO-QSPK can
improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) compared to pi/2-BPSK with
FDSS, in narrowband and/or moderately frequency-selective channels, as
encountered in satellite communications. A moderate FDSS can also be combined
with RO-QSPK to further reduce the PAPR while providing similar performance. Of
independent interest, general SINR expressions for DFT-s-OFDM are also
provided.

Result: 该算法能解码到任意大的距离（对应较小的速率），在所有解码距离超过中等阈值时比现有算法具有更好的距离-速率权衡。对于某些参数，该列表解码器实际上是唯一解码器。在随机拉普拉斯和高斯错误下，算法支持比ℓ1和ℓ2最坏情况错误对应的速率更大的速率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在ℓ_p度量下为Reed-Solomon码提供了高效的列表解码解决方案，在距离-速率权衡和随机错误下的性能方面优于现有方法，并为某些参数提供了唯一解码能力。

Abstract: Reed--Solomon error-correcting codes are ubiquitous across computer science
and information theory, with applications in cryptography, computational
complexity, communication and storage systems, and more. Most works on
efficient error correction for these codes, like the celebrated
Berlekamp--Welch unique decoder and the (Guruswami--)Sudan list decoders, are
focused on measuring error in the Hamming metric, which simply counts the
number of corrupted codeword symbols. However, for some applications, other
metrics that depend on the specific values of the errors may be more
appropriate.
  This work gives a polynomial-time algorithm that list decodes (generalized)
Reed--Solomon codes over prime fields in $\ell_p$ (semi)metrics, for any $0 < p
\leq 2$. Compared to prior algorithms for the Lee ($\ell_1$) and Euclidean
($\ell_2$) metrics, ours decodes to arbitrarily large distances (for
correspondingly small rates), and has better distance-rate tradeoffs for all
decoding distances above some moderate thresholds. We also prove lower bounds
on the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ minimum distances of a certain natural
subclass of GRS codes, which establishes that our list decoder is actually a
unique decoder for many parameters of interest. Finally, we analyze our
algorithm's performance under random Laplacian and Gaussian errors, and show
that it supports even larger rates than for corresponding amounts of worst-case
error in $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ (respectively).
