To further enhance generalization ability while reducing\ntraining costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a\nnew framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable\nmatrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis\nunder sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental\ntrade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a\nhigher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound\nof pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between\nempirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error,\nwhich, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On\nthe other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop\nat the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To\naddress this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper\nbound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and\nresource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption\nconstraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B\\&B)-based method is\nproposed to obtain its globally optimal solution.

While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical\nsophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and\nheterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy\naging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age\ngap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain\nage gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's\npredicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The\nresulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with\nrecent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and\nseverity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their\nmethodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical\npopulations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces\na principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in\ngraph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks\n(GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the\nanatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong\ntheoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust\nestimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP,\nmachine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path\nforward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research\ndirections in personalized medicine."}
