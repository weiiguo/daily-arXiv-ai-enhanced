Three dithering methods are\nstudied to improve spectral purity metrics. Two novel indexing schemes are\nproposed to limit the LUT memory overhead shown to compress the LUT size by\nover four orders of magnitude with marginal performance loss. The LUT design is\ntested with an oversampled noisy sinusoidal input quantized to 3 bits and shown\nto improve its Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) by over 19 dBc with only 324\nbytes of memory while maintaining the same 3-bit fixed-point precision at the\ndigital output.

Sway metrics such as sway\nmean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range,\nand sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared.

Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent\nICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed\nmoderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman\nplots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the\nFP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP.

While Autoregressive\nCompression Models (ACMs) have markedly improved compression efficiency through\nprobabilistic prediction, current approaches remain constrained by two critical\nlimitations: suboptimal compression ratios due to insufficient fine-grained\nfeature extraction during probability modeling, and real-time processing\nbottlenecks caused by high resource consumption and low compression speeds. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Efficient Dual-path Parallel Compression\n(EDPC), a hierarchically optimized compression framework that synergistically\nenhances modeling capability and execution efficiency via coordinated dual-path\noperations. At the modeling level, we introduce the Information Flow Refinement\n(IFR) metric grounded in mutual information theory, and design a Multi-path\nByte Refinement Block (MBRB) to strengthen cross-byte dependency modeling via\nheterogeneous feature propagation. At the system level, we develop a Latent\nTransformation Engine (LTE) for compact high-dimensional feature representation\nand a Decoupled Pipeline Compression Architecture (DPCA) to eliminate\nencoding-decoding latency through pipelined parallelization. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that EDPC achieves comprehensive improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods, including a 2.7x faster compression speed, and a 3.2%\nhigher compression ratio. These advancements establish EDPC as an efficient\nsolution for real-time processing of large-scale multimedia data in\nbandwidth-constrained scenarios.

The corresponding information theoretic model for\nthe uplink (from the wireless users to the CP) is a multiaccess-relay channel\nwith primitive oblivious relays. The relays (RUs) are oblivious, as they are\nagnostic of the users codebooks, and primitive, since the fronthaul links (from\nRUs to CP) are error-free with limited capacity. This class of networks has\nbeen intensely studied in the information theoretic literature, where several\napproximated or exact (under certain conditions) capacity results have been\nderived. In particular, in the Gaussian case, the model has been analyzed for\nfixed and known channel state. This paper is motivated by the fact that, in\npractice, the channel state is a random process, and it is estimated at the\nbase station side through uplink pilot symbols sent by the users. The pilot\ndimension may take up a large portion of the channel coherence block, i.e., the\nnumber of symbols over which the channel state remains approximately constant.\nHence, sending both pilot and data symbols from the relays to the CP may\nrequire a significant overhead, especially when the fronthaul capacity is\nsmall. As a prototypical problem, we consider the ergodic achievable rate for a\ndiamond network formed by a single user and two relays where the channel state\nis known at the relays, but not known at the CP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u968f\u673a\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfc\u9891\u7b26\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5355\u7528\u6237\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u94bb\u77f3\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u904d\u5386\u53ef\u8fbe\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u662f\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfc\u9891\u7b26\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u5bfc\u9891\u7b26\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u5360\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5e72\u5757\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u524d\u4f20\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u5bfc\u9891\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u7531\u5355\u7528\u6237\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u94bb\u77f3\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7aef\u5df2\u77e5\u4f46\u5728\u4e2d\u592e\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7aef\u672a\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u904d\u5386\u53ef\u8fbe\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bfc\u9891\u7b26\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

As\nwireless systems evolve every decade, the development of accurate and\nstandardized channel models becomes increasingly important for the development,\nevaluation and performance assessment of emerging technologies. An effort to\ndevelop a standardized channel model began around 2000 through the Third\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) and the International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU) with the aim of addressing a broad range of frequencies from sub-1\nGHz to 100 GHz. Prior efforts focused heavily on sub-6 GHz bands and mmWave\nbands, and there exist some gaps in accurately modeling the 7-24 GHz frequency\nrange, a promising candidate band for 6G. To address these gaps, 3GPP approved\na Release (Rel) 19 channel modeling study. This study resulted in several\nenhancements to the channel models, including the ability to accurately model a\nSuburban Macrocell (SMa) scenario, realistic User Terminal (UT) antenna models,\nvariability in the number of clusters, variability in the number of rays per\ncluster, a framework for capturing variability in power among all\npolarizations, near field (NF) propagation, and spatial non-stationarity (SNS)\neffects, all of which may be crucial for future 6G deployments.

By leveraging large volumes of low-precision measurements, we show\nhow traditionally costly constraints, such as matrix semi-definiteness and rank\nconditions, become redundant, yielding simple overdetermined linear feasibility\nproblems. We illustrate key algorithms, theoretical guarantees via the Finite\nVolume Property, and the sample abundance singularity phenomenon, where\ncomputational complexity sharply drops.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u6bd4\u7279\u548c\u5c11\u6bd4\u7279\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b80\u5316\u4f20\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6837\u672c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u534a\u5b9a\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u79e9\u6761\u4ef6\u7b49\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8d85\u5b9a\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u5947\u5f02\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6837\u672c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
