This paper\nmodels data embedding in 3D printing using principles from error-correcting\ncodes, aiming to recover embedded information from partial or altered fragments\nof the object. Previous works embedded one-dimensional data (i.e., a vector)\ninside the object, and required almost all fragments of the object for\nsuccessful decoding. In this work, we study a problem setting in which only one\nsufficiently large fragment of the object is available for decoding. We first\nshow that for one-dimensional embedded information the problem can be easily\nsolved using existing tools. Then, we introduce novel encoding schemes for\ntwo-dimensional information (i.e., a matrix), and three-dimensional information\n(i.e., a cube) which enable the information to be decoded from any sufficiently\nlarge rectangle-shaped or cuboid-shaped fragment. Lastly, we introduce a code\nthat is also capable of correcting bit-flip errors, using techniques from\nrecently proposed codes for DNA storage. Our codes operate at non-vanishing\nrates, and involve concepts from discrepancy theory called Van der Corput sets\nand Halton-Hammersely sets in novel ways."}

A main challenge when building a digital\nUE combining is the large volume of baseband samples to handle. To mitigate\ncomputational and hardware complexity, we propose a novel two-stage digital\ncombining scheme at the UE. The first stage reduces the $N_{\\text{r}}$ received\nsignals to $N_{\\text{c}}$ streams before baseband processing, leveraging\nchannel geometry for dimension reduction and updating at the beam coherence\ntime, which is longer than the channel coherence time of the small-scale\nfading. By contrast, the second-stage combining is updated per fading\nrealization. We develop a pilot-based channel estimation framework for this\nhardware setup based on maximum likelihoodestimation in both uplink and\ndownlink.
