The core contribution is the application of a weighted entropy heuristic, based on the Belis-Guias, u framework, which assigns context- dependent utility values to each of the possible feedback types. A genetic algorithm optimization approach discovers interpret-able weight patterns that reflect strategic game dynamics. First, I demonstrate that a single, fixed vector of optimized weights achieves a remarkable 4.3565 average guesses with a maximum of 5. Building upon this, I introduce a stage-weighted heuristic with distinct utility vectors for each turn, achieving 4.3488 average guesses with a maximum of 6, approaching the theoretical optimum of 4.3403 by less than 0.2%. The method retains the computational efficiency of classical one-step-ahead heuristics while significantly improving performance through principled information valuation. A complete implementation and all optimized parameters are provided for full reproducibility."}

We formalize the trade-off between expressive richness (semiotic breadth) and interpretive stability (decipherability) using information-theoretic tools. Breadth is quantified as source entropy, and decipherability as the mutual information between messages and human interpretations. We introduce a generative complexity parameter (lambda) that governs this trade-off, as both breadth and decipherability are functions of lambda. The core trade-off is modeled as an emergent property of their distinct responses to $λ$. We define a semiotic channel, parameterized by audience and context, and posit a capacity constraint on meaning transmission, operationally defined as the maximum decipherability by optimizing lambda. This reframing shifts analysis from opaque model internals to observable textual artifacts, enabling empirical measurement of breadth and decipherability. We demonstrate the framework's utility across four key applications: (i) model profiling; (ii) optimizing prompt/context design; (iii) risk analysis based on ambiguity; and (iv) adaptive semiotic systems. We conclude that this capacity-based semiotic approach offers a rigorous, actionable toolkit for understanding, evaluating, and designing LLM-mediated communication."}

Stochastic geometry offers a rigorous framework by treating base station locations as a Poisson point process and enabling coverage characterization through spatial averaging, but its expressions often involve nested integrals and special functions that limit general applicability. Probabilistic interference models seek closed-form characterizations through moment-based approximations, yet these expressions remain tractable only for restricted parameter choices and become unwieldy when interference moments lack closed-form representations. This work introduces a hybrid approximation framework that addresses these challenges by combining Monte Carlo sampling of a small set of dominant interferers with a Laplace functional representation of the residual far-field interference. The resulting dominant-plus-tail structure provides a modular, numerically stable, and path-loss-agnostic estimator suitable for both noise-limited and interference-limited regimes. We further derive theoretical error bounds that decrease with the number of dominant interferers and validate the approach against established stochastic geometry and probabilistic modeling benchmarks."}

In this work, we propose a stabilized symbolic regression framework to derive compact, analytically interpretable expressions for block error rate prediction. Trained on realistic vehicle-to-everything simulation data, the symbolic regression framework for vehicle-to-everything model accurately captures nonlinear dependencies on key system parameters, including signal-to-noise ratio, relative velocity, modulation and coding schemes, number of demodulation reference signal symbols, and environmental factors (line of sight/non-line of sight). Our final symbolic expression comprises only 158 nodes, enabling ultra-fast inference suitable for embedded deployment. On the test set, the symbolic regression framework for vehicle-to-everything model achieves a coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.8684$ and mean squared error $= 2.08 \\times 10^{-2}$ in the original block error rate domain, outperforming conventional fixed-form regressions and offering comparable accuracy to neural networks while remaining fully interpretable.

Each handoff between a satellite and ground users introduces additional signaling and power consumption, which can become a significant burden as the size of the constellation continues to increase. This work focuses on the optimization of the total transmission rate in a LEO-to-user system, by jointly considering the total transmitted power, user-satellite associations, and power consumption, the latter being handled through a penalty on handoff events. We consider a system where LEO satellites serve users located in remote areas with no terrestrial connectivity, and formulate the power allocation problem as a mixed-integer concave linear program (MICP) subject to power and association constraints. Our approach can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers and is benchmarked against a naive baseline where users associate to their closest visible satellite. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling the handoff frequency while maintaining high user throughput. These performance gains highlight the effectiveness of our handover-aware optimization strategy, which ensures that user rates improve significantly, by about 40%, without incurring a disproportionate rise in the handoff frequency."}

However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel \"free-lunch\" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings."}

In the special case of two backscatter devices (BDs), we derive closed-form solutions for the optimal reflection coefficients and power allocation by exploiting the structure of the SEE objective and the Pareto boundary of the feasible set. When more than two BDs are present, the problem becomes analytically intractable. To address this, we propose two efficient optimization techniques: (i) an exhaustive grid- based benchmark method, and (ii) a scalable particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we design a deep learning-based predictor using a feedforward neural network (FNN), which closely approximates the optimal solutions. Numerical results show that the inclusion of AmBC significantly improves SEE, with gains up to 615% compared to conventional NOMA in high-noise regimes. Additionally, the FNN model achieves more than 95% accuracy compared to the optimal baseline, while reducing complexity. Finally, we employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the learned model, revealing that the most influential features correspond to the dominant composite channel components, in accordance with the theoretical system model.

To improve the robustness of inter-vehicle data sharing, semantic communication has recently further been integrated into collaborative perception systems to enhance overall performance. However, practical deployment of such systems is challenged by the heterogeneity of sensors across different connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This diversity in perceptual data complicates the design of a unified communication framework and impedes the effective fusion of shared information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-modal semantic communication (CMSC) framework to facilitate effective collaboration among CAVs with disparate sensor configurations. Specifically, the framework first transforms heterogeneous perceptual features from different sensor modalities into a unified and standardized semantic space. Subsequently, encoding, transmission, and decoding are performed within this semantic space, enabling seamless and effective information fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMSC achieves significantly stronger perception performance than existing methods, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes."}

This paper addresses hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) against relay and user collusion in homogeneous networks, where each user connects to $n$ relays and each relay serves $m$ users. In the two-phase communication framework, users transmit masked data to relays, which then process and forward compiled messages to the server for exact sum recovery. The primary objective is to devise a transmission scheme such that the server can finish the aggregation task, while any group of $T_h$ colluding relays and $T_u$ colluding users cannot reveal any information about the data owned by the non-colluding users. In this study, we establish fundamental limits on the communication load, defined as the ratio of transmitted information size to original data size, for each user-relay link and each relay-server link. Achievable thresholds for collusion resilience are also derived. When the number of colluding relays and users falls below certain critical thresholds, we construct communication-optimal schemes using methods from network function computation. A limitation of these schemes is their reliance on large random keys. To address this, we derive a lower bound on the required key size and prove its achievability in cyclic networks, where users are connected to relays in a cyclic wrap-around manner. By establishing a connection between HSA and network function computation, this work advances the theoretical limits of communication efficiency and information-theoretic security in secure aggregation."}

Although fundamental differences between radar and optical sensors lead to differences in the reliability of predicting accurate and consistent category labels, a review of common radar perception tasks in automotive reveals that determining whether an object is moving or static is a prerequisite for most tasks. To fill this gap, this study proposes a neural network based solution that can simultaneously segment static and moving objects from radar point clouds. Furthermore, since the measured radial velocity of static objects is correlated with the motion of the radar, this approach can also estimate the instantaneous 2D velocity of the moving platform or vehicle (ego motion). However, despite performing dual tasks, the proposed method employs very simple yet effective building blocks for feature extraction: multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In addition to being the first of its kind in the literature, the proposed method also demonstrates the feasibility of extracting the information required for the dual task directly from unprocessed point clouds, without the need for cloud aggregation, Doppler compensation, motion compensation, or any other intermediate signal processing steps. To measure its performance, this study introduces a set of novel evaluation metrics and tests the proposed method using a challenging real world radar dataset, RadarScenes. The results show that the proposed method not only performs well on the dual tasks, but also has broad application potential in other radar perception tasks."}

This paper proposes and evaluates two CSI prediction frameworks applicable to both time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. The proposed methods operate in the effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) domain to reduce complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis is conducted between a classical Wiener filter and state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks based on gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and a delayed deep neural network (DNN). The evaluation considers the accuracy of the prediction in terms of mean squared error (MSE), the performance of the system, and the complexity of the implementation regarding floating point operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of both approaches under various propagation conditions. The simulation results show that the Wiener filter performs close to GRU in terms of MSE and throughput with lower computational complexity, provided that the second-order statistics of the channel are available. However, the GRU model exhibits enhanced generalization across different channel scenarios. These findings suggest that while learningbased solutions are well-suited for TDD systems where the base station (BS) handles the computation, the lower complexity of classical methods makes them a preferable choice for FDD setups, where prediction occurs at the power-constrained user equipment (UE)."}

With the objective to maximize a worst-case constellation distance, we develop two bit-partitioning methods. In uniform bit-partitioning, bits are evenly distributed across groups and modulation is designed via a max-min optimization, which is handled by a CCCP that solves a sequence of second-order cone programming subproblems. In importance-adaptive bit-partitioning (IABP), the bit allocation is adapted to the significance of individual bit positions, and the modulation and partitioning are jointly optimized. To keep the overall complexity manageable, simulated annealing is employed in the outer loop to update the partitioning, while a CCCP-based solver is used in the inner loop for modulation design. Numerical results show that both methods provide robust computation in noisy channels, and IABP achieves up to a 5 dB reduction in computation error compared to Sequential Modulation for AirComp, especially for product computation."}

This paper introduces a unified framework for generalized block signal transmission in LPWANs, addressing the limitations of conventional symbol-by-symbol approaches. The framework comprises three key components: the signal block vector, the intra-block structure generator, and the signal basis matrix, and leverages quasi-orthogonal codewords formed through cyclically shifted spreading sequences. The resulting quasi-orthogonality enables reliable multi-user separation, particularly under asynchronous access. The framework establishes a conceptual foundation for block synchronization and provides a unified demodulation structure based on block correlation matching. It further supports flexible and systematic implementation, as demonstrated through applications to frequency-shift keying and chirp spread spectrum. This work advances scalable and efficient physical-layer design for next-generation LPWANs."}

Specifically, an optimal continuous ISAC waveform is designed to form a directive beampattern for multi-target sensing while suppressing the multi-user interference (MUI). To achieve the goal of optimal waveform design, the directional beampattern of CAPA is first derived based on Green's function, whereafter a reference sensing waveform is obtained through wavenumber-domain optimization. Based on the reference sensing waveform, a weighted functional programming on the tradeoff between sensing beampattern mismatch and MUI is formulated. To solve the resulting problem, an optimal CAPA-ISAC waveform structure is analytically derived using a Lagrangian-transformation and calculus-of-variations method, where the Lagrangian multiplier associated with the optimal waveform structure is determined via Bisection search. The obtained optimal waveform reveals that it is concurrently affected by the reference sensing waveform, the channel correlations and the channel-symbol correlations. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system and waveform design, demonstrating that CAPA can achieve significant performance gains against the ISAC designs based on conventional spatially discrete array in both sensing accuracy and communication reliability."}

A suitable representer theorem allows us to transform the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one, which we then approximate with a low-dimensional surrogate. We solve the resulting optimization problem using a forward- backward splitting (FBS)-based algorithm. By exploiting the problem's modulation structure, we achieve a computational complexity per iteration that is quasi-linear in the number of unknown variables. We also propose a data-driven deep-unfolding based extension to improve the performance at a reduced number of iterations. We evaluate our channel estimators on ray-traced channels generated with SionnaRT.

The tight integration of sensing and communication introduces unique security vulnerabilities that extend beyond conventional physical-layer security (PLS). In particular, high-power transmissions directed at sensing targets may empower adversarial eavesdroppers, whereas passive interception of ISAC echoes can reveal sensitive information such as target locations and mobility patterns. This article presents an overview of recent advances in MIMO ISAC transceiver design, considering transmitter perspectives, receiver architectures, and full-duplex implementations. We examine MIMO transceiver designs under unique security threats specific to ISAC and highlight emerging countermeasures, including secure signaling design, interference exploitation, and transceiver optimization under adversarial conditions.

A final optimization on the resulting inlier set estimates the user's position and clock bias. Simulations validate that by effectively turning NLOS paths into valuable geometric information via the DT, the approach enables accurate localization, reduces reliance on direct LOS, and significantly lowers system deployment costs, making it suitable for practical deployment."}

Most conventional beamforming methods, whether implemented in the time or frequency domains, suffer from limited axial resolution due to the absence of a reference emission onset time. While frequency-domain methods, the most efficient of which are based on the cross-spectral matrix, require long signals for accurate estimation, time-domain methods typically achieve lower spatial resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a linear model-based beamforming framework fully formulated in the time domain. The linear forward model relates a discretized spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation activity to the temporal signals recorded by a probe, explicitly accounting for time-of-flight delays dictated by the acquisition geometry. This model is then inverted using regularization techniques that exploit prior knowledge of cavitation activity in both spatial and temporal domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves enhanced or competitive cavitation map quality while using only 20\\% of the data typically required by frequency-domain methods. This highlights the substantial gain in data efficiency and the flexibility of our spatiotemporal regularization to adapt to diverse passive cavitation scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques."}

While line-of-sight (LOS) links are typically expected to dominate in NF scenarios, the impact of non-LOS (NLOS) components at both in centimeter- and millimeter-wave frequencies may be in general non-negligible. Moreover, although weaker than the LOS path, NLOS links may be essential for achieving multiplexing gains in MIMO systems. The commonly used NF channel models for NLOS links in the literature are based on the point scattering assumption, which is not valid for large reflectors such as walls, ceilings, and the ground. In this paper, we develop a generalized statistical NF MIMO channel model that extends the widely adopted point scattering framework to account for imperfect reflections from large surfaces. This model is then leveraged to investigate how the physical characteristics of these reflectors influence the resulting NF MIMO channel. In addition, using the proposed channel model, we analytically demonstrate for a multi-user scenario that, even when users are located within the NF regime, relying solely on LOS NF links may be insufficient to achieve multiplexing gains, thus exploiting NLOS links becomes essential. Our simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed model and show that, in many practical settings, the contribution of NLOS components is non-negligible and must be carefully accounted for in the system design."}

Stochastic geometry offers a rigorous framework by treating base station locations as a Poisson point process and enabling coverage characterization through spatial averaging, but its expressions often involve nested integrals and special functions that limit general applicability. Probabilistic interference models seek closed-form characterizations through moment-based approximations, yet these expressions remain tractable only for restricted parameter choices and become unwieldy when interference moments lack closed-form representations. This work introduces a hybrid approximation framework that addresses these challenges by combining Monte Carlo sampling of a small set of dominant interferers with a Laplace functional representation of the residual far-field interference. The resulting dominant-plus-tail structure provides a modular, numerically stable, and path-loss-agnostic estimator suitable for both noise-limited and interference-limited regimes. We further derive theoretical error bounds that decrease with the number of dominant interferers and validate the approach against established stochastic geometry and probabilistic modeling benchmarks."}

Each handoff between a satellite and ground users introduces additional signaling and power consumption, which can become a significant burden as the size of the constellation continues to increase. This work focuses on the optimization of the total transmission rate in a LEO-to-user system, by jointly considering the total transmitted power, user-satellite associations, and power consumption, the latter being handled through a penalty on handoff events. We consider a system where LEO satellites serve users located in remote areas with no terrestrial connectivity, and formulate the power allocation problem as a mixed-integer concave linear program (MICP) subject to power and association constraints. Our approach can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers and is benchmarked against a naive baseline where users associate to their closest visible satellite. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling the handoff frequency while maintaining high user throughput. These performance gains highlight the effectiveness of our handover-aware optimization strategy, which ensures that user rates improve significantly, by about 40%, without incurring a disproportionate rise in the handoff frequency."}

However, challenges such as channel aging, user mobility, and feedback delays significantly impact the performance of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). This paper proposes and evaluates two CSI prediction frameworks applicable to both time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. The proposed methods operate in the effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) domain to reduce complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis is conducted between a classical Wiener filter and state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks based on gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and a delayed deep neural network (DNN). The evaluation considers the accuracy of the prediction in terms of mean squared error (MSE), the performance of the system, and the complexity of the implementation regarding floating point operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of both approaches under various propagation conditions. The simulation results show that the Wiener filter performs close to GRU in terms of MSE and throughput with lower computational complexity, provided that the second-order statistics of the channel are available. However, the GRU model exhibits enhanced generalization across different channel scenarios. These findings suggest that while learningbased solutions are well-suited for TDD systems where the base station (BS) handles the computation, the lower complexity of classical methods makes them a preferable choice for FDD setups, where prediction occurs at the power-constrained user equipment (UE)."}
