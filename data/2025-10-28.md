### [1] [Fundamental Limits of Coded Caching with Fixed Subpacketization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22145)
*Minquan Cheng,Yifei Huang,Youlong Wu,Jinyan Wang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了编码缓存系统中传输负载与子分组化级别之间的基本权衡关系，提出了针对任意固定子分组化级别的传输负载下界，并证明了分区方案能够达到最优的速率-子分组化权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编码缓存技术通过将文件分割成多个数据包并让用户缓存部分数据包，可以显著降低传输负载。虽然更高的子分组化级别可能带来更低的传输负载，但过大的子分组化级别会导致编码复杂度增加。现有研究缺乏对给定子分组化级别下最小传输负载的理论分析。

Method: 通过重新表述集中式编码缓存方案对应的放置交付阵列的组合结构，提出了针对任意固定子分组化级别的传输负载通用下界。利用组合结构和计算排序集合的并集大小，建立了新的最优性结果。

Result: 提出的下界恢复了现有最优性结果（包括MN方案及其共轭方案），并证明了分区方案能够达到最优的速率-子分组化权衡。

Conclusion: 本文建立了编码缓存系统中传输负载与子分组化级别之间的基本权衡关系，为设计低复杂度高性能的编码缓存方案提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Coded caching is a promising technique to create coded multicast
opportunities for cache-aided networks. By splitting each file into $F$ equal
packets (i.e., the subpacketization level $F$) and letting each user cache a
set of packets, the transmission load can be significantly reduced via coded
multicasting. It has been shown that a higher subpacketization level could
potentially lead to a lower transmission load, as more packets can be combined
for efficient transmission. On the other hand, a larger $F$ indicates a higher
coding complexity and is problematic from a practical perspective when $F$ is
extremely large. Despite many works attempting to design coded caching schemes
with low subpacketization levels, a fundamental problem remains open: What is
the minimum transmission load given any fixed subpacketization level? In this
paper, we consider the classical cache-aided networks with identically uncoded
placement and one-shot delivery strategy, and investigate the fundamental
trade-off between the transmission load and the subpacketization level. We
propose a \emph{general} lower bound on the transmission load for any fixed
subpacketization by reformulating the centralized coded caching schemes via the
combinatorial structure of the corresponding placement delivery array. The
lower bound also recovers existing optimality results for the bipartite graph
scheme (including the well-known Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) scheme and the
conjugate MN scheme) as well as the grouping bipartite graph scheme.
Furthermore, by carefully exploiting the combinatorial structure and computing
the union size of sorted sets, we establish a new optimality result, i.e., the
partition scheme can achieve the optimal rate-subpacketization trade-off.

### [2] [Robust MIMO Channel Estimation Using Energy-Based Generative Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22230)
*Ziqi Diao,Xingyu Zhou,Le Liang,Shi Jin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于能量生成扩散模型和Metropolis-Hastings原理的新型信道估计框架，显著提升了大规模MIMO系统的信道估计精度，特别是在导频开销有限的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MIMO系统的信道估计面临导频开销过大和估计延迟高的根本性限制，需要克服这些障碍。

Method: 将能量生成扩散模型与Metropolis-Hastings原理相结合，通过重新参数化扩散过程包含能量函数来显式估计未归一化的对数先验，同时使用MH校正来优化采样轨迹、减轻偏差并增强鲁棒性。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法相比传统参数化扩散模型和其他基线方法显著提高了估计精度，特别是在导频开销有限的情况下。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现准确的后验采样，从而获得高保真度的信道估计，为大规模MIMO系统提供了有效的信道估计解决方案。

Abstract: Channel estimation for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
is fundamentally constrained by excessive pilot overhead and high estimation
latency. To overcome these obstacles, recent studies have leveraged deep
generative networks to capture the prior distribution of wireless channels. In
this paper, we propose a novel estimation framework that integrates an
energy-based generative diffusion model (DM) with the Metropolis-Hastings (MH)
principle. By reparameterizing the diffusion process with an incorporated
energy function, the framework explicitly estimates the unnormalized log-prior,
while MH corrections refine the sampling trajectory, mitigate deviations, and
enhance robustness, ultimately enabling accurate posterior sampling for
high-fidelity channel estimation. Numerical results reveal that the proposed
approach significantly improves estimation accuracy compared with conventional
parameterized DMs and other baseline methods, particularly in cases with
limited pilot overhead.

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Hamming在1950年提出的关于球填充界距离最优线性码无限族存在的75年开放问题。

Conclusion: 彻底解决了这个75年悬而未决的编码理论基本问题，为编码理论的发展提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: R. W. Hamming published the Hamming codes and the sphere packing bound in
1950. In the past 75 years, infinite families of distance-optimal linear codes
over finite fields with minimum distance at most 8 with respect to the sphere
packing bound have been reported in the literature. However, it is a
75-year-old open problem in coding theory whether there is an infinite family
of distance-optimal linear codes over finite fields with arbitrarily large
minimum distance with respect to the sphere packing bound. This main objective
of this paper is to settle this long-standing open problem in coding theory.
  As by-products, several infinite families of distance-optimal binary codes
with small minimum distances are presented. Two infinite families of binary
five-weight codes are reported. Some open problems are also proposed.

### [4] [Optimal Sampling and Scheduling for Remote Fusion Estimation of Correlated Wiener Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22288)
*Aimin Li,Elif Uysal*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了分布式传感器网络中异步相关信息的融合估计问题，提出了采样、调度和估计策略的联合优化方法，证明了AoI优化与MSE优化的等价性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式传感器网络中，传感器观测相关动态过程但数据异步到达融合中心，如何融合这些异步且相关的信息进行准确估计是一个核心挑战。

Method: 建立了分离原则，识别出联合最优策略：基于AoI的加权和融合估计器、最大年龄优先调度器，以及给定最优估计器和MAF调度器的最优采样设计。

Result: 证明了在无限时域平均成本准则下，AoI优化等价于MSE优化，即使存在强传感器间相关性。MSE最优采样器就是AoI最优采样器。

Conclusion: 信息新鲜度可以作为相关感知环境中最优估计的设计替代指标，这一发现为分布式传感器网络的异步信息融合提供了重要洞察。

Abstract: In distributed sensor networks, sensors often observe a dynamic process
within overlapping regions. Due to random delays, these correlated observations
arrive at the fusion center asynchronously, raising a central question: How can
one fuse asynchronous yet correlated information for accurate remote fusion
estimation? This paper addresses this challenge by studying the joint design of
sampling, scheduling, and estimation policies for monitoring a correlated
Wiener process. Though this problem is coupled, we establish a separation
principle and identify the joint optimal policy: the optimal fusion estimator
is a weighted-sum fusion estimator conditioned on Age of Information (AoI), the
optimal scheduler is a Maximum Age First (MAF) scheduler that prioritizes the
most stale source, and the optimal sampling can be designed given the optimal
estimator and the MAF scheduler. To design the optimal sampling, we show that,
under the infinite-horizon average-cost criterion, optimizing AoI is equivalent
to optimizing MSE under pull-based communications, despite the presence of
strong inter-sensor correlations. This structural equivalence allows us to
identify the MSE-optimal sampler as one that is AoI-optimal. This result
underscores an insight: information freshness can serve as a design surrogate
for optimal estimation in correlated sensing environments.

### [5] [Energy-Efficient UAV-Enabled MEC Systems: NOMA, FDMA, or TDMA Offloading?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22306)
*Qingjie Wu,Miao Cui,Guangchi Zhang,Beixiong Zheng,Xiaoli Chu,Qingqing Wu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文比较了无人机移动边缘计算系统中NOMA、FDMA和TDMA三种多址接入方案在有限块长度下的能耗性能，发现TDMA在能耗方面始终优于FDMA，而NOMA在有限块长度下不一定比FDMA更节能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机移动边缘计算系统可以使用不同的多址接入方案协调多用户任务卸载，但尚不清楚哪种方案在有限块长度下最节能，因此需要比较NOMA、FDMA和TDMA方案的能耗性能。

Method: 通过理论分析三种方案的最小能耗需求，并提出一种交替优化算法，联合优化任务卸载比例、所有用户设备的卸载时间以及无人机位置。

Result: 理论分析和仿真结果表明：TDMA在无限和有限块长度情况下始终比FDMA能耗更低；NOMA在有限块长度下不一定比FDMA更节能，特别是在两个用户设备的信道条件和任务数据大小相对对称时。

Conclusion: TDMA是无人机移动边缘计算系统中最节能的多址接入方案，提出的交替优化算法能有效降低MEC相关能耗。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) systems can
use different multiple access schemes to coordinate multi-user task offloading.
However, it is still unknown which scheme is the most energy-efficient,
especially when the offloading blocklength is finite. To answer this question,
this paper minimizes and compares the MEC-related energy consumption of
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency division multiple access
(FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA)-based offloading schemes
within UAV-enabled MEC systems, considering both infinite and finite
blocklength scenarios. Through theoretically analysis of the minimum energy
consumption required by these three schemes, two novel findings are presented.
First, TDMA consistently achieves lower energy consumption than FDMA in both
infinite and finite blocklength cases, due to the degrees of freedom afforded
by sequential task offloading. Second, NOMA does not necessarily achieve lower
energy consumption than FDMA when the offloading blocklength is finite,
especially when the channel conditions and the offloaded task data sizes of two
user equipments (UEs) are relatively symmetric. Furthermore, an alternating
optimization algorithm that jointly optimizes the portions of task offloaded,
the offloading times of all UEs, and the UAV location is proposed to solve the
formulated energy consumption minimization problems. Simulation results verify
the correctness of our analytical findings and demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm effectively reduces MEC-related energy consumption compared to
benchmark schemes that do not optimize task offloading portions and/or
offloading times.

### [6] [Resource Allocation for XR with Edge Offloading: A Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22505)
*Alperen Duru,Mohammad Mozaffari,Ticao Zhang,Mehrnaz Afshang*

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来XR应用需要高能效、高数据速率和低延迟的无线通信，需要智能自适应的资源分配与边缘卸载来支持这些需求。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，根据XR头显能力和网络条件动态分配上下行时隙并做出卸载决策，进行帧丢失率与能效权衡的数值分析。

Result: 部分卸载相比始终卸载或从不卸载，可将覆盖范围扩展55%，能耗降低高达34%。头显本地计算能力对卸载决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 头显本地计算能力越高，本地处理越高效，减少卸载需求，提升节能效果。部分卸载策略能有效优化XR应用性能。

Abstract: Future immersive XR applications will require energy-efficient, high data
rate, and low-latency wireless communications in uplink and downlink. One of
the key considerations for supporting such XR applications is intelligent and
adaptive resource allocation with edge offloading. To address these demands,
this paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based resource allocation
framework that dynamically allocates uplink and downlink slots while making
offloading decisions based on the XR headset's capabilities and network
conditions. The paper presents a numerical analysis of the tradeoff between
frame loss rate (FLR) and energy efficiency, identifying decision regions for
partial offloading to optimize performance. Results show that for the used set
of system parameters, partial offloading can extend the coverage area by 55%
and reduce energy consumption by up to 34%, compared to always or never
offloading. The results demonstrate that the headset's local computing
capability plays a crucial role in offloading decisions. Higher computing
abilities enable more efficient local processing, reduce the need for
offloading, and enhance energy savings.

### [7] [End-to-end Learning of Probabilistic and Geometric Constellation Shaping with Iterative Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22608)
*Harindu Jayarathne,Dileepa Marasinghe,Nandana Rajatheva,Matti Latva-aho*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的星座成形学习方法，通过成形编码器辅助的收发器架构，联合优化符号概率分布和星座几何形状，在迭代接收器下相比标准APSK和QAM获得0.1-0.3 dB的BER性能增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星座调制如APSK和QAM在概率分布和几何形状上存在优化空间，通过端到端学习可以更有效地设计星座，提升通信系统性能。

Method: 使用成形编码器产生零概率较高的成形比特，建立高效的符号概率分布；采用端到端学习联合优化概率分布和星座几何；扩展方法包含完整迭代检测解码循环，使用深度展开技术。

Result: 在两种迭代接收器架构下，学习得到的星座相比标准APSK和QAM分别获得最大0.3 dB和0.15 dB的BER增益；在块衰落信道条件下，迭代方案相比标准APSK获得0.1 dB的BER增益。

Conclusion: 端到端学习方法能够有效优化星座成形，在迭代接收器架构下实现显著的BER性能提升，证明了该方法在通信系统设计中的有效性。

Abstract: An end-to-end learning method for constellation shaping with a
shaping-encoder assisted transceiver architecture is presented. The shaping
encoder, which produces shaping bits with a higher probability of zeros, is
used to produce an efficient symbol probability distribution. Both the
probability distribution and the constellation geometry are jointly optimized,
using end-to-end learning. Optimized constellations are evaluated using two
iterative receiver architectures. Bit error rate (BER) performance gain is
quantified against standard amplitude phase-shift keying (APSK) and quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. A maximum BER gain of 0.3 dB and
0.15 dB are observed under two receivers for the learned constellations
compared to standard APSK or QAM. The basic approach is extended to incorporate
the full iterative detection and decoding loop, using the deep unfolding
technique. A bit error rate gain of 0.1 dB is observed for the iterative scheme
with learned constellations under block fading channel conditions, when
compared to standard APSK.

*Zhou Li,Siyan Qin,Xiang Zhang,Jihao Fan,Haiqiang Chen,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了条件秘密披露(CDS)问题中的噪声容量，确定了CDS噪声容量达到最大值1的充要条件，并为任何CDS实例推导了线性噪声容量的上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在条件秘密披露问题中，Alice和Bob希望仅在输入满足特定函数关系时才向Carol揭示秘密，同时通过引入噪声防止不合格输入组合下的秘密泄露。研究目标是确定噪声容量，即能安全揭示给Carol的最大秘密比特数与Alice和Bob共同持有的独立噪声比特总数之比。

Method: 建立了CDS噪声容量达到最大值1的充要条件，并为任何CDS实例推导了线性噪声容量的上界，该上界表示为(ρ-1)(d-1)/(ρd-1)，其中ρ是函数f图表示的覆盖参数，d是位于不合格路径中的不合格边数。

Conclusion: 本文为条件秘密披露问题中的噪声容量提供了理论分析框架，明确了最优噪声容量的实现条件，并为一般情况下的性能界限提供了数学表达。

Abstract: In the problem of conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS), two parties, Alice
and Bob, each has an input and shares a common secret. Their goal is to reveal
the secret to a third party, Carol, as efficiently as possible, only if the
inputs of Alice and Bob satisfy a certain functional relation $f $. To prevent
leakage of the secret to Carol when the input combination is unqualified, both
Alice and Bob introduce noise. This work aims to determine the noise capacity,
defined as the maximum number of secret bits that can be securely revealed to
Carol, normalized by the total number of independent noise bits held jointly by
Alice and Bob. Our contributions are twofold. First, we establish the necessary
and sufficient conditions under which the CDS noise capacity attains its
maximum value of $1$. Second, in addition to the above best-case scenarios, we
derive an upper bound on the linear noise capacity for any CDS instance. In
particular, this upper bound is equal to $(\rho-1)(d-1)/(\rho d-1)$, where
$\rho$ is the covering parameter of the graph representation of $f$, and $d$ is
the number of unqualified edges in residing unqualified path.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了ECO-GS系统，通过本地小模型和远程大模型的协作切换来解决Gaussian Splatting在低成本设备上的渲染质量问题，并开发了IRAC联合优化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting在低成本设备上渲染质量下降，需要一种既能保证实时性又能保证保真度的解决方案。

Method: 提出ECO-GS系统，用户可在本地小GS模型和远程大GS模型间切换；开发IRAC联合优化算法，通过PMM和ILO算法解决协作状态和边缘功率分配的联合优化问题。

Result: PMM算法能获得临界点解，ILO算法相比PMM计算时间减少100倍以上，实现了实时执行能力。

Conclusion: ECO-GS系统有效解决了GS在低成本设备上的渲染质量问题，PMM和ILO算法在性能和效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting (GS) struggles with degraded rendering quality on low-cost
devices. To address this issue, we present edge collaborative GS (ECO-GS),
where each user can switch between a local small GS model to guarantee
timeliness and a remote large GS model to guarantee fidelity. However, deciding
how to engage the large GS model is nontrivial, due to the interdependency
between rendering requirements and resource conditions. To this end, we propose
integrated rendering and communication (IRAC), which jointly optimizes
collaboration status (i.e., deciding whether to engage large GS) and edge power
allocation (i.e., enabling remote rendering) under communication constraints
across different users by minimizing a newly-derived GS switching function.
Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose an efficient penalty
majorization minimization (PMM) algorithm to obtain the critical point
solution. Furthermore, we develop an imitation learning optimization (ILO)
algorithm, which reduces the computational time by over 100x compared to PMM.
Experiments demonstrate the superiority of PMM and the real-time execution
capability of ILO.

Method: 通过将极化码构造中合成信道的生成转换为代数运算，将合成信道表征为二进制对称信道的随机切换信道。

Result: 开发了一种表征合成信道的方法，并推导了合成信道输出字母表中具有相同似然比元素数量的下界。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估极化码中合成信道的可靠性提供了理论基础，有助于解决极化码构造中的关键问题。

Abstract: The polar codes introduced by Arikan in 2009 achieve the capacity of
binary-input discrete memoryless channels (BIDMCs) with low complexity encoding
and decoding. Identifying the unreliable synthetic channels, generated by
Arikan transformation during the construction of these polar codes, is crucial.
Currently, because of the large size of the output alphabets of synthetic
channels, there is no efficient and practical approach to evaluate their
reliability in general. To tackle this problem, by converting the generation of
synthetic channels in polar code construction into algebraic operations, in
this paper we develop a method to characterize the synthetic channels as random
switching channels of binary symmetric channels when the underlying channels
are symmetric. Moreover, a lower bound for the average number of elements that
possess the same likelihood ratio within the output alphabet of any synthetic
channel generated in polar codes is also derived.

Abstract: The information fusion field has recently been attracting a lot of interest
within the scientific community, as it provides, through the combination of
different sources of heterogeneous information, a fuller and/or more precise
understanding of the real world than can be gained considering the above
sources separately. One of the fundamental aims of computer systems, and
especially decision support systems, is to assure that the quality of the
information they process is high. There are many different approaches for this
purpose, including information fusion. Information fusion is currently one of
the most promising methods. It is particularly useful under circumstances where
quality might be compromised, for example, either intrinsically due to
imperfect information (vagueness, uncertainty) or because of limited resources
(energy, time). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has been
undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in this field
have focused on problem-specific issues and have been circumscribed to certain
system types. Therefore, there is no holistic and systematic knowledge of the
state of the art to help establish the steps to be taken in the future. In
particular, aspects like what impact different information fusion methods have
on information quality, how information quality is characterised, measured and
evaluated in different application domains depending on the problem data type
or whether fusion is designed as a flexible process capable of adapting to
changing system circumstances and their intrinsically limited resources have
not been addressed. This paper aims precisely to review the literature on
research into the use of information fusion techniques specifically to improve
information quality, analysing the above issues in order to identify a series
of challenges and research directions, which are presented in this paper.

### [12] [Pinching-antenna-enabled Federated Learning: Tail Latency, Participation, and Convergence Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23315)
*Yushen Lin,Zihan Chen,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: PASS系统通过动态调整天线结构来缩短最差链路的距离，提高联邦学习的同步和异步训练效率，减少延迟和掉队者问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线网络中联邦学习受限于不可预测的信道条件导致的掉队者延迟问题，需要从物理层根本解决。

Method: 提出pinching-antenna系统(PASS)，动态调整介质波导上的辐射器位置；结合物理层感知采样和误差反馈压缩技术。

Result: PASS提高了同步联邦学习的按时完成概率，缩短了异步联邦学习的延迟，显著减少了延迟尾部。

Conclusion: PASS通过从物理层根源解决掉队者问题，有效加速了无线联邦学习，是对高层调度的有益补充。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in wireless networks is limited by straggler delays
from unpredictable channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the
pinching-antenna system (PASS), which dynamically 'pinches' the radiator along
a dielectric waveguide to shorten the worst links. In synchronous FL (SFL), we
prove that PASS shortens the worst-link distance, and it increases the on-time
completion probability in asynchronous FL (AFL). Accordingly, SFL exhibits
stochastic dominance on round time, while AFL yields explicit latency and
participation gains. We then pair physical-layer (PHY)-aware sampling with
error-feedback compression and prove that pinching raises the minimum inclusion
probability, thus shrinking both the sampling variability and
compression-induced floors in a Lyapunov analysis. Simulations demonstrate
consistent wall clock speedups and markedly shorter latency tails. By
addressing stragglers at their PHY root, PASS complements higher-layer
scheduling and accelerates wireless FL in both SFL and AFL.

Result: 第一种构造在相同参数下实现了最小的修复带宽，且相对于Zhang等人提出的平均修复带宽下界是渐近最优的。第二种构造提供了灵活的修复策略选择。

Conclusion: 所提出的两种DRF MDS阵列码构造在小有限域上实现了优异的修复性能，为存储系统提供了高效的节点修复解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present two constructions of degraded read friendly (DRF)
MDS array codes with two parity nodes and a sub-packetization level of 2 over
small finite fields, applicable for any arbitrary code length. The first
construction achieves the smallest repair bandwidth among all existing
constructions with the same parameters, and is asymptotically optimal with
respect to the lower bound on the average repair bandwidth characterized by
Zhang et al. The second construction supports two repair mechanisms, depending
on whether computation within the helper nodes is permitted or not during the
node repair process, thereby optimizing either the repair bandwidth or the
rebuilding access.

Abstract: Objective: Tinnitus affects 10-15% of the population yet lacks objective
diagnostic biomarkers. This study applied machine learning to EEG and fMRI data
to identify neural signatures distinguishing tinnitus patients from healthy
controls. Methods: Two datasets were analyzed: 64-channel EEG recordings from
80 participants (40 tinnitus, 40 controls) and resting-state fMRI data from 38
participants (19 tinnitus, 19 controls). EEG analysis extracted microstate
features across four to seven clustering states and five frequency bands,
producing 440 features per subject. Global Field Power signals were also
transformed into wavelet images for deep learning. fMRI data were analyzed
using slice-wise convolutional neural networks and hybrid models combining
pre-trained architectures (VGG16, ResNet50) with Decision Tree, Random Forest,
and SVM classifiers. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold

Results: EEG microstate analysis revealed altered network dynamics in tinnitus,
particularly reduced gamma-band microstate B occurrence (healthy: 56.56 vs
tinnitus: 43.81, p < 0.001) and diminished alpha coverage. Tree-based

Abstract: This study focuses on the connection of a development kit that enables
real-time monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using a mobile system.
A software developed on the Visual Studio .NET platform reads real-time ECG
signals from the human body through non invasive methods and displays them
graphically on the mobile system. ECG electrodes placed on specific areas of
the body using the method known as Einthoven's triangle. Subsequently, the
software initiates data flow through the serial port, and these data displayed
as signal values on the mobile device's screen via a graphical interface. When
the monitored ECG signals fall below a certain threshold or reach a critical
value, the system provides feedback with an alert based on medical data. The
developed system is fully portable. Additionally, the implemented system has
the potential to form the basis for a multi-purpose system in the future, such
as online patient monitoring, patient location tracking, and even initial
intervention using the defibrillation method.

TL;DR: 提出AS-MMD方法解决小样本P300检测中的跨数据集迁移学习问题，结合目标加权损失、Split Batch Normalization和RBF-MMD正则化，在严格小样本条件下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单次试验P300检测中仅有少量标记样本时的困难，以及使用大源数据集增强小目标集时出现的跨数据集偏移问题

Method: 提出AS-MMD方法：1) 目标加权损失与基于源/目标大小比平方根的预热策略；2) Split Batch Normalization（共享仿射参数，各域独立运行统计）；3) 无参数logit级RBF-MMD正则化项（使用中值带宽启发式）

Result: 在两个视觉oddball ERP数据集上，AS-MMD在两种迁移方向均优于仅目标训练和池化训练（Active Visual Oddball：准确率/AUC 0.66/0.74；ERP CORE P3：0.61/0.65），经校正配对t检验证实显著优于池化方法

Conclusion: AS-MMD方法有效解决了小样本P300检测中的跨数据集迁移问题，消融实验证明三个组件均对性能提升有贡献，且方法对骨干网络不可知且不影响推理时模型

Abstract: Detecting single-trial P300 from EEG is difficult when only a few labeled
trials are available. When attempting to boost a small target set with a large
source dataset through transfer learning, cross-dataset shift arises. To
address this challenge, we study transfer between two public visual-oddball ERP
datasets using five shared electrodes (Fz, Pz, P3, P4, Oz) under a strict
small-sample regime (target: 10 trials/subject; source: 80 trials/subject). We
introduce Adaptive Split Maximum Mean Discrepancy Training (AS-MMD), which
combines (i) a target-weighted loss with warm-up tied to the square root of the
source/target size ratio, (ii) Split Batch Normalization (Split-BN) with shared
affine parameters and per-domain running statistics, and (iii) a parameter-free
logit-level Radial Basis Function kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (RBF-MMD)
term using the median-bandwidth heuristic. Implemented on an EEG Conformer,
AS-MMD is backbone-agnostic and leaves the inference-time model unchanged.
Across both transfer directions, it outperforms target-only and pooled training
(Active Visual Oddball: accuracy/AUC 0.66/0.74; ERP CORE P3: 0.61/0.65), with
gains over pooling significant under corrected paired t-tests. Ablations
attribute improvements to all three components.

Abstract: For a wide range of envisioned integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
use cases, it is necessary to incorporate tracking techniques into cellular
communication systems. While numerous multi-object tracking algorithms exist,
they have not yet been applied to real-world ISAC, with its challenges such as
clutter and non-optimal hardware. In this work, we showcase multi-object
tracking based on the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter in the range
and Doppler speed domain. The measurements are taken with a 5G compliant ISAC
proof-of-concept in a real factory environment, where the pedestrian-like
objects are generated by a radar object emulator. We detail the complete
pipeline, from measurement acquisition to evaluation, with a focus on the
post-processing of the raw captured data and the tracking itself. Our
end-to-end evaluation and comparison to simulations show good multi-object
tracking performance with mean absolute error <1.5m and detection rates >91%
for realistic but challenging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC系统采用模拟/混合波束成形结构限制了角度覆盖范围，需要基于最少角度采样实现最优角度估计和目标分离

Method: 使用DFT角度采样集，在ARENA2036工业场景中通过扫描多个波束获取样本，比较插值法和正交匹配追踪(OMP)方法

Result: 插值方法在不同角度场景中泛化性更好；OMP对单个强目标估计最准确；DFT插值方法整体性能最佳

Conclusion: DFT插值方法在ISAC系统中具有最佳的角度估计性能，适用于各种角度场景

Abstract: The introduction of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) in cellular
systems is not expected to result in a shift away from the popular choice of
cost- and energy-efficient analog or hybrid beamforming structures. However,
this comes at the cost of limiting the angular capabilities to a confined space
per acquisitions. Thus, as a prerequisite for the successful implementation of
numerous ISAC use cases, the need for an optimal angular estimation of targets
and their separation based on the minimal number of angular samples arises.
  In this work, different approaches for angular estimation based on a minimal,
DFT-based set of angular samples are evaluated. The samples are acquired
through sweeping multiple beams of an ISAC proof of concept (PoC) in the
industrial scenario of the ARENA2036. The study's findings indicate that
interpolation approaches are more effective for generalizing across different
types of angular scenarios. While the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)
approach exhibits the most accurate estimation for a single, strong and clearly
discriminable target, the DFT-based interpolation approach demonstrates the
best overall estimation performance.

Conclusion: 该小波框架为具有密集模态和非经典阻尼的机械系统提供了有效的模态识别和降阶建模解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a purely data-driven, wavelet-based framework for modal
identification and reduced-order modeling of mechanical systems with assumed
linear dynamics characterized by closely spaced modes with classical or
non-classical damping distribution. Traditional Fourier-based methods often
fail to reliably identify closely spaced modes or accurately capture modal
interactions and complexities. To address these limitations, we propose a
methodology leveraging the enhanced time -frequency resolution capabilities of
the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). By selecting appropriate harmonic
regions within the wavelet spectra, we effectively isolate modes, and then
invert them back in the temporal domain by applying the inverse CWT (ICWT). In
this way we reconstruct the corresponding modal dynamics in the time domain.
Using the Hilbert transform, instantaneous phases are extracted for each
identified mode, enabling the introduction of a complexified modal matrix which
robustly characterizes the system's modal properties, even under challenging
perturbations such as noise and uncertainties due to modal interference and
unmodeled effects. The identified modal parameters are utilized to reconstruct
the frequency response functions (FRFs) of the system and to develop a
reduced-order model (ROM) that captures accurately the system's dominant
dynamical behavior valid in a specified frequency range.. Validation of the
methodology is conducted both with a numerical non-classical damping and an
experimental testbed representing a model of an airplane structure. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in resolving intricate
modal interactions and accurately reproducing the dynamic response of complex
structural systems.

Motivation: 商用GNSS接收机在高动态条件下性能严重受限，传统跟踪环路带宽无法适应快速变化的同步参数，导致导航解算不连续。

Method: 使用遗传算法自主探索接收机配置空间，优化相位、频率和延迟跟踪的环路参数，在SDR环境中验证。

Result: 优化后的配置在三种动态场景下表现优异：静态场景位置误差约6m、速度误差0.08m/s；火箭场景12m和2.5m/s；LEO场景5m和0.2m/s。

Conclusion: 进化优化使SDR接收机能够在各种动态条件下保持稳健准确的PVT解算，解决了高动态环境下的GNSS性能问题。

Abstract: Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
receivers face significant limitations under high-dynamic conditions,
particularly in high-acceleration environments such as those experienced by
launch vehicles. These performance degradations, often observed as
discontinuities in the navigation solution, arise from the inability of
traditional tracking loop bandwidths to cope with rapid variations in
synchronization parameters. Software-Defined Radio (SDR) receivers overcome
these constraints by enabling flexible reconfiguration of tracking loops;
however, manual tuning involves a complex, multidimensional search and seldom
ensures optimal performance. This work introduces a genetic algorithm-based
optimization framework that autonomously explores the receiver configuration
space to determine optimal loop parameters for phase, frequency, and delay
tracking. The approach is validated within an SDR environment using
realistically simulated GPS L1 signals for three representative dynamic regimes
-guided rocket flight, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite, and static
receiver-processed with the open-source GNSS-SDR architecture. Results
demonstrate that evolutionary optimization enables SDR receivers to maintain
robust and accurate Position, Velocity, and Time (PVT) solutions across diverse
dynamic conditions. The optimized configurations yielded maximum position and
velocity errors of approximately 6 m and 0.08 m/s for the static case, 12 m and
2.5 m/s for the rocket case, and 5 m and 0.2 m/s for the LEO case.

Conclusion: DEF方法能够有效量化时间模式的主导时长，为从小数据集中提取不重复的时间模式提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Extracting pulsive temporal patterns from a small dataset without their
repetition or singularity shows significant importance in manufacturing
applications but does not sufficiently attract scientific attention. We propose
to quantify how long temporal patterns appear without relying on their
repetition or singularity, enabling to extract such temporal patterns from a
small dataset. Inspired by the celebrated time delay embedding and data-driven
Hankel matrix analysis, we introduce a linear dynamical system model on the
time-delay coordinates behind the data to derive the discrete-time bases each
of which has a distinct exponential decay constant. The derived bases are
fitted onto subsequences that are extracted with a sliding window in order to
quantify how long patterns are dominant in the set of subsequences. We call the
quantification method Data-driven Exponential Framing (DEF). A toy model-based
experiment shows that DEF can identify multiple patterns with distinct lengths.
DEF is also applied to electric current measurement on a punching machine,
showing its possibility to extract multiple patterns from real-world
oscillatory data.

Abstract: The emergence of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) in
millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, particularly in high-mobility
scenarios, highlights the importance of near-field beam prediction. Unlike the
conventional far-field assumption, near-field beam prediction requires
codebooks that jointly sample the angular and distance domains, which leads to
a dramatic increase in pilot overhead. Moreover, unlike the far- field case
where the optimal beam evolution is temporally smooth, the optimal near-field
beam index exhibits abrupt and nonlinear dynamics due to its joint dependence
on user angle and distance, posing significant challenges for temporal
modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural
Network-Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (CNN-GPT2) based near-field beam
prediction framework. Specifically, an uplink pilot transmission strategy is
designed to enable efficient channel probing through widebeam analog precoding
and frequency-varying digital precoding. The received pilot signals are
preprocessed and passed through a CNN-based feature extractor, followed by a
GPT-2 model that captures temporal dependencies across multiple frames and
directly predicts the near-field beam index in an end-to-end manner.

Conclusion: 主动RIS通过消除被动RIS固有的乘性衰落并将更多资源分配给数据传输，能够提供更高的频谱效率。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology has emerged as a key
enabler for future wireless communications. However, its potential is
constrained by the difficulty of acquiring accurate user-to-RIS channel state
information (CSI), due to the cascaded channel structure and the high pilot
overhead of non-parametric methods. Unlike a passive RIS, where the reflected
signal suffers from multiplicative path loss, an active RIS amplifies the
signal, improving its practicality in real deployments. In this letter, we
propose a parametric channel estimation method tailored for active RISs. The
proposed approach integrates an active RIS model with an adaptive Maximum
Likelihood Estimator (MLE) to recover the main channel parameters using a
minimal number of pilots. To further enhance performance, an adaptive active
RIS configuration strategy is employed, which refines the beam direction based
on an initial user location estimate. Moreover, an orthogonal angle-pair
codebook is used instead of the conventional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
codebook, significantly reducing the codebook size and ensuring reliable
operation for both far-field and near-field users. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-optimal performance with
very few pilots compared to non-parametric approaches. Its performance is also
benchmarked against that of a traditional passive RIS under the same total
power budget to ensure fairness. Results show that active RIS yields higher
spectral efficiency (SE) by eliminating the multiplicative fading inherent in
passive RISs and allocating more resources to data transmission

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting techniques provide a promising supplement
to cryptography-based approaches but rely on dedicated equipment to capture
in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples, hindering their wide adoption. Recent
advances advocate easily obtainable channel state information (CSI) by
commercial WiFi devices for lightweight RF fingerprinting, while falling short
in addressing the challenges of coarse granularity of CSI measurements in an
open-world setting. In this paper, we propose CSI2Q, a novel CSI fingerprinting
system that achieves comparable performance to IQ-based approaches. Instead of
extracting fingerprints directly from raw CSI measurements, CSI2Q first
transforms frequency-domain CSI measurements into time-domain signals that
share the same feature space with IQ samples. Then, we employ a deep auxiliary
learning strategy to transfer useful knowledge from an IQ fingerprinting model
to the CSI counterpart. Finally, the trained CSI model is combined with an
OpenMax function to estimate the likelihood of unknown ones. We evaluate CSI2Q
on one synthetic CSI dataset involving 85 devices and two real CSI datasets,
including 10 and 25 WiFi routers, respectively. Our system achieves accuracy
increases of at least 16% on the synthetic CSI dataset, 20% on the in-lab CSI
dataset, and 17% on the in-the-wild CSI dataset.

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) is attractive for unobtrusive

Abstract: Modal decomposition techniques, such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD),
Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA),
have advanced time-frequency signal analysis since the early 21st century.
These methods are generally classified into two categories: numerical
optimization-based methods (EMD, VMD) and spectral decomposition methods (SSA)
that consider the physical meaning of signals. The former can produce spurious
modes due to the lack of physical constraints, while the latter is more
sensitive to noise and struggles with nonlinear signals. Despite continuous
improvements in these methods, a modal decomposition approach that effectively
combines the strengths of both categories remains elusive. This paper thus
proposes a Robust Modal Decomposition (RMD) method with constrained bandwidth,
which preserves the intrinsic structure of the signal by mapping the time
series into its trajectory-GRAM matrix in phase space. Moreover, the method
incorporates bandwidth constraints during the decomposition process, enhancing
noise resistance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets,
including millimeter-wave radar echoes, electrocardiogram (ECG),
phonocardiogram (PCG), and bearing fault detection data, demonstrate the
method's effectiveness and versatility. All code and dataset samples are

Median on-device latency was 8.7 ms at a 100 Hz loop rate; all sessions were
completed with no device-related adverse events. Conclusions: Multimodal
sensing with low-latency, safety-bounded assistance produced improved movement
quality (TI $\downarrow$) and throughput (ROM, Reps $\uparrow$) in a pilot
technical-feasibility setting, supporting progression to IRB-approved patient
studies. Trial registration: Not applicable (pilot non-clinical).

Abstract: The development of the low-altitude economy has led to a growing prominence
of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) safety management issues. Therefore, accurate
identification, real-time localization, and effective countermeasures have
become core challenges in airspace security assurance. This paper introduces an
integrated UAV management and control system based on deep learning, which
integrates multimodal multi-sensor fusion perception, precise positioning, and
collaborative countermeasures. By incorporating deep learning methods, the
system combines radio frequency (RF) spectral feature analysis, radar
detection, electro-optical identification, and other methods at the detection
level to achieve the identification and classification of UAVs. At the
localization level, the system relies on multi-sensor data fusion and the
air-space-ground integrated communication network to conduct real-time tracking
and prediction of UAV flight status, providing support for early warning and
decision-making. At the countermeasure level, it adopts comprehensive measures
that integrate ``soft kill'' and ``hard kill'', including technologies such as
electromagnetic signal jamming, navigation spoofing, and physical interception,
to form a closed-loop management and control process from early warning to
final disposal, which significantly enhances the response efficiency and
disposal accuracy of low-altitude UAV management.

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的PASS增强型MEC具有比固定PA基线和传统MIMO辅助MEC更强的收敛能力，特别是在用户设备数量多或发射功率高的场景中。

Conclusion: PASS增强型MEC架构通过自适应上行链路波束成形，在动态无线环境中显著提高了任务卸载效率和延迟性能。

Abstract: A pinching-antenna system (PASS)-enhanced mobile edge computing (MEC)
architecture is investigated to improve the task offloading efficiency and
latency performance in dynamic wireless environments. By leveraging dielectric
waveguides and flexibly adjustable pinching antennas, PASS establishes
short-distance line-of-sight (LoS) links while effectively mitigating the
significant path loss and potential signal blockage, making it a promising
solution for high-frequency MEC systems. We formulate a network latency
minimization problem to joint optimize uplink PASS beamforming and task
offloading. The resulting problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP)
and solved via the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. To address the
instability introduced by the $\max$ operator in the objective function, we
propose a load balancing-aware proximal policy optimization (LBPPO) algorithm.
LBPPO incorporates both node-level and waveguide-level load balancing
information into the policy design, maintaining computational and transmission
delay equilibrium, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed PASS-enhanced MEC with adaptive uplink PASS beamforming exhibit
stronger convergence capability than fixed-PA baselines and conventional
MIMO-assisted MEC, especially in scenarios with a large number of UEs or high
transmit power.

Conclusion: PISAC框架有效提升了自动驾驶车辆的安全性和效率，验证了其在实际应用中的有效性

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables simultaneous
localization, environment perception, and data exchange for connected
autonomous vehicles. However, most existing ISAC designs prioritize sensing
accuracy and communication throughput, treating all targets uniformly and
overlooking the impact of critical obstacles on motion efficiency. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a planning-oriented ISAC (PISAC) framework that
reduces the sensing uncertainty of planning-bottleneck obstacles and expands
the safe navigable path for the ego-vehicle, thereby bridging the gap between
physical-layer optimization and motion-level planning. The core of PISAC lies
in deriving a closed-form safety bound that explicitly links ISAC transmit
power to sensing uncertainty, based on the Cram\'er-Rao Bound and occupancy
inflation principles. Using this model, we formulate a bilevel power allocation
and motion planning (PAMP) problem, where the inner layer optimizes the ISAC
beam power distribution and the outer layer computes a collision-free
trajectory under uncertainty-aware safety constraints. Comprehensive
simulations in high-fidelity urban driving environments demonstrate that PISAC
achieves up to 40% higher success rates and over 5% shorter traversal times
than existing ISAC-based and communication-oriented benchmarks, validating its
effectiveness in enhancing both safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) signal recognition plays a critical role in modern

Motivation: 解决未来大规模机器类型通信中大规模连接和低接入延迟的需求，传统正交多址接入方案在无协调随机接入场景下吞吐量有限。

Method: 将时隙ALOHA协议与稀疏码多址接入技术结合，提出IC-first解码策略处理码本碰撞，并引入用户阻挡机制动态调整接入概率。

Conclusion: SCMA-empowered URA方案在无协调大规模接入场景下性能优越，为mMTC提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel uncoordinated random access (URA) protocol is
presented to address the pressing demand for massive connectivity with low
access latency in future massive machine type communication (mMTC) scenarios.
The proposed URA scheme integrates the classical slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA)
protocol with sparse code multiple access (SCMA) technique, referred to as
SCMA-empowered URA. Specifically, active users randomly choose an SCMA codebook
to access the communication network in an arbitrary time slot whenever they
want without scheduling. However, due to the lack of central coordination in
the proposed URA scheme, SCMA codebook collisions become inevitable, making
decoding challenging and leading to increased access failures. To cope with the
decoding issue, an interference-canceling (IC) first decoding strategy is
proposed at the access point (AP), which can partially tackles collision
problems, contributing to a higher system throughput. Taking the proposed
IC-first decoding strategy into account, a closed-form theoretical expression
of the throughput is derived. Moreover, to alleviate the throughput degradation
under the congested user traffic, a user barring mechanism is introduced to
manage the traffic load. Firstly, a closed-form expression of idle codebook
probability is developed to help indicate the system state, i.e., congested or
not. Then, in addition to the estimated real-time load, the AP adaptively
adjusts the access probability and redistributes the actual access load.
Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCMA-empowered URA
scheme enjoys higher maximum throughput, compared to the conventional
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based URA scheme. Moreover, the accuracy of
the presented theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the user barring
mechanism are verified.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) represent a key enabler for
next-generation wireless networks, offering beamforming gains while
significantly reducing radio-frequency chain requirements. In conventional
space-only SIM architectures, the rate of reconfigurability of the SIM is equal
to the inverse of the channel coherence time. This paper investigates a novel
beamforming strategy for massive downlink connectivity using a randomized
space-time (ST) coded SIM. In addition to conventional space-only metasurface
layers, the proposed design integrates a ST metasurface layer at the input
stage of the SIM that introduces random time variations over each channel
coherence time interval. These artificial time variations enable opportunistic
user scheduling and exploitation of multiuser diversity under slow channel
dynamics. To mitigate the prohibitive overhead associated with full channel
state information at the transmitter (CSIT), we propose a partial-CSIT-based
beamforming scheme that leverages randomized steering vectors and limited
user-side feedback based on signal quality measurements. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed ST-SIM architecture achieves satisfactory
sum-rate performance while significantly reducing CSIT acquisition and feedback
overhead, thereby enabling scalable downlink connectivity in dense networks.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel joint uplink and downlink framework
utilizing a pinching antenna system (PASS). We consider two waveguides, one
dedicated to transmission and one to reception, and both of them are connected
to a base station (BS). Each type of waveguide consists of several pinching
antennas (PAs) in some preconfigured positions. In this framework, we assume
the BS can serve downlink and uplink user equipments (UEs) at the same time
using the same spectrum resources through the presented PASS. In this aspect,
we formulate a sum rate optimization problem that jointly optimizes the antenna
activation factor, the BS transmit power, and the UE's transmit power, subject
to power budget constraints for the BS and the UEs, as well as minimum rate
requirements for the UEs. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and
difficult to solve directly. Hence, we divide the main problem into two
sub-problems: the antenna activation sub-problem and the power allocation
sub-problem. Then, we solve the antenna activation problem utilizing a distance
and spatial correlation-based algorithm. Meanwhile, the resource allocation
problem is solved using a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based
algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed framework can achieve
around 60-90\% performance gains over its time division duplex (TDD) where the
uplink and downlink transmissions are served in different orthogonal time
slots.
