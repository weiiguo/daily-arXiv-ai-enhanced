Accepted for presentation as a poster at IEEE INFOCOM 2026", "summary": "This paper proposes a scalable Bayesian optimization (BO) framework for dense base-station (BS) configuration design. BO can find an optimal BS configuration by iterating parameter search, channel simulation, and probabilistic modeling of the objective function. However, its performance is severely affected by the curse of dimensionality, thereby reducing its scalability. To overcome this limitation, the proposed method sequentially optimizes per-BS parameters based on block coordinate descent while fixing the remaining BS configurations, thereby reducing the effective dimensionality of each optimization step. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms naive optimization in dense deployment scenarios."}

To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared with the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load.

In this paper, we show that for a broad class\n  of jointly distributed random variables $(X,Y)$ the Ingleton inequality holds up to a small additive error, even even though the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ is far from being extractable. Contrary to common intuition, strongly non-extractable mutual information does not lead to large violations of the Ingleton inequality in this setting. More precisely, we consider pairs $(X,Y)$ that are uniformly distributed on their joint support and whose associated biregular bipartite graph is an expander. For all auxiliary random variables $A$ and $B$ jointly distributed with $(X,Y)$, we establish a lower bound on the Ingleton quantity $I(X:Y | A) + I(X:Y | B) + I(A:B) - I(X:Y)$ in terms of the spectral parameters of the underlying graph.

In this current study, the authors developed a novel, low-cost, and portable faultdetection system that leverages multimodal sensor fusion and artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring in FDM-based 3D printing. The system integrates acoustic, vibration, and thermal sensing into a non-intrusive architecture, capturing complementary data streams that reflect both mechanical and process-related anomalies. Acoustic and thermal sensors operate in a fully contactless manner, while the vibration sensor requires minimal attachment such that it will not interfere with printer hardware, thereby preserving portability and ease of deployment. The multimodal signals are processed into spectrograms and time-frequency features, which are classified using convolutional neural networks for intelligent fault detection. The proposed system advances Industry 4.0 objectives by offering an affordable, scalable, and practical monitoring solution that improves faultdetection accuracy, reduces waste, and supports sustainable, adaptive manufacturing."}

For moving machinery, vibration analysis and control are crucial. Additive manufacturing is the basis of 3D printing, which utilizes mechanical movement of the extruder to fabricate objects, and faults occur due to unwanted vibrations. Therefore, it is vital to examine the vibration patterns of a 3D printer. In this work, we observe these parameters of an FDM printer, exemplified by the MakerBot Method X. To analyze the system, it is necessary to understand the motion it generates and select appropriate sensors to detect those motions. The sensor measurement values can be used to determine the condition of the printer. We used an accelerometer and an acoustic sensor to measure the vibration and sound produced by the printer. The outputs from these sensors were examined individually. The findings show that vibration occurs at relatively low levels during continuous motion because it mainly appears at component transition edges. Due to abrupt acceleration and deceleration during zigzag motion, vibration reaches its peak."}

In this framework, the communication performance is measured by the multicast rate considering max-min fairness. Moreover, the sensing performance is quantified by the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB), where a Gauss-Hermite quadrature-based approach is proposed to compute the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Based on these metrics, PA placement is optimized under three criteria: communications-centric (C-C), sensing-centric (S-C), and Pareto-optimal designs. These designs are investigated in two scenarios: the single-PA case and the multi-PA case. 1) For the single-PA case, a closed-form solution is derived for the location of the C-C transmit PA, while the S-C design yields optimal transmit and receive PA placements that are symmetric about the target location. Leveraging this geometric insight, the Pareto-optimal design is solved by enforcing this PA placement symmetry, thereby reducing the joint transmit and receive PA placement to the transmit PA optimization. 2) For the general multi-PA case, the PA placements constitute a highly non-convex optimization problem. To solve this, an element-wise alternating optimization-based method is proposed to sequentially optimize all PA placements for the S-C design, and is further incorporated into an augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework and a rate-profile formulation to solve the C-C and Pareto-optimal design problems, respectively. Numerical results show that: i) PASS substantially outperforms fixed-antenna baselines in both multicast rate and sensing accuracy; ii) the multicasting gain becomes more pronounced as the user density increases; and iii) the sensing accuracy improves with the number of deployed PAs."}

A data-processing framework, called SeaSpoofFinder, available here: seaspooffinder.github.io/ais_data, was developed to ingest and post-process global AIS streams and to detect candidate anomalies through a two-stage procedure. In Stage 1, implausible position jumps are identified using kinematic and data-quality filters; in Stage 2, events are retained only when multiple vessels exhibit spatially consistent source and target clustering, thereby reducing false positives from single-vessel artifacts. The resulting final potential spoofing events (FPSEs) reveal recurrent patterns in several regions, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Murmansk, Moscow, and the Haifa area, with affected footprints that can span large maritime areas. The analysis also highlights recurring non-spoofing artifacts (e.g., back-to-port jumps and data gaps) that can still pass heuristic filters in dense traffic regions. These results indicate that AIS-based monitoring can provide useful evidence for identifying and characterizing potential spoofing activity at scale, while emphasizing that AIS-only evidence does not provide definitive attribution."}

We evaluate the impact of input representation by comparing networks trained on raw measurements versus preprocessed features derived from a linearization method. Simulation results show that the learning-based approach consistently outperforms existing linear methods under RSS noise across all noise levels, and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance under increasing AoA noise. Furthermore, preprocessing measurements using the linearization method provides a clear advantage over raw data, demonstrating the benefit of geometry-aware feature extraction."}

We propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, in which the preparation phase performs direction estimation for outdoor users located in the reflection space, while maintaining communication with both outdoor and indoor users in the transmission space. The subsequent communication phase exploits the estimated directions to enhance information transfer. The directions of outdoor users are modeled as Gaussian random variables to capture estimation uncertainty, and the corresponding average communication performance is incorporated into the design. Building on this framework, we formulate a performance-balanced optimization problem that maximizes the communication sum-rate while guaranteeing the required sensing accuracy, jointly determining the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, and the metasurface partition between energy-splitting and transmit-only modes. The physical constraints of STAR-RIS elements and the required sensing performance are explicitly enforced. To address the non-convex nature of the problem, we combine fractional programming, Lagrangian dual reformulation, and successive convex approximation. The binary metasurface partition is ultimately recovered via continuous relaxation followed by projection-based binarization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves an effective trade-off between sensing accuracy and communication throughput, by significantly outperforming conventional STAR-RIS-aided ISAC schemes."}

This work presents and validates a simple local real-time phase calibration method for a digital array. We compare two different approaches, instantaneous and smoothed calibration, to determine the optimal interval between synchronization procedures. To quantitatively assess calibration performance, we use two metrics: the average beamforming power loss and the RMS cycle-to-cycle jitter. Our results indicate that both approaches for phase calibration are effective and yield RMS of jitter in the 2.1 ps to 124 fs range for different SDR models. This level of precision enables coherent transmission on commonly available SDR platforms, allowing investigation on advanced MIMO techniques and transmit beamforming in practical testbeds."}

However, the cascaded AmBC channel suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is highly challenging due to the weak backscattered signal and the resource-limited nature of BDs. To address these challenges, this paper considers an AmBC system in which the reader is equipped with a pixel-based fluid antenna system (FAS). By dynamically selecting one antenna position from a dense set of pixels within a compact aperture, the FAS-enabled reader exploits spatial diversity through measurement-driven port selection, without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains. The intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff at the BD is also incorporated by jointly optimizing the backscatter modulation coefficient under an energy harvesting (EH) neutrality constraint. To efficiently solve this problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based framework is developed to jointly determine the FAS port selection and modulation coefficient on an optimize-then-average (OTA) basis.

To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes."}
