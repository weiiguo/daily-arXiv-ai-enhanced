How does this multiscale structure come about? We argue\nthat it reflects an emergent hierarchy of scales that contribute to the\nsystem's causal workings. An example is how a computer can be described at the\nlevel of its hardware circuitry but also its software. But we show that many\nsystems, even simple ones, have such an emergent hierarchy, built from a small\nsubset of all their possible scales of description. Formally, we extend the\ntheory of causal emergence (2.0) so as to analyze the causal contributions\nacross the full multiscale structure of a system rather than just over a single\npath that traverses the system's scales. Our methods reveal that systems can be\nclassified as being causally top-heavy or bottom-heavy, or their emergent\nhierarchies can be highly complex. We argue that this provides a more specific\nnotion of scale-freeness (here, when causation is spread equally across the\nscales of a system) than the standard network science terminology. More\nbroadly, we provide the mathematical tools to quantify this complexity and\nprovide diverse examples of the taxonomy of emergent hierarchies.

To this end, we first develop an anti-jamming modulation scheme that\nuses a spreading matrix to distribute each symbol across multiple subcarriers,\nenhancing robustness against jamming. For optimal demodulation at a receiver,\nwe devise a maximum likelihood detection (MLD) method and its low-complexity\nvariant tailored to our anti-jamming modulation scheme in scenarios with known\njamming variance. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) of our modulation scheme\nto optimize its modulation order according to a jamming scenario. To adapt to\ndynamic and unknown jamming environments, we present a jamming-adaptive\ncommunication framework consisting of two phases: (i) a jamming-noncoherent\nphase and (ii) a jamming-coherent phase. In the jamming-noncoherent phase, we\ndevelop an approximate MLD method that operates without prior knowledge of\njamming variance and enables the estimation of jamming parameters. In the\njamming-coherent phase, we use these estimated parameters to optimize the\nproposed modulation scheme while employing the low-complexity MLD method.\nSimulation results demonstrate the superior BER performance of the proposed\nanti-jamming framework compared to existing OFDM communication frameworks\nacross a wide range of communication and jamming scenarios."}
