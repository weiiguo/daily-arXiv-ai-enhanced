This paper presents a novel\ntransceiver that achieves high receiver sensitivity and low computational\ncomplexity. At the transmitter, we replace the conventional direct sequence\nspread spectrum (DSSS) preamble with a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) preamble,\nconsisting of a pair of down-chirp and up-chirp signals that are conjugate to\neach other, simplifying packet synchronization. For enhanced coverage, the\npayload incorporates continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) to\nmaintain a constant envelope and phase continuity, in conjunction with DSSS to\nachieve a high spreading gain. At the receiver, we develop a double-peak\ndetection method to improve synchronization and a non-coherent joint\ndespreading and demodulation scheme that increases receiver sensitivity while\nmaintaining simplicity in implementation. Furthermore, we optimize the preamble\ndetection threshold and spreading sequences for maximum non-coherent receiver\nperformance. The software-defined radio (SDR) prototype, developed using GNU\nRadio and USRP, along with operational snapshots, showcases its practical\nengineering applications. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and field-test\ntrials demonstrate that our transceiver outperforms traditional ones in terms\nof receiver sensitivity, while also being low in complexity and cost-effective\nfor LPWAN requirements."}

To this end, we first design the BS location\nembedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS\nlocation information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the\ncross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to\nrespectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as\nthat among target BSs.

ELAAs\nsignificantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial\nresolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift\ncommunication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where\nspherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle\nand distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel\nestimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field\nscenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This\npaper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel\nestimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an\nelectromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences,\nalongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream\nnear-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major\nestimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations\n(single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and\nRIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among\nestimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide\ninsights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel\nestimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research\ndirections."}

A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to\nsimultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and\ncounteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive\nsingle-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as\nwell as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's\nlocation. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays\nthe role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers\nchannels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly\ndistributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the\nergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for\ntarget localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves\ncomputing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability.
