### [1] [Nonlinear Stacked Intelligent Surfaces for Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23780)
*Omran Abbas,Abdullah Zayat,Loıc Markley,Anas Chaaban*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出非线性堆叠智能表面(SIS)技术，能够模拟神经网络行为，相比传统线性SIS能提高通信可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SIS只能进行线性操作，限制了其应用潜力。为了释放SIS的更多可能性，需要开发非线性SIS来模拟神经网络行为

Method: 设计具有阶跃响应的非线性SIS单元，并在MIMO系统中优化SIS结构以最小化符号错误率，仅使用统计信道信息

Result: 非线性SIS相比线性SIS能提高通信可靠性，通过在SIS表面形成复杂信号模式，提供更高的抗噪声干扰多样性

Conclusion: 非线性SIS具有在无线通信场景中的多种潜在应用，能够显著提升系统性能

Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) are a promising technology for
next-generation wireless systems, offering an opportunity to enhance
communication performance with low power consumption. Typically, an SIS is
modelled as a surface that imparts phase shifts on impinging electromagnetic
signals to achieve desired communication objectives. However, this mode of
operation results in a linear SIS, which limits its applicability to linear
operations. To unlock further SIS potential, we propose a nonlinear SIS that
can mimic the behaviour of nonlinear neural networks. We discuss the
feasibility and potential of this idea and propose a nonlinear SIS unit cell
with a step-like response. To evaluate the system-level performance of
nonlinear SIS, we present a case study where SIS structures are optimized to
minimize the symbol error rate (SER) in an MIMO system with SIS deployed at
both the transmitter and receiver sides using only statistical channel
information. We demonstrate that a nonlinear SIS can improve communication
reliability compared to a linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns across
the SIS surface, which provide higher diversity against noise disturbances,
while still allowing the receiver to discern these patterns. Finally, we
outline several potential applications of nonlinear SIS in wireless
communication scenarios.

### [2] [Communication in a Fractional World: MIMO MC-OTFS Precoder Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23832)
*Evan Allen,Karim Said,Robert Calderbank,Lingjia Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理信息的复杂指数基扩展模型预测框架，用于解决高移动性MIMO通信中CSI反馈的挑战，特别针对OTFS调制环境下的延迟-多普勒信道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G技术的发展，高移动性场景如VANETs和FANETs需要支持MIMO技术，但传统时频CSI反馈方案在快速变化的信道条件下负担过重，因此需要转向OTFS调制等延迟-多普勒表示方法。

Method: 推导了OTFS输入输出关系随时间变化的表达式，并基于此创建了物理信息的复杂指数基扩展模型预测框架，最大化过时CSI在整数和分数延迟-多普勒信道中的有效性。

Result: 该框架能够有效处理高移动性MIMO通信中的信道状态信息预测问题，特别是在OTFS调制环境下。

Conclusion: 提出的物理信息预测框架为高移动性MIMO通信提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在延迟-多普勒信道条件下。

Abstract: As 6G technologies advance, international bodies and regulatory agencies are
intensifying efforts to extend seamless connectivity especially for
high-mobility scenarios such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{MANETs}) types
such as Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{VANETs}) and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks
(\textit{FANETs}). For these environments to be considered for long term
adoption and use they must support Multiple-Input-Multiple- (MIMO) technology,
rapidly fluctuating channel conditions in these environments place a heavy
burden on traditional time-frequency CSI feedback schemes required for MIMO
precoding. This motivates a shift toward delay-Doppler representations like
those employed by Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space(OTFS) modulation, which
offers greater stability under mobility. We derive an expression for the
variation over time in the OTFS I/O relationship. We then use this to create a
physics informed complex exponential basis expansion model prediction framework
that maximizes the usefulness of outdated Channel State Information (CSI) in
the presence of integer and fractional delay-Doppler channels and facilitates
high mobility MIMO communication.

### [3] [Coordinated Multipoint Transmission in Pinching Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23837)
*Ali Amhaz,Shreya Khisa,Mohamed Elhattab,Chadi Assi,Sanaa Sharafeddine*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于梯度元学习(GML)的优化方法，用于协调多点(CoMP)传输系统中联合优化波束成形向量和捏合天线位置，以最大化系统可实现总速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoMP系统采用均匀线性阵列时存在速率上限限制，而捏合天线技术能够克服MIMO系统中的大尺度衰落问题，因此研究如何将该技术优势应用于CoMP系统。

Method: 采用梯度元学习(GML)策略来解决非凸优化问题，联合确定发射波束成形向量和波导上的捏合位置，同时满足用户服务质量要求。

Result: 数值分析表明，所提出的GML方法达到了最优解的92%，优于其他基准方法，并且相比传统CoMP系统实现了更高的速率上限。

Conclusion: 基于捏合天线的CoMP系统结合GML优化方法能够有效提升系统性能，克服传统系统的速率限制。

Abstract: We study a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission where two base
stations (BSs), each supported by a pinching antenna system (PASS), are
deployed to jointly serve communication users under spatial division multiple
access (SDMA) technology. Pinching Antenna technology was introduced as a
promising solution to overcome the large-scale fading that has been shown to be
an impediment in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To realize the
advantages of this technology in CoMP systems, which suffer from an upperbound
rate limitation when traditional uniform linear arrays (ULAs) are adopted, we
formulate an optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the achievable sum
rate by jointly determining the transmit beamforming vectors and pinching
locations on the waveguides while respecting the quality of service (QoS)
requirements of users. This problem is inherently non-convex due to the strong
coupling among its decision parameters, making it challenging to solve using
traditional optimization methods. Thus, we utilize a gradient-based
meta-learning (GML) strategy specifically designed for large-scale optimization
tasks. Finally, numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed GML approach, achieving 92 percent of the optimal solution, and the
superiority of the solution presented compared to other benchmarks. In
addition, it achieves a higher upper bound on the achievable rate compared to
conventional CoMP systems.

### [4] [Accurate Prediction of Nonlinear Distortion of Multi-Carrier Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23844)
*Cameron M. Pike,Brad Oney,Gabriel Hepner,Animesh Yadav*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 使用特征函数级数方法预测稀疏多载波传输的非线性失真频谱，该方法计算效率高，通过理论和实验验证了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 功率放大器的非线性特性会严重影响多载波调制技术，需要准确预测非线性失真以在设计输出功率和网络吞吐量之间做出权衡。

Method: 采用特征函数级数方法，将非线性表示为前向散射参数或跨导函数的FFT，失真贡献表示为干净频谱的数值自卷积。

Result: 理论验证表明该方法与经典Price定理结果一致；实验验证显示预测输出频谱与实验室测量结果相符，可轻松计算信号失真比。

Conclusion: 特征函数级数方法能有效预测非线性失真频谱，计算效率高，适用于难以应用Price定理的复杂场景。

Abstract: Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation
techniques. Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making
design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the
series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion
spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in
efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The
method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation
is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard
limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are
identical with the classical Price's theorem. Practical validation is shown by
considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a
fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into
compression for which application of Price's theorem is difficult, and the
predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the
computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed
as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering
parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects),
and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical
autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be
easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as
overdrive level.

### [5] [Learning-based Spectral Regression for Cocoa Bean Physicochemical Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23892)

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可可豆质量评估方法耗时、破坏性且难以扩展，需要快速、可靠、非侵入性的替代方案。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了在可可生产链中进行质量评估的合适且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Cocoa bean quality assessment is essential for ensuring compliance with
commercial standards, protecting consumer health, and increasing the market
value of the cocoa product. The quality assessment estimates key
physicochemical properties, such as fermentation level, moisture content,
polyphenol concentration, and cadmium content, among others. This assessment
has traditionally relied on the accurate estimation of these properties via
visual or sensory evaluation, jointly with laboratory-based physicochemical
analyses, which are often time-consuming, destructive, and difficult to scale.
This creates the need for rapid, reliable, and noninvasive alternatives.
Spectroscopy, particularly in the visible and near-infrared ranges, offers a
non-invasive alternative by capturing the molecular signatures associated with
these properties. Therefore, this work introduces a scalable methodology for
evaluating the quality of cocoa beans by predicting key physicochemical
properties from the spectral signatures of cocoa beans. This approach utilizes
a conveyor belt system integrated with a VIS-NIR spectrometer, coupled with
learning-based regression models. Furthermore, a dataset is built using cocoa
bean batches from Santander, Colombia. Ground-truth reference values were
obtained through standardized laboratory analyses and following commercial
cocoa quality regulations. To further evaluate the proposed methodology's
generalization, performance is tested on samples collected from other Colombian
regions and from Cusco, Peru. Experimental results show that the proposed
models achieved R2 scores exceeding 0.98 across all physicochemical properties,
and reached 0.96 accuracy on geographically independent samples. This
non-destructive approach represents a suitable and scalable alternative to
conventional laboratory methods for quality assessment across the cocoa
production chain.

Result: 开发了一个能够准确表征NLOS链路PSD的几何感知信道模型。

Conclusion: 该模型为LEO到地面通信系统的非视距链路提供了更准确和物理意义明确的功率谱密度表征。

Abstract: This paper presents a new derivation of LEO-to-ground receiver channel model
to address a clear gap in the prior art: the lack of an appropriate geometry
aware characterization of non LOS (NLOS) link model represented by the power
spectral density (PSD). Specifically, the main contribution is a coherent
derivation of the PSD from 1st principles that is able to reproduce results in
prior art and explain the causal relationship of main PSD features to the
propagation geometry parameters.

### [7] [Inferring Group Intent as a Cooperative Game. An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23905)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于合作博弈论和NLP生成模型的群体目标轨迹意图分析方法，通过Fisher信息特征函数和图变换神经网络来形式化和推断群体轨迹意图。

Conclusion: 该方法为群体目标轨迹意图的形式化和推断提供了有效的多层级解决方案，结合了博弈论、生成模型和深度学习技术。

Abstract: This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a
cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an
NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by
the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players
in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or
the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that
govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect
the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the
intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic
function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy
observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a
Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which
yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal
patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based
generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic
multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph
Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as
the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data
with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the
track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer
approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN
(for group intent inference).

### [8] [Machine Learning-Driven User Localization in RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23908)
*M. T. Hassan,D. Zelenchuk,M. A. B. Abbasi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的用户定位框架，用于RIS辅助的6G通信，通过测量四个角扇区的接收信号功率来实时预测用户角度位置，显著减少波束探测开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G需要毫米波频段的超可靠低延迟通信，但RIS扩展了波束搜索空间，使穷举扫描效率低下。需要减少控制开销和延迟。

Method: 使用20x20 RIS在27GHz频段反射信号，将0-90度俯仰平面分为四个角扇区。构建接收功率数据集，训练多种回归模型（DT、SVR、KNN、XGBoost等）。用户测量四个扇区的接收功率值，RIS控制器实时预测角度位置。

Result: 决策树模型达到MAE=4.8度，R²=0.96的高精度，其他模型达到70-86%准确率。预测辐射模式与真实值高度一致，主瓣对准在52-55度之间。

Conclusion: 该框架减少了波束探测，实现更快的对准，降低了RIS辅助6G网络的延迟。

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) targets ultra reliable, low latency (URLLC) gigabit
connectivity in mmWave bands, where directional channels require precise beam
alignment. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) reshape wave propagation
and extend coverage, but they enlarge the beam search space at the base
station, making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and
latency. We propose an ML based user localization framework for RIS assisted
communication at 27 GHz. A 20x20 RIS reflects signals from a core network
connected base station and sweeps beams across the 0-90 degree elevation plane,
divided into four angular sectors. We build a dataset by recording received
signal power (Pr in dBm) across user locations and train multiple regressors,
including decision tree (DT), support vector regressor (SVR), k nearest
neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, gradient boosting, and random forest. In operation, an
unknown user in the same plane measures four received power values (one per
sector) and reports them to the pretrained RIS controller, which predicts the
user's angular position in real time. Evaluation using mean absolute error
(MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R squared (R2) shows high accuracy.
The DT model achieves an MAE of 4.8 degrees with R2 = 0.96, while other models
reach 70 to 86 percent. Predicted radiation patterns, including main lobe
alignment between 52 and 55 degrees, closely track ground truth. The framework
reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS
assisted 6G networks.

### [9] [Localized Acoustic-Event Measurement Probe: Connector Confirmation Utilizing Acoustic Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24017)
*Brian Skoglind,Travis Roberts,Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron Turner,Laine Mears*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于声学检测的电气连接状态验证方法，通过物理降噪系统和声音特征放大算法提高连接声音与工厂环境噪音的信噪比，无需改变现有手动连接流程即可实现75%以上的连接状态检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电子产品中大量电气连接仍依赖人工操作，容易因连接力不均或人为疲劳导致连接不良，造成停机返工。现有视觉、AR或电路参数检测方法在连接状态识别方面存在局限，而基于声音的检测方法因连接声音与环境噪音信噪比低而未被充分研究。

Method: 采用物理系统进行背景噪音抑制，并结合成功连接声音特征放大算法，提高电气连接声音与工厂环境声音的信噪比，从而改善连接成功检测能力。

Result: 该解决方案在检测和分类连接状态方面有效性超过75%，且无需对现有手动互连流程进行任何修改。

Conclusion: 声学检测方法结合物理降噪和声音特征放大技术，能够有效识别电气连接状态，为解决自动化装配线中手动连接质量问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern consumer products are full of interconnected electrical and electronic
modules to fulfill direct and indirect needs. In an automated assembly line
still, most of these interconnections are required to be done manually due to
the large variety of connector types, connector positions, and the soft,
flexible nature of their structures. The manual connection points are the
source of partial or completely loose connections. Sometimes connections are
missed due to the application of unequal mating forces and natural human
fatigue. Subsequently, these defects can lead to unexpected downtime and
expensive rework. For successful connection detection, past approaches such as
vision verification, Augmented Reality, or circuit parameter-based measurements
have shown limited ability to detect the correct connection state. Though most
connections emit a specific noise for successful mating, the acoustic-based
verification system for electrical connection confirmation has not been
extensively researched. The main discouraging reason for such research is the
typically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the sound of a pair of
electrical connector mating and the diverse soundscape of the plant. In this
study, the authors investigated increasing the SNR between the electrical
connector mating sound and the plant soundscape to improve connection success
detection by employing a physical system for background noise mitigation and
the successful met noise signature amplification algorithm. The solution is
over 75% effective at detecting and classifying connection state. The solution
has been constructed without any modification to the existing manual
interconnection process.

*Zihan Zhao,Masood Mortazavi,Ning Yan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: PULSE框架利用EDA进行自监督预训练，但在推理时仅使用ECG、BVP、ACC和TEMP等低成本传感器，通过知识转移将EDA的应激检测能力迁移到其他模态上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EDA硬件成本高且在现实可穿戴设备中不普及的问题，通过知识转移让低成本传感器也能获得高质量的应激检测能力。

Method: 将编码器输出分为共享和私有嵌入，对齐共享嵌入并融合为模态不变表示，私有嵌入支持重构目标。预训练后通过冻结的EDA教师模型将交感神经唤醒表示转移到学生编码器。

Result: 在WESAD数据集上实现了强大的应激检测性能，证明了特权EDA表示可以转移到低成本传感器上。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在降低硬件成本的同时提高应激检测的准确性，为现实世界可穿戴设备提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA), the primary signal for stress detection,
requires costly hardware often unavailable in real-world wearables. In this
paper, we propose PULSE, a framework that utilizes EDA exclusively during
self-supervised pretraining, while enabling inference without EDA but with more
readily available modalities such as ECG, BVP, ACC, and TEMP. Our approach
separates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared
embeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant
representation. The private embeddings carry modality-specific information to
support the reconstruction objective. Pretraining is followed by knowledge
transfer where a frozen EDA teacher transfers sympathetic-arousal
representations into student encoders. On WESAD, our method achieves strong
stress-detection performance, showing that representations of privileged EDA
can be transferred to low-cost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing
hardware cost.

Conclusion: 子带全双工是带内全双工的有效替代方案，能够在无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统中实现高效的同时通信和感知功能。

Abstract: In-band Full-duplex joint communication and sensing systems require self
interference cancellation as well as decoupling of the mutual interference
between UL communication signals and radar echoes. We present sub-band
full-duplex as an alternative duplexing scheme to achieve simultaneous uplink
communication and target parameter estimation in a cell-free massive MIMO
system. Sub-band full-duplex allows uplink and downlink transmissions
simultaneously on non-overlapping frequency resources via explicitly defined
uplink and downlink sub-bands in each timeslot. Thus, we propose a sub-band
full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO system with active downlink sensing on
downlink sub-bands and uplink communication on uplink sub-band. In the proposed
system, the target illumination signal is transmitted on the downlink (radar)
sub-band whereas uplink users transmit on the uplink (communication) sub-band.
By assuming efficient suppression of inter-sub-band interference between radar
and communication sub-bands, uplink communication and radar signals can be
efficiently processed without mutual interference. We show that each AP can
estimate sensing parameters with high accuracy in SBFD cell-free massive MIMO
JCAS systems.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效保护无线通信中的用户隐私，防止信号被自动调制分类系统识别和拦截。

Abstract: The advancements in Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) have propelled
the development of signal sensing and identification technologies in
non-cooperative communication scenarios but also enable eavesdroppers to
effectively intercept user signals in wireless communication environments. To
protect user privacy in communication links, we have optimized the adversarial
example generation model and introduced a novel framework for generating
adversarial perturbations for transmitted signals. This framework implements
dual-domain constraints in both the time and frequency domains, ensuring that
the adversarial perturbation cannot be filtered out. Comparative experiments
confirm the superiority of the proposed method and the concealment of the
adversarial examples it generates.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种OFDM导频失真方法，通过设计子载波失真向量来增加失配模糊函数的旁瓣，从而干扰到达时间估计，同时保持通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在单基站场景下，通过导频失真来干扰到达时间估计，同时不显著影响通信性能，提供一种无需协议修改或人工路径注入的信号级机制。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种在通信约束下控制到达时间可观测性的信号级机制，无需协议更改或人工路径注入。

Abstract: We study uplink orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot
distortion to deliberately obfuscate time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation at a
single base station while preserving communication performance. We design a
complex per-subcarrier distortion vector that increases sidelobes of the
mismatched ambiguity function (MAF) relative to its mainlobe, using two
objectives: the sidelobe-to-peak level ratio and the integrated sidelobe level.
The design is subject to a transmit-power budget and a proximity
(dissimilarity) constraint around the communication-optimal pilot.
Communication impact is quantied by a capacity-motivated lower bound obtained
from the linear minimum mean-squared error error covariance with a mismatched
channel estimate. The resulting generalized fractional program is solved with
Dinkelbach's transform and a difference-of-convex update that yields a
closed-form Karush-Kuhn-Tucker step. Simulations on a single-input
single-output OFDM link show that the optimized distortions raise MAF sidelobes
and degrade delay estimation, as validated by a mismatched maximum-likelihood
ToA estimator, while incurring only marginal capacity loss over a broad
signal-to-noise ratio range. The method requires no protocol changes or
artificial path injection and provides a signal-level mechanism to control ToA
observability under communication constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a full-duplex (FD) Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) system, in which the base station (BS) performs downlink
and uplink communications with multiple users while simultaneously sensing
multiple targets. In the scope of this work, we assume a narrowband and static
scenario, aiming to focus on the beamforming and power allocation strategies.
We propose a joint beamforming strategy for designing transmit and receive
beamformer vectors at the BS. The optimization problem aims to maximize the
communication sum-rate, which is critical for ensuring high-quality service to
users, while also maintaining accurate sensing performance for detection tasks
and adhering to maximum power constraints for efficient resource usage. The
optimal receive beamformers are first derived using a closed-form Generalized
Rayleigh Quotient (GRQ) solution, reducing the variables to be optimized. Then,
the remaining problem is solved using floating-point Genetic Algorithms (GA).
The numerical results show that the proposed GA-based solution demonstrates up
to a 98% enhancement in sum-rate compared to a baseline half-duplex ISAC system
and provides better performance than a benchmark algorithm from the literature.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for low-altitude
wireless network (LAWN), particularly when terrestrial networks are
unavailable. In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically
unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet
challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training
and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated
sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground
users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT
server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs
accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV
sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight
safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme
that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the
twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous
trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring
obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission
completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and
efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.

### [16] [Towards actionable hypotension prediction- predicting catecholamine therapy initiation in the intensive care unit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24287)
*Richard Koebe,Noah Saibel,Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz,Simon Schäfer,Nils Strodthoff*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个机器学习模型来预测ICU患者是否需要启动儿茶酚胺治疗，而不是仅仅预测低血压。模型基于MIMIC-III数据库，使用XGBoost算法，在15分钟预测窗口内实现了0.822的AUROC，优于传统低血压预测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU患者低血压常见且危及生命，但现有机器学习模型主要预测固定MAP阈值或MAP预测，忽略了临床治疗升级决策。预测儿茶酚胺启动能更好地反映临床实际决策过程。

Method: 使用MIMIC-III数据库，将儿茶酚胺启动建模为15分钟预测窗口内的二元事件。输入特征包括两小时滑动MAP窗口的统计描述符、人口统计学、生物特征、合并症和当前治疗。采用XGBoost模型并通过SHAP进行解释。

Result: 模型AUROC为0.822(0.813-0.830)，显著优于低血压基线(MAP<65，AUROC 0.686)。SHAP分析显示近期MAP值、MAP趋势和当前治疗是主要预测因子。在男性、年轻患者、高BMI患者和无合并症患者中表现更好。

Conclusion: 基于MAP动态、治疗背景和患者特征预测儿茶酚胺启动支持治疗升级的关键决策，将重点从基于阈值的警报转向可操作的决策支持。该方法在自然事件不平衡的广泛ICU队列中可行。

Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening.
Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both
undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML)
models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting,
overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting
catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent
administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real
decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine
initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input
features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context
window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing
treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and
interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an
AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65,
AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP
trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant
predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger
patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without
comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation
based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports
the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from
threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is
feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work
should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to
include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension
prediction systems.

Conclusion: 该方案成功实现了与CP-OFDMA框架完全兼容的恒包络波形设计，在保持良好性能的同时大幅降低了系统复杂度，为多用户下行链路提供了有效的功率效率解决方案。

Abstract: OFDM is widely adopted in modern wireless communication systems, but its
power efficiency is limited by high envelope fluctuations. Although various
high power-efficiency waveforms have been proposed, most are incompatible with
the CP-OFDMA framework and remain ineffective in multi-user downlink
transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a constant-envelope (CE)
waveform design, which enables low-complexity transceiver architectures while
maintaining full compatibility with the prevailing CP-OFDMA framework.
Specifically, we start from a general CE FDMA signal model and develop a
CP-OFDMA-compatible waveform implementation structure, followed by the design
of an optimized CE-constrained pulse-shaping filter to suppress out-of-band
emissions. To tackle channel estimation challenge under non-flat
frequency-domain pilots induced by CE modulation, we optimize the time-domain
binary pilot sequence to achieve frequency-domain CE properties, and then
propose a multi-stage method combining delay-domain denoising with power delay
profile estimation to facilitate reduced-dimension LMMSE estimation.
Subsequently, we design a low-complexity maximum ratio combining-aided LMMSE
equalizer by exploiting the periodicity and conjugate symmetry of the CE
received signals. To mitigate the downlink peak-to-average power ratio increase
caused by FDMA, we further develop a multi-user downlink CE transmission scheme
including multiple access mechanism, downlink control information design, and
corresponding system-level implementation, which ensures compatibility with the
New Radio standard. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
achieves bit error rate performance close to the ideal case while significantly
reducing transceiver complexity compared to existing CE waveform solutions.

TL;DR: 提出基于学习的CSI预测框架，利用无线信道的时间相关性预测未来SINR值，以缓解TDD 5G系统中的信道老化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TDD系统中由于用户移动性和处理延迟导致的信道老化会降低CSI准确性，影响链路自适应和系统性能。

Method: 使用全连接DNN和LSTM网络在有效SINR域进行预测，通过EESM映射确保与现有5G标准兼容，无需连续导频信号。

Result: LSTM预测器在中等多普勒条件下相比无预测基线，NMSE改善达2dB，吞吐量增益达1.2Mbps。

Conclusion: 轻量级AI驱动的CSI预测能有效缓解信道老化，增强TDD 5G系统的链路自适应能力。

Abstract: Time division duplexing (TDD) has become the dominant duplexing mode in 5G
and beyond due to its ability to exploit channel reciprocity for efficient
downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, channel aging
caused by user mobility and processing delays degrades the accuracy of CSI,
leading to suboptimal link adaptation and loss of performance. To address this
issue, we propose a learning-based CSI prediction framework that leverages
temporal correlations in wireless channels to forecast future signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values. The prediction operates in the
effective SINR domain, obtained via exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM),
ensuring full compatibility with existing 5G standards without requiring
continuous pilot signaling. Two models are considered: a fully connected deep
neural network (DNN) and an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based network. The
simulation results show that the LSTM predictor achieves an improvement of up
to 2 dB in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and a gain of up to 1.2 Mbps
throughput over a baseline without prediction under moderate Doppler
conditions. These results confirm the potential of lightweight AI-based CSI
prediction to effectively mitigate channel aging and enhance link adaptation in
TDD 5G systems.

Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing
AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging
research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and
estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by
traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver
efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI
problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently
deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with
traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver
design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential
of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions
brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further
adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.

### [20] [Quality Coefficients for Interferometric Phase Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24512)
*Magnus Heimpel,Irena Hajnsek,Othmar Frey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种用于多时相InSAR相位链接的质量评估系数，用于筛选可靠的分布式散射体像素：基于闭合相位的内部一致性系数、拟合优度系数和模糊度系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多时相InSAR中，相位链接估计的相位历史需要评估其可靠性，以排除不可靠像素。现有质量指标缺乏统一框架和标准化处理。

Method: 在统一数学框架下提出三个标准化系数：闭合相位系数评估相位信息内部一致性；拟合优度系数评估相位历史估计对原始相位信息的拟合程度；模糊度系数比较原始估计与正交替代解的拟合优度。

Result: 在瑞士Visp的TerraSAR-X数据实验中，闭合相位系数有效预筛选稳定区域，拟合优度系数与现有质量指标一致并系统化推广，模糊度系数标记拟合良好但不稳定的解。

Conclusion: 这三种系数共同实现了分布式散射体干涉处理中的系统性像素选择和质量控制，提高了跨不同大小数据堆栈的可解释性。

Abstract: In multi-temporal InSAR, phase linking refers to the estimation of a
single-reference interferometric phase history from the information contained
in the coherence matrix of a distributed scatterer. Since the phase information
in the coherence matrix is typically inconsistent, the extent to which the
estimated phase history captures it must be assessed to exclude unreliable
pixels from further processing. We introduce three quality criteria in the form
of coefficients, for threshold-based pixel selection: a coefficient based on
closure phase that quantifies the internal consistency of the phase information
in the coherence matrix; a goodness-of-fit coefficient that quantifies how well
a resulting phase history estimate approximates the phase information according
to the characteristic optimization model of a given phase linking method; and
an ambiguity coefficient that compares the goodness of fit of the original
estimate with that of an orthogonal alternative. We formulate the phase linking
methods and these criteria within a unified mathematical framework and discuss
computational and algorithmic aspects. Unlike existing goodness-of-fit
indicators, the proposed coefficients are normalized to the unit interval with
explicit noise-floor correction, improving interpretability across stacks of
different size. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data over Visp, Switzerland, indicate
that the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the
goodness-of-fit coefficient aligns with and systematically generalizes
established quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient flags solutions
that fit well but are unstable. Together, the coefficients enable systematic
pixel selection and quality control in the interferometric processing of
distributed scatterers.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are poised to seamlessly integrate communication,
computing, localization, and sensing functionalities, ensuring high reliability
and trustworthiness. This paper introduces Smart Sensing Feedback (SSF), a
limited-feedback framework designed to enhance sensing capabilities while
maintaining communication performance. SSF adapts the concept of retransmission
from communication to sensing. Specifically, we focus on downlink (DL) bistatic
sensing, where the User Equipment (UE) performs measurements from reflected
sensing signals and provides feedback to the network (NW). In sensing services,
UE reporting can vary significantly due to dynamic factors such as target
characteristics, environmental conditions, and UE status. Our results
demonstrate that SSF significantly improves sensing quality while preserving
communication efficiency. Additionally, it enhances key performance metrics
such as probability of detection, latency, and power consumption. These
improvements underscore SSF's ability to deliver robust, low-overhead feedback
and adaptability to support a wide range of ISAC applications.

Conclusion: 所提出的宽带超表面可作为提高雷达和无线系统频谱效率和安全性性能的有效候选方案，支持高分辨率目标检测、抗干扰波束控制和物理层安全。

Abstract: Digital metasurfaces have attracted significant attention in recent years due
to their ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves for secure sensing
and communication. However, most reported metasurfaces operate at relatively
high frequencies, primarily due to the constraints imposed by the physical
scale of the dielectric substrate, thus limiting their full-wave system
applications. In this work, a wideband digital reflective metasurface is
presented for capable of dynamically controlling EM waves, with multifunctional
applications in the lower-frequency S-band. The metasurface is composed of
electronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with wideband characteristics, and
designed by using trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by a pin diode.
Simulation results show that the proposed digital metasurface could achieve
wideband 1-bit phase quantization with a stable phase difference within 180
degree +/- 25 degree and small reflection loss below 0.6 dB from 2.72 to 3.25
GHz. To validate the proposed design, a 20x20-unit metasurface array was
designed, simulated and fabricated. By dynamically adjusting the coding
sequence, the metasurface could enable multi-mode orbital angular momentum
(OAM) beam generation, dynamic beam scanning, and precise direction finding.
These capabilities support secure sensing and secure communications through
high-resolution target detection and anti-jamming beam steering, as well as
physical-layer security. The proposed wideband metasurface may serve as an
effective candidate for enhancing spectral efficiency and security performance
in radar and wireless systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种灵活智能分层超表面（FILM）架构，通过使用可形变柔性超表面层替代传统刚性超表面，显著减少了所需层数，同时保持信号处理性能，在性能和功耗方面优于传统堆叠智能超表面。


<details>

Motivation: 传统堆叠智能超表面（SIMs）依赖均匀层间距且需要深层堆叠来确保处理能力，导致实际应用中严重的功率衰减问题。

Method: 开发了两层FILM辅助的多用户多输入单输出系统，采用交替优化方法解决信道拟合问题，包括闭式相位偏移更新和基于梯度下降的形状优化。

Result: 仿真结果显示，所提出的透射式FILM架构相比传统七层SIMs，在总速率上实现了超过200%的提升，在误码率方面获得了超过7 dB的增益。

Conclusion: FILM架构通过动态调整传输系数矩阵，在减少层数的同时保持了信号处理性能，为解决传统SIMs的功率衰减问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently gained attention as a
paradigm for wave-domain signal processing with reduced reliance on costly
radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, conventional SIMs rely on uniform
inter-layer spacing and require deep stacking to ensure processing capability,
resulting in severe power attenuation in practice. To address this issue, we
propose a flexible intelligent layered metasurface (FILM) architecture
consisting of two shape-controllable flexible metasurface layers. By replacing
rigid metasurfaces with flexible ones in both layers, the transmission
coefficient matrix can be dynamically adjusted, significantly decreasing the
number of required layers while maintaining signal processing performance.
Firstly, we develop a two-layer FILM-assisted multi-user multiple-input
single-output (MU-MISO) system, wherein we formulate a channel fitting problem
aimed at reducing the difference between the FILM-induced and target channels.
Then, we solve this non-convex problem by employing an alternating optimization
(AO) method, featuring closed-form phase shift updates and a gradient
descent-based shape optimization. Furthermore, we analyze the upper bound on
sum-rate and the complexity of computation to provide insights into design
trade-offs. Finally, simulation results demonstrated that the proposed
transmissive FILM architecture achieves over 200\% improvement in sum-rate and
more than 7 dB bit-error rate (BER) gain compared to the conventional
seven-layer SIMs.

Motivation: 研究在任意矩阵A和任意信号x*的情况下，当存在q-稀疏对抗性噪声e时，如何从y=Ax*+e中恢复关于x*的最大信息集。现有方法通常需要强结构假设，而本文关注更一般的情况。

Method: 通过分析所有可能的删除2q行后得到的A的子矩阵的行空间交集，定义投影矩阵U，证明最小化||y-Ax||_0的解位于x*+ker(U)中，并给出构造性恢复方法。

Result: 证明了最佳可恢复集是x*+ker(U)，其中U是投影到所有删除2q行后子矩阵行空间交集的唯一投影矩阵。所有最小化残差ℓ0范数的解都在这个集合中。

Conclusion: 对于任意矩阵A和任意信号x*，在存在q-稀疏对抗性噪声的情况下，x*+ker(U)是能够从观测数据中恢复的包含x*的最小集合，这提供了最大信息量的恢复结果。

Abstract: Let \(\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\) be an arbitrary, known matrix and
\(\bm{e}\) a \(q\)-sparse adversarial vector. Given \(\bm{y} = \bm{A} x^* +
\bm{e}\) and \(q\), we seek the smallest set containing \(x^*\)-hence the one
conveying maximal information about \(x^*\)-that is uniformly recoverable from
\(\bm{y}\) without knowing \(\bm{e}\). While exact recovery of \(x^*\) via
strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on \(\bm{A}\) or \(x^*\)
(for example, restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability
for arbitrary \(\bm{A}\) and \(x^*\) remains open. Our main result shows that
the best that one can hope to recover is \(x^* + \ker(\bm{U})\), where
\(\bm{U}\) is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces
of all possible submatrices of \(\bm{A}\) obtained by deleting \(2q\) rows.
Moreover, we prove that every \(x\) that minimizes the \(\ell\_0\)-norm of
\(\bm{y} - \bm{A} x\) lies in \(x^* + \ker(\bm{U})\), which then gives a
constructive approach to recover this set.

Abstract: Interference management is a central bottleneck in dense multi-antenna
wireless networks. Therefore, in this study, we present a digital
precoding-free hierarchical rate-splitting multiple access (HRSMA) architecture
assisted by a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) to achieve high spectral
efficiency and user fairness with reduced hardware complexity. In the proposed
system, the base station performs only scalar power allocation, while a
multi-layer SIM acts as a wave-domain processor that spatially separates users
and mitigates interference via nonlinear wavefront reconfiguration. This design
eliminates the need for digital or hybrid precoding, drastically reducing the
baseband computations. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize
the minimum user rate by jointly optimizing SIM phase shifts, power allocation,
and user grouping. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex problem, an
alternating optimization algorithm is developed, combining simultaneous
perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) for SIM configuration and power
control with clustering-based grouping refinement. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed SIM-aided HRSMA achieves substantial gains in
both spectral efficiency and fairness compared to hybrid beamforming and
non-precoding baselines. Specifically, SIM-aided HRSMA attains comparable or
superior minimum rates with significantly fewer active antennas by exploiting
the additional wave-domain degrees of freedom provided by multi-layer SIMs.
These findings highlight the potential of SIM-aided HRSMA as a low-cost,
energy-efficient, and scalable solution for beyond-6G networks.

Addressing this challenge, we first utilize dual RISs for user angle estimation
to simplify the solution process of the formulated problem, an efficient
alternating optimization algorithm is then developed. Specifically,
semi-definite relaxation and the bisection method are employed to solve the
transmit beamforming optimization subproblem. For the RIS discrete phase
shifts, a sensing-assisted approach is adopted to constrain the optimization
search space, with two distinct low-complexity search strategies introduced for
different RIS sizes. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves performance close to the ideal continuous phase shift
benchmark, outperforms conventional discrete phase shift optimization
algorithms, and exhibits a significant improvement over single-RIS systems.

Result: 在基于Sionna的真实模拟器上的实验表明，该方法在数据效率上显著提升，对未见环境具有强泛化和适应能力，优于最先进的RL基线。

Conclusion: 双心智世界模型框架通过结合模式识别和逻辑推理，有效解决了无线网络中RL方法的数据效率和泛化问题，为复杂动态网络中的长期规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks,
existing approaches that rely on model-free RL (MFRL) and model-based RL (MBRL)
are data inefficient and short-sighted. Such RL-based solutions cannot
generalize to novel network states since they capture only statistical patterns
rather than the underlying physics and logic from wireless data. These
limitations become particularly challenging in complex wireless networks with
high dynamics and long-term planning requirements. To address these
limitations, in this paper, a novel dual-mind world model-based learning
framework is proposed with the goal of optimizing completeness-weighted age of
information (CAoI) in a challenging mmWave V2X scenario. Inspired by cognitive
psychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven
System 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and
logic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over
reliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end
differentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended
horizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment
interactions. Moreover, through imagination rollouts, the proposed world model
can jointly reason network states and plan link scheduling. During intervals
without observations, the proposed method remains capable of making efficient
decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a realistic simulator based
on Sionna with real-world physical channel, ray-tracing, and scene objects with
material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency and achieves strong
generalization and adaptation to unseen environments, compared to the
state-of-the-art RL baselines, and the world model approach with only System 1.

Abstract: We consider reversely-degraded wiretap channels, for which the secrecy
capacity is zero if there is no channel feedback. This work focuses on a seeded
modular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output
feedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned
feedback-based codes for reliability to achieve positive secrecy rates. We
study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage,
illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between
legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our
findings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication,
to be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods.
