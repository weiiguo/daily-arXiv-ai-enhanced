In real-world scenarios, observed\nsatellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment\nand environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on\nenhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing\nnoise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure,\nleading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces\ntwo key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and\nTemporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization\nfunction that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural\ndetails, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a\nnearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally\nadjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST\nfusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC,\nand develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual\nsplitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs\ncomparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and\noutperforms them under noisy conditions.
