We propose two scheduling variants, sequential check node scheduling (SCNS) and sequential variable node scheduling (SVNS), that improve BP's error-correction ability by processing check nodes (CNs) or variable nodes (VNs), respectively, in a fixed order, stabilizing message updates and reducing stalls. We also employ this technique to an improved BP-variant called BP guided decimation (BPGD), where symbols are progressively fixed during decoding iterations. Here, we demonstrate that the sequential BPGD (SBPGD) decoder can further improve the convergence properties and performance of the decoder. On standard QLDPC benchmarks under a Pauli-X noise model, our sequential schedules are shown to lower the block error rate relative to conventional BP, and SBPGD outperforms BPGD while using significantly fewer decimation rounds, translating to lower computational cost. These results demonstrate that changing the update schedule, without altering the code, can improve both the reliability and efficiency of BP-based decoding for QLDPC codes. For the [[1922,50,16]] C2 hypergraph-product code with independent X errors, SVNS-BP surpasses BP-OSD-0 in error correction at roughly the same complexity as standard BP."}

While existing works either assume additive white Gaussian noise channels or treat fading channels without a fully end-to-end learning approach, our framework directly embeds the wireless channel into both training and inference. To account for practical channel state information (CSI), we further incorporate limited feedback via both uniform and Lloyd-Max quantization of channel gains and analyze their impact on AE training and bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that, with perfect CSI, the proposed AE outperforms the existing analytical NOMA schemes. In addition, Lloyd-Max quantization achieves superior BER performance compared to uniform quantization.

Thus, in this work, we investigate an SIM-assisted secure communication system for MUs under the threat of an eavesdropper, addressing practical challenges such as channel uncertainty in mobile environments, multiple MU interference, and residual hardware impairments.

Instead of using a separate smoothing step, we propose to integrate the decoding and smoothing components into a single probabilistic framework using a Markov switching model (MSM).

This paper studies the UAV swarm enabled near-field AMA communication, by taking into account the non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) model, where UAV swarm trajectory simultaneously influences the channel amplitude and phase. We formulate a general optimization problem to maximize the minimum average communication rate over user equipments (UEs), by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV swarm trajectory and receive beamforming for all UEs. To draw useful insights, the special case of single UE is first studied, and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is proposed to efficiently optimize the UAV swarm trajectory. For the special case of placement optimization, the optimal placement positions of UAVs for cases of single UAV and two UAVs are derived in closed-form. Then, for the special case of two UEs, we show that an inter-UE interference (IUI)-free communication can be achieved by symmetrically placing an even number of UAVs along a hyperbola, with its foci corresponding to the locations of the two UEs. Furthermore, for arbitrary number of UEs, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to efficiently tackle the non-convex optimization problem.

One of the key challenges is to effectively represent and extract the semantic meaning of any given source signals. While deep learning (DL)-based solutions have shown promising results in extracting implicit semantic information from a wide range of sources, existing work often overlooks the high computational complexity inherent in both model training and inference for the DL-based encoder and decoder. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) framework which extends the classical rate-distortion theory by incorporating the constraints on semantic distance, including both the traditional bit-wise distortion metric and statistical difference-based divergence metric, and complexity measure, adopted from the theory of minimum description length and information bottleneck. We derive the closed-form theoretical results of the minimum achievable rate under given constraints on semantic distance and complexity for both Gaussian and binary semantic sources. Our theoretical results show a fundamental three-way tradeoff among achievable rate, semantic distance, and model complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world image and video datasets validate this tradeoff and further demonstrate that our information-theoretic complexity measure effectively correlates with practical computational costs, guiding efficient system design in resource-constrained scenarios."}

However, the large XL-IRS aperture induces spherical wavefront propagation due to near-field (NF) effects, complicating cascaded channel estimation. Conventional dictionary-based methods suffer from cumulative quantization errors and high complexity, especially in uniform planar array (UPA) systems. To address these issues, we first propose a tensor modelization method for NF cascaded channels by exploiting the tensor product among the horizontal and vertical response vectors of the UPA-structured base station (BS) and the incident-reflective array response vector of the IRS. This structure leverages spatial characteristics, enabling independent estimation of factor matrices to improve efficiency. Meanwhile, to avoid quantization errors, we propose an off-grid cascaded channel estimation framework based on sparse Tucker decomposition. Specifically, we model the received signal as a Tucker tensor, where the sparse core tensor captures path gain-delay terms and three factor matrices are spanned by BS and NF IRS array responses. We then formulate a sparse core tensor minimization problem with tri-modal log-sum sparsity constraints to tackle the NP-hard challenge. Finally, the method is accelerated via higher-order singular value decomposition preprocessing, combined with majorization-minimization and a tailored tensor over-relaxation fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding technique.

This paper proposes a lightweight, non-visual image-based method for robust quasi-static human presence detection using a low-cost 60 GHz FMCW radar. On a dataset covering five semi-static activities, the proposed method improves average detection accuracy from 68.3% for Cell-Averaging CFAR (CA-CFAR) and 78.8% for Order-Statistics CFAR (OS-CFAR) to 93.24% for Subject 1, from 51.3%, 68.3% to 92.3% for Subject 2, and 57.72%, 69.94% to 94.82% for Subject 3, respectively. Finally, we benchmarked all three detectors across all activities on a Raspberry Pi 4B using a shared Range-Angle (RA) preprocessing pipeline. The proposed algorithm obtains an average 8.2 ms per frame, resulting in over 120 frames per second (FPS) and a 74 times speed-up over OS-CFAR.

We analyze both scalar and vectorial frameworks, employing Bent and s-Plateaued functions, including Almost Bent, to define the code generators. By exploiting the properties of the Walsh transform, we determine the explicit parameters and weight distributions of these codes and their punctured versions. A key result of this study is that the constructed codes have few weights, and their duals are distance and dimensionally optimal with respect to both the Sphere Packing and Griesmer bounds.

This paper revisits its sensing potential and presents WiRSSI, a bistatic WiFi sensing framework for passive human tracking using only RSSI measurements. WiRSSI adopts a 1Tx-3Rx configuration and is readily extensible to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) deployments. We first reveal how CSI power implicitly encodes phase-related information and how this relationship carries over to RSSI, showing that RSSI preserves exploitable Doppler, Angle-of-Arrival (AoA), and delay cues associated with human motion. WiRSSI then extracts Doppler-AoA features via a 2D Fast Fourier Transform and infers delay from amplitude-only information in the absence of subcarrier-level phase. The estimated AoA and delay are then mapped to Cartesian coordinates and denoised to recover motion trajectories. Experiments in practical environments show that WiRSSI achieves median XY localization errors of 0.905 m, 0.784 m, and 0.785 m for elliptical, linear, and rectangular trajectories, respectively. In comparison, a representative CSI-based method attains median errors of 0.574 m, 0.599 m, and 0.514 m, corresponding to an average accuracy gap of 0.26 m.

We propose an extended universal JSCC (euJSCC) framework that achieves SNR- and modulation-adaptive transmission within a single model. euJSCC employs a hypernetwork-based normalization layer for fine-grained feature vector normalization and a dynamic codebook generation (DCG) network that refines modulation-specific base codebooks according to block-wise SNR. To handle block fading channels, which consist of multiple coherence blocks, an inner-outer encoder-decoder architecture is adopted, where the outer encoder and decoder capture long-term channel statistics, and the inner encoder and decoder refine feature vectors to align with block-wise codebooks. A two-phase training strategy, i.e., pretraining on AWGN channels followed by finetuning on block fading channels, ensures stable convergence. Experiments on image transmission demonstrate that euJSCC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art channel-adaptive digital JSCC schemes under both block fading and AWGN channels."}

The relevance of this question spans from hybrid-MIMO analog combiners via computational meta-imagers to programmable wave-domain signal processing. Yet, no electromagnetically consistent bounds have been derived for the fidelity with which a desired operator can be realized in a real-world reconfigurable wave system. Here, we derive such bounds based on an electromagnetically consistent multiport-network model (capturing mutual coupling between tunable elements) and accounting for real-world hardware constraints (lossy, 1-bit-programmable elements). Specifically, we formulate the operator-synthesis task as a quadratically constrained fractional-quadratic problem and compute rigorous fidelity upper bounds based on semidefinite relaxation. We apply our technique to three distinct experimental setups. The first two setups are, respectively, a free-space and a rich-scattering $4\\times 4$ MIMO channel at 2.45 GHz parameterized by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) comprising 100 1-bit-programmable elements. The third setup is a $4\\times 4$ MIMO channel at 19 GHz from four feeds of a dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) to four users. We systematically study how the achievable fidelity scales with the number of tunable elements, and we probe the tightness of our bounds by trying to find optimized configurations approaching the bounds with standard discrete-optimization techniques. We observe a strong influence of the coupling strength between tunable elements on our fidelity bound. For the two RIS-based setups, our bound attests to insufficient wave-domain flexibility for the considered operator synthesis."}

A UAV-mounted RIS provides blockage mitigation and passive beamforming, while the base station employs zero-forcing precoding for multiuser interference suppression. Due to limited feedback from UEHRs, their channel state information (CSI) is imperfect, leading to a worst-case secrecy energy efficiency (WCSEE) maximization problem. We jointly optimize the UAV horizontal position, RIS phase shifts, and transmit power allocation under both perfect and imperfect CSI, considering discrete RIS phases, UAV mobility, and energy-harvesting constraints. The resulting problem is highly nonconvex due to coupled channel geometry, robustness requirements, and discrete variables. To address this challenge, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning framework that learns WCSEE-maximizing policies through interaction with the wireless environment. As a structured benchmark, a successive convex approximation (SCA) approach is developed for the perfect CSI case with continuous RIS phases.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cost-effective PLS design for IRS-assisted mMIMO systems by employing one-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The focus is on jointly optimizing one-bit quantized precoding at the transmitter and constant-modulus phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate.

Simulations for a low Earth orbit satellite at 600 km orbit and two UE devices performing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based transmission with polar coding at 3.5 GHz demonstrate block error rates below 0.1 with transmission powers as low as -10 dBm, even under strong interference when UE devices are resolved but fall on each other's strongest angular sidelobe. These results validate the ability of the proposed scheme to address mutual interference and stringent power limitations, paving the way for massive Internet of Things connectivity in non-terrestrial networks."}

However, radio-frequency (RF) signals, which underpin wireless systems, are still not natively supported by these models. Existing LLM-based approaches for telecom focus mainly on text and structured data, while conventional RF deep-learning models are built separately for specific signal-processing tasks, highlighting a clear gap between RF perception and high-level reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce RF-GPT, a radio-frequency language model (RFLM) that utilizes the visual encoders of multimodal LLMs to process and understand RF spectrograms. In this framework, complex in-phase/quadrature (IQ) waveforms are mapped to time-frequency spectrograms and then passed to pretrained visual encoders. The resulting representations are injected as RF tokens into a decoder-only LLM, which generates RF-grounded answers, explanations, and structured outputs. To train RF-GPT, we perform supervised instruction fine-tuning of a pretrained multimodal LLM using a fully synthetic RF corpus. Standards-compliant waveform generators produce wideband scenes for six wireless technologies, from which we derive time-frequency spectrograms, exact configuration metadata, and dense captions. A text-only LLM then converts these captions into RF-grounded instruction-answer pairs, yielding roughly 12,000 RF scenes and 0.625 million instruction examples without any manual labeling. Across benchmarks for wideband modulation classification, overlap analysis, wireless-technology recognition, WLAN user counting, and 5G NR information extraction, RF-GPT achieves strong multi-task performance, whereas general-purpose VLMs with no RF grounding largely fail."}

Two filter implementations, namely direct lattice and layout-balanced lattice topologies, are designed and fabricated in periodically poled piezoelectric film (P3F) thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). By leveraging the strong electromechanical coupling of XBARs in P3F TFLN together with the inherently wideband nature of the lattice topology, 3-dB fractional bandwidths (FBWs) of 27.42\\% and 39.11\\% and low insertion losses (ILs) of 0.88 dB and 0.96 dB are achieved at approximately 20 GHz for the direct and layout-balanced lattice filters, respectively, under conjugate matching. Notably, all prototypes feature compact footprints smaller than 1.3 mm\\textsuperscript{2}. These results highlight the potential of XBAR-based lattice architectures to enable low-loss, wideband acoustic filters for compact, high-performance RF front ends in next-generation wireless communication and sensing systems, while also identifying key challenges and directions for further optimization."}

Eggleston"], "title": "Real-time Range-Angle Estimation and Tag Localization for Multi-static Backscatter Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Multi-static backscatter networks (BNs) are strong candidates for joint communication and localization in the ambient IoT paradigm for 6G. Enabling real-time localization in large-scale multi-static deployments with thousands of devices require highly efficient algorithms for estimating key parameters such as range and angle of arrival (AoA), and for fusing these parameters into location estimates. We propose two low-complexity algorithms, Joint Range-Angle Clustering (JRAC) and Stage-wise Range-Angle Estimation (SRAE). Both deliver range and angle estimation accuracy comparable to FFT- and subspace-based baselines while significantly reducing the computation. We then introduce two real-time localization algorithms that fuse the estimated ranges and AoAs: a maximum-likelihood (ML) method solved via gradient search and an iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) method. Both achieve localization accuracy comparable to ML-based brute force search albeit with far lower complexity. Experiments on a real-world large-scale multi-static testbed with 4 illuminators, 1 multi-antenna receiver, and 100 tags show that JRAC and SRAE reduce runtime by up to 40X and IRLS achieves up to 500X reduction over ML-based brute force search without degrading localization accuracy. The proposed methods achieve 3 m median localization error across all 100 tags in a sub-6GHz band with 40 MHz bandwidth. These results demonstrate that multi-static range-angle estimation and localization algorithms can make real-time, scalable backscatter localization practical for next-generation ambient IoT networks."}

While existing works either assume additive white Gaussian noise channels or treat fading channels without a fully end-to-end learning approach, our framework directly embeds the wireless channel into both training and inference. To account for practical channel state information (CSI), we further incorporate limited feedback via both uniform and Lloyd-Max quantization of channel gains and analyze their impact on AE training and bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that, with perfect CSI, the proposed AE outperforms the existing analytical NOMA schemes. In addition, Lloyd-Max quantization achieves superior BER performance compared to uniform quantization. These results demonstrate that end-to-end AEs trained directly over Rayleigh fading can effectively learn robust, interference-aware signaling strategies, paving the way for NOMA deployment in fading environments with realistic CSI constraints."}

Discernment dynamically adapts to channel impairments - modeled as erasure channels - by switching between an autoregressive or a diffusion-based generative algorithm, depending on the erasure pattern. Our results show that Discernment maintains semantic integrity even as channel capacity severely degrades, exhibiting very small and graceful performance decline in both classification accuracy and statistical fidelity of the reconstructed meaning. These findings demonstrate Discernment's ability to adjust to diverse physical channel conditions while maintaining spectral efficiency and low model complexity, making it well suited for IoT deployments and strongly motivating further research on this semantic channel paradigm."}

These systems are implemented by attaching low-cost pinching elements to dielectric waveguides. As the direct link is bypassed through waveguides, PASSs can effectively compensate large-scale effects of the wireless channel. This work explores the potential gains of employing PASSs for over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL). For a PASS-assisted server, we develop a low-complexity algorithmic approach, which jointly tunes the PASS parameters and schedules the mobile devices for minimal energy consumption in OTA-FL. We study the efficiency of the proposed design and compare it against the conventional OTA-FL setting with MIMO server. Numerical experiments demonstrate that using a single-waveguide PASS at the server within a moderately sized area, the required energy for model aggregation is drastically reduced as compared to the case with fully-digital MIMO server. This introduces PASS as a potential technology for energy-efficient distributed learning in next generations of wireless systems."}
