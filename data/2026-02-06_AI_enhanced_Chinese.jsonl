In almost all instances, deletions are assumed to be imposed independently of each other and of the sequence context. These assumptions are not valid in practice, since nanopore errors tend to occur within specific contexts. We study contextual nanopore deletion-errors through the example setting of deterministic single deletions following (complete) runlengths of length at least $k$. The model critically depends on the runlength threshold $k$, and we examine two regimes for $k$: a) $k=C\\log n$ for a constant $C\\in(0,1)$; in this case, we study error-correcting codes that can protect from a constant number $t$ of contextual deletions, and show that the minimum redundancy (ignoring lower-order terms) is between $(1-C)t\\log n$ and $2(1-C)t\\log n$, meaning that it is a ($1-C$)-fraction of that of arbitrary $t$-deletion-correcting codes. To complement our non-constructive redundancy upper bound, we design efficiently and encodable and decodable codes for any constant $t$. In particular, for $t=1$ and $C>1/2$ we construct efficient codes with redundancy that essentially matches our non-constructive upper bound; b) $k$ equal a constant; in this case we consider the extremal problem where the number of deletions is not bounded and a deletion is imposed after every run of length at least $k$, which we call the extremal contextual deletion channel. This combinatorial setting arises naturally by considering a probabilistic channel that introduces contextual deletions after each run of length at least $k$ with probability $p$ and taking the limit $p\\to 1$. We obtain sharp bounds on the maximum achievable rate under the extremal contextual deletion channel for arbitrary constant $k$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u6d4b\u5e8f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u5220\u9664\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u8fd0\u884c\u957f\u5ea6\u9608\u503ck\u4e0b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u5f53k=Clogn\u65f6\u6784\u9020\u9ad8\u6548\u7ea0\u5220\u7801\uff1b\u5f53k\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u7aef\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5220\u9664\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u8fbe\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "DNA\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u6d4b\u5e8f\u5668\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5220\u9664\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5220\u9664\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9519\u8bef\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u5220\u9664\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5355\u5220\u9664\u8ddf\u968f\u957f\u5ea6\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3ak\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6e38\u7a0b\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cdk\u503c\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a1) k=Clogn\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u9632\u62a4t\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5220\u9664\u7684\u7ea0\u5220\u7801\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\uff1b2) k\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u7aef\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5220\u9664\u4fe1\u9053\uff08\u6bcf\u6b21\u957f\u5ea6\u2265k\u7684\u6e38\u7a0b\u540e\u90fd\u53d1\u751f\u5220\u9664\uff09\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u8fbe\u7387\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8ek=Clogn\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a\u6700\u5c0f\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u5728(1-C)tlog n\u548c2(1-C)tlog n\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u662f\u4efb\u610ft-\u5220\u9664\u7ea0\u6b63\u7801\u7684(1-C)\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662ft=1\u4e14C>1/2\u65f6\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u57fa\u672c\u5339\u914d\u975e\u6784\u9020\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8ek\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6781\u7aef\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5220\u9664\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u8fbe\u7387\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u5220\u9664\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u72ec\u7acb\u5220\u9664\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8fd0\u884c\u957f\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aDNA\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, traditional frequency-domain channel sounding methods suffer from low efficiency due to a prohibitive number of frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\\times$ faster measurement, a 98\\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u4fe1\u9053\u63a2\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548cLR-SAGE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b050\u500d\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u548c99.96%\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e3a6G AI-native\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ISAC\u6570\u636e\u96c6", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b06G\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u4fe1\u613f\u666f\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u9053\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u907f\u514d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u7cca\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9891\u70b9\u800c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u9891\u7387\u91c7\u6837(PFS)\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u9891\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f3c\u7136\u6821\u6b63\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\u5e7f\u4e49\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316(LR-SAGE)\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5f84\u5206\u91cf", "result": "\u5728280-300GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b050\u500d\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u300198%\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u548c99.96%\u540e\u5904\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8be6\u5c3d\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u5f84\u5206\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u7279\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efaAI-native 6G\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ISAC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u4f7f\u80fd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528AI\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b"}}

The sum-rank metric found its application in network coding, locally repairable codes, space-time coding, and quantum-resistant cryptography. Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes are the sum-rank analogue of Reed-Solomon codes and strictly generalize both Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes.\n  In this work, we construct an explicit family of $\\mathbb{F}_h$-linear sum-rank metric codes over arbitrary fields $\\mathbb{F}_h$. Our construction enables efficient list decoding up to a fraction $\u03c1$ of errors in the sum-rank metric with rate $1-\u03c1-\\varepsilon$, for any desired $\u03c1\\in (0,1)$ and $\\varepsilon>0$. Our codes are subcodes of LRS codes, obtained by restricting message polynomials to an $\\mathbb{F}_h$-subspace derived from subspace designs, and the decoding list size is bounded by $h^{\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)}$.\n  Beyond the standard LRS setting, we further extend our linear-algebraic decoding framework to folded Linearized Reed-Solomon (FLRS) codes. We show that folded evaluations satisfy appropriate interpolation conditions and that the corresponding solution space forms a low-dimensional, structured affine subspace. This structure enables effective control of the list size and yields the first explicit positive-rate FLRS subcodes that are efficiently list decodable beyond the unique-decoding radius.

To reduce the computational complexity of existing sampling-based optimization methods, we propose a new low-complexity yet efficient beam coverage design. To this end, we first formulate a general beam coverage optimization problem to maximize the worst-case beamforming gain over a target region. For the far-field case, we show that the beam coverage design can be viewed as a spatial-frequency filtering problem, where angular coverage can be achieved by weight-shaping in the antenna domain via an inverse FT, yielding an infinite-length weighting sequence. Under the constraint of a finite number of antennas, a surrogate scheme is proposed by directly truncating this sequence, which inevitably introduces a roll-off effect at the angular boundaries, yielding degraded worst-case beamforming gain. To address this issue, we characterize the finite-antenna-induced roll-off effect, based on which a roll-off-aware design with a protective zoom is developed to ensure a flat beamforming-gain profile within the target angular region. Next, we extend the proposed method to the near-field case. Specifically, by applying a first-order Taylor approximation to the near-field channel steering vector (CSV), the two-dimensional (2D) beam coverage design (in both angle and inverse-range) can be transformed into a 2D inverse FT, leading to a low-complexity beamforming design. Furthermore, an inherent near-field range defocusing effect is observed, indicating that sufficiently wide angular coverage results in range-insensitive beam steering. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FT-based approach achieves a comparable worst-case beamforming performance with that of conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing the computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdc\u573a\u548c\u8fd1\u573a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u5c06\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u6ee4\u6ce2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u5929\u7ebf\u57df\u6743\u91cd\u6574\u5f62\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u6eda\u964d\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u4fdd\u62a4\u653e\u5927\u7684\u6eda\u964d\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fd1\u573a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u6cf0\u52d2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5c06\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u9006\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FT-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8fd1\u573a\u8303\u56f4\u6563\u7126\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8db3\u591f\u5bbd\u7684\u89d2\u8986\u76d6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8303\u56f4\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u5bfc\u5411", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdc\u573a\u548c\u8fd1\u573a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

A key challenge here is to jointly guarantee tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability within a unified framework. To address this issue, we propose an integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) framework for UAV-assisted target tracking, where the considered tracking system is modeled as a discrete-time linear control process, with the objective of driving the deviation between the UAV and target states toward zero. We formulate a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) optimization problem for joint control and beamforming design, which is highly non-convex and intractable in its original form. To overcome this difficulty, the target state is first estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, by deriving the closed-form optimal beamforming solution under a given control input, the original problem is equivalently reformulated into a tractable control-oriented form. Finally, we convexify the remaining non-convex constraints via a relaxation-based convex approximation, yielding a computationally tractable convex optimization problem that admits efficient global solution.

However, accurately reconstructing both the shape and permittivity of the defects inside cylindrical structures remains challenging due to complex wave scattering phenomena and the limited accuracy of the existing signal processing and deep learning techniques. To address these issues, this study proposes a migration-assisted deep learning scheme for reconstructing the shape and permittivity of defects within cylindrical structures. The proposed scheme involves three stages of GPR data processing. First, a dual-permittivity estimation network extracts the permittivity values of the defect and the cylindrical structure, the latter of which is estimated with the help of a novel structural similarity index measure-based autofocusing technique. Second, a modified Kirchhoff migration incorporating the extracted permittivity of the cylindrical structure maps the signals reflected from the defect to the imaging domain. Third, a shape reconstruction network processes the migrated image to recover the precise shape of the defect. The image of the interior defect is finally obtained by combining the reconstructed shape and extracted permittivity of the defect. The proposed scheme is validated using both synthetic and experimental data from a laboratory trunk model and real tree trunk samples. Comparative results show superior performance over existing deep learning methods, while generalization tests on live trees confirm its feasibility for in-field deployment. The underlying principle can further be applied to other circumferential GPR imaging scenarios.

In the proposed UCSFL framework, users deploy split sub-models locally, while complete models are maintained and updated at access point (AP)-side distributed processing units (DPUs), followed by a two-level aggregation procedure across DPUs and the central processing unit (CPU). Under standard machine learning (ML) assumptions, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for UCSFL, which reveals that the AP-cluster size is a key factor influencing model training accuracy. Motivated by this result, we introduce a new performance metric, termed the latency-to-accuracy ratio, defined as the ratio of a user's per-iteration training latency to the weighted size of its AP cluster. Based on this metric, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the maximum latency-to-accuracy ratio by jointly optimizing uplink power control, downlink beamforming, model splitting, and AP clustering. The resulting problem is decomposed into two sub-problems operating on different time scales, for which dedicated algorithms are developed to handle the short-term and long-term optimizations, respectively. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that UCSFL effectively reduces the latency-to-accuracy ratio of the VGG16 model compared with baseline schemes. Moreover, the proposed framework adaptively adjusts splitting and clustering strategies in response to varying communication and computation resources. An MNIST-based handwritten digit classification example further shows that UCSFL significantly accelerates the convergence of the VGG16 model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5206\u5272\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65e0\u5c0f\u533aMIMO\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\u548cAP\u805a\u7c7b\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4", "motivation": "\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65e0\u5c0f\u533aMIMO\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5272\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUCSFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5206\u5272\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0cAP\u4fa7DPU\u7ef4\u62a4\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u7ea7\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0AP\u7c07\u5927\u5c0f\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0cUCSFL\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86VGG16\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u5272\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\uff1bMNIST\u624b\u5199\u6570\u5b57\u5206\u7c7b\u793a\u4f8b\u663e\u793aUCSFL\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fVGG16\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b", "conclusion": "UCSFL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65e0\u5c0f\u533aMIMO\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027"}}

Dependence of the codebook on statistics of $X$, however, is highly impractical. This paper proves that there exist a universal codebook that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible statistics of $X$, in the sense of being at least as good as an $X$-adapted waterfilling codebook with rate reduced by 0.11 bit per dimension.

This paper explores novel neural network (NN) architectures suitable for trajectory estimation and path determination in a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) outdoor system based on localization data from beamformed fingerprint (BFF). The NN architecture captures sequences of BFF signals from different users, and through the application of learning mechanisms, subsequently estimate their trajectories. In turn, this information is employed to find the shortest path to the target, thereby enabling more efficient navigation. Specifically, we propose a two-stage procedure for trajectory estimation and optimal path finding. In the first stage, a transformer network (TN) based on attention mechanisms is developed to predict trajectories of wireless devices using BFF sequences captured in a mmWave MIMO outdoor system. In the second stage, a novel algorithm based on Informed Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (iRRT*) is employed to determine the optimal path to target locations using trajectory estimates derived in the first stage. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through numerical experiments, using a comprehensive dataset of radio measurements, generated using ray tracing simulations to model outdoor propagation at 28 GHz. We show that our proposed TN-based trajectory estimator outperforms other methods from the recent literature and can successfully generalize to new trajectories outside the training set. Furthermore, our proposed iRRT* algorithm is able to consistently provide the shortest path to the target.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684Transformer\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6307\u7eb9\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5907\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684iRRT*\u7b97\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4f20\u8f93\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba4\u5916\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bbe\u5907\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684Transformer\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6307\u7eb9\u5e8f\u5217\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5907\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Informed RRT*\u7b97\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u4f7f\u752828GHz\u7684\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4eff\u771f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "Transformer\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5916\u7684\u65b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684iRRT*\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u63d0\u4f9b\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u5ba4\u5916\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u822a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The orthogonality constrained modal search based depth estimation (OCMS-D) method is proposed in this paper, which enables the estimation of the depth of a monoharmonic source at a fixed range using a VLA under unknown seabed parameters. Using the sparsity of propagating normal modes and the orthogonality of mode depth functions, OCMS-D estimates the normal mode parameters under a fixed source-array distance at first. The estimated normal mode parameters are then used to estimate the source depth. To ensure the precision of the source depth estimation, the method utilizes information on both the amplitude distribution and the sign (positive/negative) patterns of the estimated mode depth functions at the inferred source depth. Numerical simulations evaluate the performance of OCMS-D under different conditions. The effectiveness of OCMS-D is also verified by the Yellow Sea experiment and the SWellEx-96 experiment. In the Yellow Sea experiment, the depth estimation absolute errors by OCMS-D with a 4-second time window are less than 2.4 m.

While radio maps enable proactive mode selection, reconstructing high-fidelity maps from sparse measurements is challenging. Existing physics-agnostic or data-driven methods often fail to recover fine-grained shadowing details under extreme sparsity. We propose a Physics-Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Completion (PR-LRTC) framework for radio map reconstruction. By modeling the signal field as a three-way tensor, we integrate environmental low-rankness with deterministic antenna physics. Specifically, we leverage Effective Aerial Degrees-of-Freedom (EADoF) theory to derive a differential gain topology map as a physical prior for regularization. The resulting optimization problem is solved via an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm.

Our aim is to sense a remote target shape with the collected signals which consist of both the reflection and scattering signals. We first characterize the mmWave's scattering and reflection effects based on the Lambertian scattering model. Then we apply the periodogram technique to obtain rough scattering point detection, and further incorporate the subspace method to achieve more precise scattering and reflection point detection. Based on these, a reconstruction algorithm based on Hough Transform and principal component analysis (PCA) is designed for a single convex polygon target scenario.

Such systematic errors typically arise from sensor mis-calibration, including uncertainties in sensor positions and response characteristics, leading to measurement-induced phase shifts in plane wave coefficients. Traditional methods often result in biased estimates or non-convex solutions. To overcome these issues, we propose an optimal transport (OT) framework. This framework operates on a set of lifted non-negative measures that correspond to observation-dependent shifted coefficients relative to the unperturbed ones. By applying OT, the supports of the measures are transported toward an optimal average in the phase space, effectively morphing them into an indistinguishable state. This optimal average, known as barycenter, is linked to the estimated plane-wave coefficients using the same lifting rule. The framework addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem, due to the large number of plane waves, by adding a constant to the ground cost, ensuring the sparsity of the transport matrix. Convex consistency of the solution is maintained. Simulation results confirm that our proposed method provides more accurate coefficient estimations compared to baseline approaches in scenarios with both additive noise and phase perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93(OT)\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u58f0\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6807\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6270\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u7cfb\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u58f0\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6807\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u975e\u51f8\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u7cfb\u6570\u51fa\u73b0\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93(OT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u7cfb\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u975e\u8d1f\u6d4b\u5ea6\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7OT\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u652f\u6491\u96c6\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u76f8\u4f4d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff08\u91cd\u5fc3\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b83\u4eec\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u91cd\u5fc3\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u7cfb\u6570\u5173\u8054\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u6570\u91cf\u591a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6210\u672c\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u5e38\u6570\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4f20\u8f93\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u52a0\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u7684\u51f8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u58f0\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6270\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u7cfb\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6d4b\u5ea6\u5e76\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u91cd\u5fc3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper proposes Intensity- and Distance-Aware Statistical Outlier Removal (IDSOR), a range-adaptive filtering method that jointly exploits intensity cues and neighborhood sparsity. By incorporating an empirical, range-dependent distribution of weather returns into the threshold design, IDSOR suppresses weather-induced points while preserving fine structural details without cumbersome manual parameter tuning. We also propose a variant that uses a previously proposed method to estimate the weather return distribution from data, and integrates it into IDSOR. Experiments on simulation-augmented level-crossing measurements and on the Winter Adverse Driving dataset (WADS) demonstrate that IDSOR achieves a favorable precision-recall trade-off, maintaining both precision and recall above 90% on WADS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIDSOR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u6ee4\u96e8\u96ea\u5929\u6c14\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684LiDAR\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u7e41\u7410\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18", "motivation": "\u96e8\u96ea\u5929\u6c14\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u5929\u6c14\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5ea6-\u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u7edf\u8ba1\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u53bb\u9664(IDSOR)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u5929\u6c14\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u9608\u503c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5929\u6c14\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\uff1b\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5929\u6c14\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230IDSOR\u4e2d", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u4ea4\u53c9\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u51ac\u5b63\u6076\u52a3\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6(WADS)\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIDSOR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387-\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728WADS\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5747\u8d85\u8fc790%", "conclusion": "IDSOR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96e8\u96ea\u5929\u6c14LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6291\u5236\u5929\u6c14\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7e41\u7410\u624b\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18"}}
