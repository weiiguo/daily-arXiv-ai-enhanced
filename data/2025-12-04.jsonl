This paper proposes an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) MIMO framework that uses Reconfigurable Pixel Antenna (RPixA), which introduces additional EM-domain DoF that are electronically controlled through binary antenna coder switch networks. We introduce a beamforming architecture combining this EM and digital precoding to jointly optimize Sensing and Communication. Based on full-wave simulation of pixel antenna, we formulate a non-convex joint optimization problem to maximize sensing rate under user-specific constraints on communication rate. We utilize an Alternating Optimization framework incorporating genetic algorithm for port states of Pixel antennas, and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) for digital beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed EM-aware design achieves considerably higher sensing rate compared to conventional arrays and enables considerable antenna reduction for equivalent ISAC performance. These findings highlight the potential of reconfigurable pixel antennas to realize efficient and scalable EM-aware ISAC systems for future 6G networks."}

In this study, we present a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset collected from trained musicians as they imagined and listened to musical and poetic stimuli. We show that both imagined and perceived brain responses contain consistent, condition-specific information. Using a sliding-window ridge regression model, we first mapped imagined responses to listened responses at the single-subject level, but found limited generalization across subjects. At the group level, we developed an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with a subject-specific calibration layer that produced stable and generalizable mappings. The CNN consistently outperformed the null model, yielding significantly higher correlations between predicted and true listened responses for nearly all held-out subjects. Our findings demonstrate that imagined neural activity can be transformed into perception-like responses, providing a foundation for future brain-computer interface applications involving imagined speech and music."}

A novel PASS-based multi-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework is proposed by exploiting the waveguide-division (WD) transmission characteristic. Specifically, each NOMA user cluster is served by one dedicated waveguide, and the corresponding pinching beamforming is exploited to enhance the intra-cluster performance while mitigating the inter-cluster interference. Based on this framework, a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing power allocation, pinching beamforming, and user scheduling. To solve this problem, a two-step algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems. For the joint power allocation and pinching beamforming design, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm is proposed to obtain the locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the coupling constraints are alleviated through augmented Lagrangian relaxation, and the resulting augmented Lagrangian (AL) problem is decomposed into four subproblems, which are solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. For the user scheduling, a low-complexity matching algorithm is developed to solve the user-to-waveguide assignment problem. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) the proposed PASS-based NOMA framework under the WD transmission structure achieves significant sum-rate gain over conventional fixed-position antenna systems and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme; and 2) the proposed matching-based user scheduling algorithm achieves near-optimal user-waveguide association with low computational complexity."}

Channel measurement and modeling is a prerequisite for ISAC system design and has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. 3GPP Release 19 initiated the ISAC channel study item in December 2023 and finalized its modeling specification in May 2025 after extensive technical discussions. However, a comprehensive survey that provides a systematic overview,from empirical channel features to modeling methodologies and standardized simulators,remains unavailable. In this paper, the key requirements and challenges in ISAC channel research are first analyzed, followed by a structured overview of the standardization workflow throughout the 3GPP Release 19 process. Then, critical aspects of ISAC channels, including physical objects, target channels, and background channels, are examined in depth, together with additional features such as spatial consistency, environment objects, Doppler characteristics, and shared clusters, supported by measurement-based analysis. To establish a unified ISAC channel modeling framework, an Extended Geometry-based Stochastic Model (E-GBSM) is proposed, incorporating all the aforementioned ISAC channel characteristics. Finally, a standardized simulator is developed based on E-GBSM, and a two-phase calibration procedure aligned with 3GPP Release 19 is conducted to validate both the model and the simulator, demonstrating close agreement with industrial reference results. Overall, this paper provides a systematic survey of 3GPP Release 19 ISAC channel standardization and offers insights into best practices for new feature characterization, unified modeling methodology, and standardized simulator implementation, which can effectively supporting ISAC technology evaluation and future 6G standardization."}

Although prior studies have examined PRACH detection, they are often restricted to specific scenarios or lack a comprehensive analytical characterization of performance. We introduce a unified analytical framework that characterizes the statistical distribution of the received power delay profile (PDP) under flat Rayleigh fading and supports both coherent combining (CC) and power combining (PC) repetition strategies. For each strategy, we derive optimal threshold expressions and closed-form detection probabilities. Furthermore, we analyze two key cases depending on the coherence time: identical and independent channel realizations per repetition. Secondly, we exploit the correlation induced by CFO across cyclic shifts to design a novel low-complexity detector that exploits PDP dependencies. Numerical results indicate that PC outperforms CC when repetitions experience independent channels, while CC can be preferable under identical realizations in limited settings. On the other hand, the proposed CFO-aware detector delivers improved robustness under severe CFO conditions."}

The concept of FAS has emerged as an attractive new technology for use in sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems, but most implementations of FAS rely on mechanically reconfigurable antennas which are hindered by inertia, and are therefore too slow to be useful. Using the insight that changing an antenna's physical position is equivalent to switching the excitation current vector of a multi-port antenna, a novel beamformer is proposed with a scalable methodology for incorporating into FAS to form a PRBFN-FAS. Key novelties in creating the PRBFN include selecting the required current vectors and concatenating beamforming networks together to form the desired PRBFN. Two PRBFN-FAS design examples are demonstrated with FAS equivalent physical movements of 0.5 and 1.5 wavelengths. Measurements demonstrate that the PRBFN-FAS provides good matching and Bessel correlation across the desired bandwidth, satisfying FAS requirements. System-level experiments confirm the viability of PRBFN-FAS in practical communication scenarios."}

In dynamic scenes, Doppler shifts degrade both sensing and communication, which is particularly critical for beam-sensitive orbital angular momentum (OAM) wavefronts. To address this, we propose a Doppler-robust ISAC framework, which first senses and then communicates. Specifically, in the sensing phase, multiple vortex modes are simultaneously transmitted via code-division mode-multiplexing (CDMM). To solve Doppler-induced inter-mode interference, we propose a velocity-consistency matching (VCM)-expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that jointly decodes the sensing matrix and estimates range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity for multiple moving targets. In the communication phase, the joint transmitter (Tx) beamforming and receiver (Rx) beam steering are configured from the estimated channel state information (CSI). We further quantify the sensing-communication allocation trade-off by evaluating how pilot length affects estimation accuracy, beam alignment, and spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that the proposed VCM-EM and ISAC designs achieve higher sensing accuracy and communication SE than baseline schemes in dynamic scenarios."}

The system has a capacity of one packet, i.e., no waiting buffer, and is modeled as a multi-source M/G/1/1 queueing system. We introduce a probabilistically preemptive packet management policy, under which an existing packet from the same source in the system is replaced by an arriving packet with a fixed probability. We derive the moment generating functions (MGFs) of the age of information (AoI) and peak AoI (PAoI) for each source under this policy.

Inf. Theory", "summary": "This paper addresses the reconstruction of sparse signals from generalized linear measurements. Signal sparsity is assumed to be sublinear in the signal dimension while it was proportional to the signal dimension in conventional research. Approximate message-passing (AMP) has poor convergence properties for sensing matrices beyond standard Gaussian matrices. To solve this convergence issue, generalized orthogonal AMP (GOAMP) is proposed for signals with sublinear sparsity. The main feature of GOAMP is the so-called Onsager correction to realize asymptotic Gaussianity of estimation errors. The Onsager correction in GOAMP is designed via state evolution for orthogonally invariant sensing matrices in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity and measurement dimension tend to infinity at sublinear speed in the signal dimension. When the support of non-zero signals does not contain a neighborhood of the origin, GOAMP using Bayesian denoisers is proved to achieve error-free signal reconstruction for linear measurements if and only if the measurement dimension is larger than a threshold, which is equal to that of AMP for standard Gaussian sensing matrices. Numerical simulations are also presented for linear measurements and 1-bit compressed sensing. When ill-conditioned sensing matrices are used, GOAMP for sublinear sparsity is shown to outperform existing reconstruction algorithms, including generalized AMP for sublinear sparsity."}

This adaptive approach facilitates the conveyance of extra bits to the receiver, which means it needs less cost of radio-frequency chains at transmitter while improving SE. Besides, the proposed schemes offer an inherent PLS security advantage, as the eavesdropper is unable to completely detect signals reflected from the RIS. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed RASM and RASSK schemes, this paper presents a detailed analytical performance of their spectral efficiency, detection complexity, bit error rate, and secrecy rate, which are accompanied by insightful findings and conclusions.
