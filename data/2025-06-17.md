### [2] [Functional Multi-Reference Alignment via Deconvolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12201)

Result: 通过去卷积方法成功估计信号，验证了理论和实验的有效性。

Conclusion: 扩展的Kotlarski公式为MRA问题提供了新的解决方案，同时为去卷积文献做出贡献。

Abstract: This paper studies the multi-reference alignment (MRA) problem of estimating
a signal function from shifted, noisy observations. Our functional formulation
reveals a new connection between MRA and deconvolution: the signal can be
estimated from second-order statistics via Kotlarski's formula, an important
identification result in deconvolution with replicated measurements. To design
our MRA algorithms, we extend Kotlarski's formula to general dimension and
study the estimation of signals with vanishing Fourier transform, thus also
contributing to the deconvolution literature. We validate our deconvolution
approach to MRA through both theory and numerical experiments.

### [3] [Communication Complexity of Exact Sampling under Rényi Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12219)
*Spencer Hill,Fady Alajaji,Tamás Linder*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了在共享序列分布Q的情况下，从分布P中采样并通信的问题，扩展了Li和El Gamal的结果，提出了关于Campbell成本和Rényi熵的上下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在非因果采样协议下，如何最小化通信成本，并推广到更一般的成本函数（如Campbell成本和Rényi熵）。

Method: 使用Poisson函数表示法，推导了Campbell成本和Rényi熵的上下界，并与Rényi散度关联。

Result: 证明了上下界近似为Rényi散度D_{1/α}(P||Q)，并通过数值实验验证了上下界通常在5-10比特内接近。

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅推广了现有理论，还通过数值示例展示了其实际适用性，为相关领域提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: We study the problem of communicating a sample from a probability
distribution $P$ given shared access to a sequence distributed according to
another probability distribution $Q$. Li and El Gamal used the Poisson
functional representation to show that the minimum expected message length to
communicate a sample from $P$ can be upper bounded by $D(P||Q) + \log (D(P||Q)
+ 1) + 4$, where $D(\, \cdot \, || \, \cdot\, )$ is the Kullback-Leibler
divergence. We generalize this and related results to a cost which is
exponential in the message length, specifically $L(t)$, Campbell's average
codeword length of order $t$, and to R\'enyi's entropy. We lower bound the
Campbell cost and R\'enyi entropy of communicating a sample under any (possibly
noncausal) sampling protocol, showing that it grows approximately as
$D_{1/\alpha}(P||Q)$, where $D_\beta(\,\cdot \,|| \,\cdot\,)$ is the R\'enyi
divergence of order $\beta$. Using the Poisson functional representation, we
prove an upper bound on $L(t)$ and $H_\alpha(K)$ which has a leading R\'enyi
divergence term with order within $\epsilon$ of the lower bound. Our results
reduce to the bounds of Harsha et al. as $\alpha \to 1$. We also provide
numerical examples comparing the bounds in the cases of normal and Laplacian
distributions, demonstrating that the upper and lower bounds are typically
within 5-10 bits of each other.

### [4] [Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Multi-Modal Semantic Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12368)

Conclusion: 提出的多模态语义通信系统结合了SIM和语义通信的优势，为高效传输复杂场景信息提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) powered by generative artificial intelligence
enables highly efficient and reliable information transmission. However, it
still necessitates the transmission of substantial amounts of data when dealing
with complex scene information. In contrast, the stacked intelligent
metasurface (SIM), leveraging wave-domain computing, provides a cost-effective
solution for directly imaging complex scenes. Building on this concept, we
propose an innovative SIM-aided multi-modal SemCom system. Specifically, an SIM
is positioned in front of the transmit antenna for transmitting visual semantic
information of complex scenes via imaging on the uniform planar array at the
receiver. Furthermore, the simple scene description that contains textual
semantic information is transmitted via amplitude-phase modulation over
electromagnetic waves. To simultaneously transmit multi-modal information, we
optimize the amplitude and phase of meta-atoms in the SIM using a customized
gradient descent algorithm. The optimization aims to gradually minimize the
mean squared error between the normalized energy distribution on the receiver
array and the desired pattern corresponding to the visual semantic information.
By combining the textual and visual semantic information, a conditional
generative adversarial network is used to recover the complex scene accurately.
Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
multi-modal SemCom system in reducing bandwidth overhead as well as the
capability of the SIM for imaging the complex scene.

Motivation: Costas数组因其最优的非周期自相关特性而备受关注。在多用户系统中，信号间的互干扰也应尽可能小，因此研究具有小最大互相关值的Costas数组家族具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 本文通过分析多个Costas数组家族，为多用户系统中的信号设计提供了理论支持，特别是在限制最大互相关值方面取得了重要进展。

Abstract: Costas arrays have been an interesting combinatorial object for decades
because of their optimal aperiodic auto-correlation properties. Meanwhile, it
is interesting to find families of Costas arrays or extended arrays with small
maximal cross-correlation values, since for applications in multi-user systems,
the cross-interferences between different signals should also be small. The
objective of this paper is to study several large-size families of Costas
arrays or extended arrays, and their values of maximal cross-correlation are
partially bounded for some cases of horizontal shifts $u$ and vertical shifts
$v$. Given a prime $p \geq 5$, in particular, a large-size family of Costas
arrays over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ is investigated, including both the
exponential Welch Costas arrays and logarithmic Welch Costas arrays. An upper
bound on the maximal cross-correlation of this family for arbitrary $u$ and $v$
is given. We also show that the maximal cross-correlation of the family of
power permutations over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ for $u = 0$ and $v \neq 0$ is
bounded by $\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{p-1}$. Furthermore, we give the first nontrivial
upper bound of $(p-1)/t$ on the maximal cross-correlation of the larger family
including both exponential Welch Costas arrays and power permutations over
$\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ for arbitrary $u$ and $v=0$, where $t$ is the smallest
prime divisor of $(p-1)/2$.

### [6] [Optimal and Suboptimal Decoders under Finite-Alphabet Interference: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12646)

Conclusion: 本文为干扰影响提供了新见解，提出了更准确的性能评估框架，并扩展了接收器设计方法。

Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not
optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or
computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance
complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used
performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information, fail to capture
the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate
performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool
for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use
mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat
interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics.
Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under
interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be
matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched
capacity is derived using Mutual Information (MI), while a lower bound on the
mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using the
Generalized Mutual Information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the
proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in
Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that
GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput performance of BICM-type systems.
Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases,
with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder
optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In
short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference,
proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance
evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.

### [7] [SIC-Free Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Constellation-Constrained Optimization and Application to Large-Scale Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12668)
*Sibo Zhang,Bruno Clerckx,David Vargas*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: RSMA在无线通信系统中具有潜力，无需依赖SIC接收器。本文评估了RSMA的理论极限，设计了优化算法，并解决了计算复杂度问题。结果显示，无SIC的RSMA性能损失较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 优化后的无SIC RSMA在加权和速率和MMF性能上仅轻微损失，适合未来应用。

Conclusion: 无SIC的RSMA是一种可行的替代方案，性能接近传统RSMA，且复杂度更低。

Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising
multiple access technique for future wireless communication systems. Recent
research demonstrates that RSMA can maintain its superiority without relying on
Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers. In practical systems,
SIC-free receivers are more attractive than SIC receivers because of their low
complexity and latency. This paper evaluates the theoretical limits of RSMA
with and without SIC receivers under finite constellations. We first derive the
constellation-constrained rate expressions for RSMA. We then design algorithms
based on projected subgradient ascent to optimize the precoders and maximize
the weighted sum-rate or max-min fairness (MMF) among users. To apply the
proposed optimization algorithms to large-scale systems, one challenge lies in
the exponentially increasing computational complexity brought about by the
constellation-constrained rate expressions. In light of this, we propose
methods to avoid such computational burden. Numerical results show that, under
optimized precoders, SIC-free RSMA leads to minor losses in weighted sum-rate
and MMF performance in comparison to RSMA with SIC receivers, making it a
viable option for future implementations.

### [8] [Lempel-Ziv Complexity, Empirical Entropies, and Chain Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12772)
*Neri Merhav*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了LZ78算法在独立应用于有限序列的$k$-块时的压缩比上下界，并通过归一化经验熵表达。结果表明，当经验熵阶数相对于$k$较小时，上界紧致；较大时，下界紧致。此外，提出了LZ复杂度的链式法则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LZ78算法在有限序列$k$-块上的压缩性能，并分析其与经验熵的关系。

Method: 通过理论推导，给出压缩比的上下界，并分析其与经验熵阶数和$k$的关系。

Result: 上下界在特定条件下紧致，并提出了LZ复杂度的链式法则。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LZ78算法的压缩性能与经验熵的关系，并提出了新的理论工具（如链式法则）。

Abstract: We derive upper and lower bounds on the overall compression ratio of the 1978
Lempel-Ziv (LZ78) algorithm, applied independently to $k$-blocks of a finite
individual sequence. Both bounds are given in terms of normalized empirical
entropies of the given sequence. For the bounds to be tight and meaningful, the
order of the empirical entropy should be small relative to $k$ in the upper
bound, but large relative to $k$ in the lower bound. Several non-trivial
conclusions arise from these bounds. One of them is a certain form of a chain
rule of the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity, which decomposes the joint LZ
complexity of two sequences, say, $\bx$ and $\by$, into the sum of the LZ
complexity of $\bx$ and the conditional LZ complexity of $\by$ given $\bx$ (up
to small terms). The price of this decomposition, however, is in changing the
length of the block. Additional conclusions are discussed as well.

### [9] [Optimal Reconstruction Codes with Given Reads in Multiple Burst-Substitutions Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12924)
*Wenjun Yu,Yubo Sun,Zixiang Xu,Gennian Ge,Moshe Schwartz*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study optimal reconstruction codes over the multiple-burst substitution
channel. Our main contribution is establishing a trade-off between the
error-correction capability of the code, the number of reads used in the
reconstruction process, and the decoding list size. We show that over a channel
that introduces at most $t$ bursts, we can use a length-$n$ code capable of
correcting $\epsilon$ errors, with $\Theta(n^\rho)$ reads, and decoding with a
list of size $O(n^\lambda)$, where $t-1=\epsilon+\rho+\lambda$. In the process
of proving this, we establish sharp asymptotic bounds on the size of error
balls in the burst metric. More precisely, we prove a Johnson-type lower bound
via Kahn's Theorem on large matchings in hypergraphs, and an upper bound via a
novel variant of Kleitman's Theorem under the burst metric, which might be of
independent interest.
  Beyond this main trade-off, we derive several related results using a variety
of combinatorial techniques. In particular, along with tools from recent
advances in discrete geometry, we improve the classical Gilbert-Varshamov bound
in the asymptotic regime for multiple bursts, and determine the minimum
redundancy required for reconstruction codes with polynomially many reads. We
also propose an efficient list-reconstruction algorithm that achieves the above
guarantees, based on a majority-with-threshold decoding scheme.

Abstract: Integrated communication and sensing, which can make full use of the limited
spectrum resources to perform communication and sensing tasks simultaneously,
is an up-and-coming technology in wireless communication networks. In this
work, we investigate the secrecy performance of an uncrewed aerial vehicle
(UAV)-assisted secure integrated communication, sensing, and computing system,
where the UAV sends radar signals to locate and disrupt potential eavesdroppers
while providing offload services to ground users (GUs). Considering the
constraints of UAV maximum speed, transmit power, and propulsion energy, as
well as secure offloading, data transmission, and computation time, the total
energy consumption of GUs is minimized by jointly optimizing user offloading
ratio, user scheduling strategy, transmit beamforming, and UAV trajectory. An
efficient iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex
optimization problem caused by tightly coupled dependent variables. In
particular, the original optimization problem is decomposed into four
sub-optimization problems, and the non-convex sub-problems are transformed into
approximately convex forms via successive convex approximation. Then, all
sub-problems are solved successively by using the block coordinate descent
technique. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence and validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Method: 采用标量格点量化，结合模运算、抖动和概率整形，分析类似脏纸编码但需额外步骤限制失真。

Result: 实现了WZ率失真对，并通过仿真验证了短极性码的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了高斯源WZ问题，并可扩展至向量源。

Abstract: Scalar lattice quantization with a modulo operator, dithering, and
probabilistic shaping is applied to the Wyner-Ziv (WZ) problem with a Gaussian
source and mean square error distortion. The method achieves the WZ
rate-distortion pairs. The analysis is similar to that for dirty paper coding
but requires additional steps to bound the distortion because the modulo shift
is correlated with the source noise. The results extend to vector sources by
reverse waterfilling on the spectrum of the covariance matrix of the source
noise. Simulations with short polar codes illustrate the performance and
compare with scalar quantizers and polar coded quantization without dithering.

Conclusion: 该方案有效提升了极化码在干扰环境中的性能，同时保持了AWGN噪声下的表现。

Abstract: A scheme to select information indices in polar codes is proposed to form
signals with spectral comb shapes under BPSK modulation, whereby the signal
could be separated from periodic interference in spectrum. By selecting proper
indices to load information bits in polar coding, a spectral comb shape signal
is formed, which has periodic zeros and notch bands uniformly distributed in
its frequency spectrum. Furthermore, to mitigate the negative impact of
proposed polar code on the AWGN performance, a scheme termed error performance
enhancement scheme is proposed, whereby the performance loss under AWGN noise
could be alleviated. Numerical results are given under periodic interference
and AWGN noise, indicating that a considerable signal-to-noise power ratio
(SNR) gain is accomplished in comparison with conventional polar codes.

Abstract: The explosive growth of teletraffic, fueled by the convergence of
cyber-physical systems and data-intensive applications, such as the Internet of
Things (IoT), autonomous systems, and immersive communications, demands a
multidisciplinary suite of innovative solutions across the physical and network
layers. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) represent a transformative advancement in

provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in FAS research. We
begin by examining key application scenarios in which FAS offers significant
advantages. We then present the fundamental principles of FAS, covering channel
measurement and modeling, single-user configurations, and the multi-user fluid
antenna multiple access (FAMA) framework. Following this, we delve into key
network-layer techniques such as quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning, power
allocation, and content placement strategies. We conclude by identifying
prevailing challenges and outlining future research directions to support the
continued development of FAS in next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, several governments in developing and developed
countries have started their journey toward digital transformation. However,
the pace and maturity of digital technologies and strategies are different
between public services. Current literature indicates that research on the
digital transformation of urban planning is still developing. Therefore, the

Abstract: In this study, a new scheduling strategies for low-density parity-check
(LDPC) codes under layered belief propagation (LBP) is designed. Based on the
criteria of prioritizing the update of check nodes with lower error
probabilities, we propose two dynamic scheduling methods: dynamic error belief
propagation (Dyn-EBP) and dynamic penalty error belief propagation (Dyn-PEBP).
In Dyn-EBP, each check node is restricted from being updated the same number of
times, whereas Dyn-PEBP removes this restriction and instead introduces a
penalty term to balance the number of updates. Simulation results show that,
for 5G new radio (NR) LDPC codes, our proposed scheduling methods can
outperform existing dynamic and offline scheduling strategies under various
blocklengths and code rates. This demonstrates that prioritizing the update of
check nodes with lower error probabilities can lead to higher decoding
efficiency and validates the effectiveness of our algorithms.

Abstract: Integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enabling intelligent services in future sixth-generation
(6G) networks. However, existing ISCC systems based on fixed-antenna
architectures inherently lack spatial adaptability to cope with the signal
degradation and dynamic environmental conditions. Recently, non-fixed flexible
antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna
(MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest. Among them,
intelligent rotatable antenna (IRA) is an emerging technology that offers
significant potential to better support the comprehensive services of target
sensing, data transmission, and edge computing. This article investigates a
novel IRA-enabled ISCC framework to enhance received signal strength, wider
coverage, and spatial adaptability to dynamic wireless environments by flexibly
adjusting the boresight of directional antennas. Building upon this, we
introduce the fundamentals of IRA technology and explore IRA's benefits for
improving system performance while providing potential task-oriented
applications. Then, we discuss the main design issues and provide solutions for
implementing IRA-based ISCC systems. Finally, experimental results are provided
to demonstrate the great potential of IRA-enabled ISCC system, thus paving the
way for more robust and efficient future wireless networks.

Abstract: This paper resolves two open problems from a recent paper, arXiv:2403.16981,
concerning the sample complexity of distributed simple binary hypothesis
testing under information constraints. The first open problem asks whether
interaction reduces the sample complexity of distributed simple binary
hypothesis testing. In this paper, we show that sequential interaction does not
help. The second problem suggests tightening existing sample complexity bounds
for communication-constrained simple binary hypothesis testing. We derive
optimally tight bounds for this setting and resolve this problem. Our main
technical contributions are: (i) a one-shot lower bound on the Bayes error in
simple binary hypothesis testing that satisfies a crucial tensorisation
property; (ii) a streamlined proof of the formula for the sample complexity of
simple binary hypothesis testing without constraints, first established in
arXiv:2403.16981; and (iii) a reverse data-processing inequality for
Hellinger-$\lambda$ divergences, generalising the results from arXiv:1812.03031
and arXiv:2206.02765.

Abstract: Wi-Fi technology has evolved from simple communication routers to sensing
devices. Wi-Fi sensing leverages conventional Wi-Fi transmissions to extract
and analyze channel state information (CSI) for applications like proximity
detection, occupancy detection, activity recognition, and health monitoring. By
leveraging existing infrastructure, Wi-Fi sensing offers a privacy-preserving,
non-intrusive, and cost-effective solution which, unlike cameras, is not

Wi-Fi standardization activities, this tutorial-cum-survey first introduces
fundamental concepts related to Wi-Fi CSI, outlines the CSI measurement
methods, and examines the impact of mobile objects on CSI. The mechanics of a
simplified testbed for CSI extraction are also described. Then, we present a
qualitative comparison of the existing Wi-Fi sensing datasets, their
specifications, and pin-point their shortcomings. Next, a variety of
preprocessing techniques are discussed that are beneficial for feature
extraction and explainability of machine learning (ML) algorithms. We then
provide a qualitative review of recent ML approaches in the domain of Wi-Fi
sensing and present the significance of self-supervised learning (SSL) in that
context. Specifically, the mechanics of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning solutions is elaborated in detail and a quantitative comparative
analysis is presented in terms of classification accuracy. Finally, the article
concludes by highlighting emerging technologies that can be leveraged to
enhance the performance of Wi-Fi sensing and opportunities for further research
in this domain

Conclusion: (P)DCN为基于DAG的深度学习提供了高效且理论支持的框架。

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are central to science and engineering
applications including causal inference, scheduling, and neural architecture
search. In this work, we introduce the DAG Convolutional Network (DCN), a novel
graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed specifically for convolutional
learning from signals supported on DAGs. The DCN leverages causal graph filters
to learn nodal representations that account for the partial ordering inherent
to DAGs, a strong inductive bias does not present in conventional GNNs. Unlike
prior art in machine learning over DAGs, DCN builds on formal convolutional
operations that admit spectral-domain representations. We further propose the
Parallel DCN (PDCN), a model that feeds input DAG signals to a parallel bank of
causal graph-shift operators and processes these DAG-aware features using a
shared multilayer perceptron. This way, PDCN decouples model complexity from
graph size while maintaining satisfactory predictive performance. The
architectures' permutation equivariance and expressive power properties are
also established. Comprehensive numerical tests across several tasks, datasets,
and experimental conditions demonstrate that (P)DCN compares favorably with
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational
efficiency. These results position (P)DCN as a viable framework for deep
learning from DAG-structured data that is designed from first (graph) signal
processing principles.

Motivation: 解决载波频率偏移（CFO）引起的零点旋转问题，且不依赖信道编码。

Method: 通过缩小相邻零点间的角度（首尾除外）引入间隙，接收端通过识别间隙位置估计并校正相位旋转。

Result: SBMOCZ在无CFO时性能略低于Huffman BMOCZ，但在衰落信道中通过CPC实现了4 dB的BER提升。

Conclusion: SBMOCZ有效解决了CFO问题，在特定场景下性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a new binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal
zeros (BMOCZ) zero constellation, which we call smooshed binary modulation on
conjugate-reciprocal zeros (SBMOCZ), to address carrier frequency offset
(CFO)-induced zero rotation without depending on channel coding. In our
approach, we modify the phase mapping of Huffman BMOCZ by shrinking the angle
between adjacent zeros, except for the first and last, to introduce a gap in
the zero constellation. By discerning the gap location in the received
polynomial, the receiver can estimate and correct the phase rotation. We
demonstrate the error rate performance of SBMOCZ relative to Huffman BMOCZ,
showing that SBMOCZ addresses a CFO-induced rotation at the cost of a modest
performance reduction compared to Huffman BMOCZ in the absence of a CFO.
Finally, we compare SBMOCZ to Huffman BMOCZ using a cyclically permutable code
(CPC), showing a 4 dB bit error rate (BER) improvement in a fading channel,
while demonstrating comparable performance across other simulations.

Conclusion: 该方案首次探索了基于DMA的信道估计方法，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are emerging as a promising technology to
enable energy-efficient, large array-based multi-antenna systems. This paper
presents a simple channel estimation scheme for the downlink of a
multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MISO-OFDM) communication system exploiting DMAs. The proposed scheme extracts
separate estimates of the wireless channel and the unknown waveguide
propagation vector using a simple iterative algorithm based on the parallel
factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. Obtaining decoupled estimates of the wireless
channel and inner waveguide vector enables the isolation and compensation for
its effect when designing the DMA beamformer, regardless of the wireless
channel state, which evolves much faster due to its shorter coherence time and
bandwidth. Additionally, our solution operates in a data-aided manner,
delivering estimates of useful data symbols jointly with channel estimates,
without requiring sequential pilot and data stages. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to explore this CE approach. Numerical
results corroborate the notable performance of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: With the development of the upcoming sixth-generation networks (6G),
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have gained significant attention
due to its ability of reconfiguring wireless channels via smart reflections.
However, traditional channel state information (CSI) acquisition techniques for
double-RIS systems face challenges (e.g., high pilot overhead or multipath
interference). This paper proposes a new channel generation method in
double-RIS communication systems based on the tool of conditional diffusion
model (CDM). The CDM is trained on synthetic channel data to capture channel
characteristics. It addresses the limitations of traditional CSI generation
methods, such as insufficient model understanding capability and poor
environmental adaptability. We provide a detailed analysis of the diffusion
process for channel generation, and it is validated through simulations. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CDM based method outperforms
traditional channel acquisition methods in terms of normalized mean squared
error (NMSE). This method offers a new paradigm for channel acquisition in
double-RIS systems, which is expected to improve the quality of channel
acquisition with low pilot overhead.

Abstract: Direct satellite-to-device communication is a promising future direction due
to its lower latency and enhanced efficiency. However, intermittent and
unpredictable terrestrial interference significantly affects system reliability
and performance. Continuously employing sophisticated interference mitigation
techniques is practically inefficient. Motivated by the periodic idle intervals
characteristic of burst-mode satellite transmissions, this paper investigates
online interference detection frameworks specifically tailored for
satellite-to-device scenarios. We first rigorously formulate interference
detection as a binary hypothesis testing problem, leveraging differences
between Rayleigh (no interference) and Rice (interference present)
distributions. Then, we propose a cumulative sum (CUSUM)-based online detector
for scenarios with known interference directions, explicitly characterizing the
trade-off between detection latency and false alarm rate, and establish its
asymptotic optimality. For practical scenarios involving unknown interference
direction, we further propose a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)-based
detection method, jointly estimating interference direction via the Root-MUSIC
algorithm. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate
that our proposed methods achieve high detection accuracy with remarkably low
latency, highlighting their practical applicability in future
satellite-to-device communication systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate real-time interference mitigation in multiuser
wireless networks assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). Unlike conventional methods
that rely on instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we consider a
practical scenario where only statistical CSI is available, and the STAR-RIS
phase shifts are impaired by random phase errors modeled via the Von Mises
distribution. To tackle the resulting nonconvex optimization problem induced by
unit-modulus constraints and stochastic interference, we derive a closed-form
approximation of the effective channel matrix using statistical expectations.
We then reformulate the interference minimization problem as an unconstrained
optimization over a Riemannian manifold and propose a conjugate gradient
algorithm tailored to the complex circle manifold. The proposed solution
enables efficient real-time computation of optimal phase shifts while
accounting for hardware imperfections and limited CSI. Simulation results
confirm that our method significantly suppresses inter-user interference and
achieves superior SINR performance and convergence speed compared to
conventional baselines.

Conclusion: MORIC方法提高了Wi-Fi CSI在真实场景中的实用性，为人类活动识别提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The newly established IEEE 802.11bf Task Group aims to amend the WLAN
standard to support advanced sensing applications such as human activity
recognition (HAR). Although studies have demonstrated the potential of sub-7
GHz Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for HAR, no method currently performs
reliably in real-world scenarios. This work tackles the poor generalization of
Wi-Fi-based HAR by introducing an innovative approach to extracting and
utilizing movement-related representations, which makes it robust to noise and
static environmental properties. This is achieved by transforming CSI signals
into the delay profile space and decomposing them into various Doppler
velocities, which serve as informative projections of a mobile point's velocity
from different unknown random angles. To mitigate the impact of this
randomness, MORIC is introduced as a novel time series classification model
based on random convolutional kernels, designed to be invariant to the random
order and repetition of input representations, thereby enabling robust Wi-Fi
CSI-based activity classification. Experimental results on the collected
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches in terms of generalization accuracy for hand motion recognition,
particularly for challenging gestures. Furthermore, incorporating a small
number of calibration samples leads to a significant improvement in accuracy,
enhancing the practicality of the method for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications generally rely on cognitive radio
(CR)-based ad-hoc networks due to challenges such as long propagation delay,
limited channel resources, and high attenuation. To address the constraints of
limited frequency resources, UWA communications have recently incorporated
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), significantly enhancing
spectral efficiency (SE) through multiplexing gains. Still, {the} low
propagation speed of UWA signals, combined with {the} dynamic underwater
environment, creates asynchrony in multiple access scenarios. This causes
inaccurate spectrum sensing as inter-carrier interference (ICI) increases,
which leads to difficulties in resource allocation. As efficient resource
allocation is essential for achieving high-quality communication in OFDMA-based
CR networks, these challenges degrade communication reliability in UWA systems.
To resolve the issue, we propose an end-to-end sensing and resource
optimization method using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in an OFDMA-based
UWA-CR network. Through extensive simulations, we confirm that the proposed
method is superior to baseline schemes, outperforming other methods by 42.9 %
in SE and 4.4 % in communication success rate.

Abstract: Sensing emerges as a critical challenge in 6G networks, which require
simultaneous communication and target sensing capabilities. State-of-the-art
super-resolution techniques for the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation
encounter significant performance limitations when the number of targets
exceeds antenna array dimensions. This paper introduces a novel sensing
parameter estimation algorithm for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
(OFDM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems. The proposed
approach implements a strategic two-stage methodology: first, discriminating
targets through delay and Doppler domain filtering to reduce the number of
effective targets for super-resolution DoA estimation, and second, introducing
a fusion technique to mitigate sidelobe interferences. The algorithm enables
robust DoA estimation, particularly in high-density target environments with
limited-size antenna arrays. Numerical simulations validate the superior
performance of the proposed method compared to conventional DoA estimation
approaches.

Abstract: Fusion of passive and active measurements from sensor nodes becomes critical
in localizing underwater objects and is traditionally achieved by communicating
information to a central node. This causes significant inefficiencies in
bandwidth, energy, and processing time, which are critical in marine
applications. With integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the
process of sensing, localization, and communication can be achieved jointly,
and the inefficiencies can be minimized. Thus, the primary objective of this
study is to analyse the efficacy of such communication signals in localizing a
moving target in given underwater conditions. The Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB) is a performance metric used to determine the theoretical lower bound on
localization errors. Simulation results illustrate the contours of localization
error across various scenarios, offering valuable insights into system
performance under different target dynamics and sea state conditions,
showcasing their potential for efficient and reliable underwater localization
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PASS系统在多址接入方案下的性能表现，优化发射功率以满足用户速率需求。

Method: 针对NOMA和FDMA提出两阶段算法，利用SCA方法和相位调整；针对TDMA利用时间切换特性优化波束成形。

Result: PASS性能优于传统天线系统；NOMA优于FDMA，TDMA在对称用户速率需求下优于NOMA。

Conclusion: PASS在多址接入方案中具有显著性能优势，不同方案适用于不同场景。

Abstract: A fundamental two-user PASS-based communication system is considered under
three MA schemes, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency
division multiple access (FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA). For
each MA scheme, a pinching beamforming optimization problem is formulated to
minimize the required transmit power for satisfying users' rate requirements.
For NOMA and FDMA, a two-stage algorithm is proposed, where the locations of
PAs are derived sequentially by using the successive convex approximation (SCA)
method and fine-turning phase adjustment. For TDMA, by leveraging the
time-switching feature of PASS, the optimal pinching beamforming of each time
slot is derived to maximize the served user channel gain. Numerical results are
provided to show that: 1) PASS can achieve a significant performance gain over
conventional antenna systems, and 2) NOMA consistently outperforms FDMA, while
TDMA provides superior performance than NOMA for symmetric user rate
requirements.

Abstract: As the demand for ubiquitous connectivity and high-precision environmental
awareness grows, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a
key technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Intelligent
metasurfaces (IMs) have also been widely adopted in ISAC scenarios due to their
efficient, programmable control over electromagnetic waves. This provides a
versatile solution that meets the dual-function requirements of next-generation
networks. Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been
extensively studied for manipulating the propagation channel between base and
mobile stations, the full potential of IMs in ISAC transceiver design remains
under-explored. Against this backdrop, this article explores emerging
IM-enabled transceiver designs for ISAC systems. It begins with an overview of
representative IM architectures, their unique principles, and their inherent
advantages in EM wave manipulation. Next, a unified ISAC framework is
established to systematically model the design and derivation of diverse
IM-enabled transceiver structures. This lays the foundation for performance
optimization, trade-offs, and analysis. The paper then discusses several
critical technologies for IM-enabled ISAC transceivers, including dedicated
channel modeling, effective channel estimation, tailored beamforming
strategies, and dual-functional waveform design.
