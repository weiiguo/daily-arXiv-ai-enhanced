### [1] [AMP-based Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation for Massive Grant-Free Access in OFDM-based Wideband Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06540)
*Zhiyan Li,Ying Cui,Danny H. K. Tsang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于近似消息传递（AMP）的算法（AMP-A-EC和AMP-A-AC），用于解决OFDM无授权接入中的设备活动检测和信道估计问题，显著提升了性能和计算效率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有OFDM无授权接入方法在频率选择性衰落下的设备活动检测和信道估计精度或计算时间不足，需要改进。

Method: 1. 提出精确的时域信号模型；2. 首次构建MAP设备活动检测和MMSE信道估计问题；3. 设计新因子图并开发两种AMP算法（AMP-A-EC和AMP-A-AC）。

Abstract: To realize orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based grant-free
access for wideband systems under frequency-selective fading, existing device
activity detection and channel estimation methods need substantial accuracy
improvement or computation time reduction. In this paper, we aim to resolve
this issue. First, we present an exact time-domain signal model for OFDM-based
grant-free access under frequency-selective fading. Then, we present a maximum
a posteriori (MAP)-based device activity detection problem and two minimum mean
square error (MMSE)-based channel estimation problems. The MAP-based device
activity detection problem and one of the MMSE-based channel estimation
problems are formulated for the first time. Next, we build a new factor graph
that captures the exact statistics of time-domain channels and device
activities. Based on it, we propose two approximate message passing (AMP)-based
algorithms, AMP-A-EC and AMP-A-AC, to approximately solve the MAP-based device
activity detection problem and two MMSE-based channel estimation problems. Both
proposed algorithms alleviate the AMP's inherent convergence problem when the
pilot length is smaller or comparable to the number of active devices. Then, we
analyze AMP-A-EC's error probability of activity detection and mean square
error (MSE) of channel estimation via state evolution and show that AMP-A-AC
has the lower computational complexity (in dominant term). Finally, numerical
results show the two proposed AMP-based algorithms' superior performance and
respective preferable regions, revealing their significant values for
OFDM-based grant-free access.

### [2] [Communication-Learning Co-Design for Differentially Private Over-the-Air Federated Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06557)
*Zihao Hu,Jia Yan,Ying-Jun Angela Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于差分隐私的无线联邦蒸馏框架，通过多接入信道的叠加特性实现通信效率与隐私保护的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在大模型时代面临通信效率和隐私保护的挑战。

Method: 利用差分隐私和无线信道的叠加特性，设计联合通信与学习的优化问题。

Result: 提出的方法在通信开销和学习-隐私权衡上优于传统联邦学习基准。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模联邦学习提供了高效的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: The ever-growing learning model size nowadays challenges the communication
efficiency and privacy preservation of the traditional federated learning (FL).
In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private (DP) over-the-air
federated distillation (FD) framework, where wireless devices (WDs)
periodically share noise-perturbed model outputs with the parameter server by
harnessing the superposition property of multi-access channels. Accordingly,
over-the-air FD enables the shared responsibility of the DP preservation on the
low-dimensional disclosed signals among WDs. We study the
communication-learning co-design problem in differentially private over-the-air
FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting the transmit
power and DP requirements of WDs. The main challenge is rooted in the
intractable learning and privacy analysis in over-the-air FD, together with the
strong coupling among the decision variables spanning two timescales. To tackle
this problem, we first derive the analytical learning convergence rate and
privacy losses of WDs, based on which the optimal transceiver design per FD
round and long-term training rounds decision are obtained in the closed forms.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed differentially private
over-the-air FD approach achieves a better learning-privacy trade-off with
largely-reduced communication overhead than the conventional FL benchmarks.

### [3] [When isometry and equivalence for skew constacyclic codes coincide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06695)
*Monica Nevins,Susanne Pumpluen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文证明了$(n,\sigma)$-等距与$(n,\sigma)$-等价在大多数斜$(\sigma,a)$-常循环码中一致，并提出了新的等价和等距定义以更精确分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究斜$(\sigma,a)$-常循环码的等距与等价关系，以改进分类方法。

Method: 通过证明汉明权重保持同态在非结合代数中必须为一次，并在一般交换基环$S$下工作。

Result: 提出了新的等价和等距定义，能够精确捕捉所有汉明保持同构。

Conclusion: 新定义改进了斜常循环码的分类，并确定了非结合Petit代数间的同态。

Abstract: We show that the notions of $(n,\sigma)$-isometry and
$(n,\sigma)$-equivalence introduced by Ou-azzou et al coincide for most skew
$(\sigma,a)$-constacyclic codes of length $n$. To prove this, we show that all
Hamming-weight-preserving homomorphisms between their ambient algebras must
have degree one when those algebras are nonassociative. We work in the general
setting of commutative base rings $S$. As a consequence, we propose new
definitions of equivalence and isometry of skew constacyclic codes that exactly
capture all Hamming-preserving isomorphisms, and lead to tighter
classifications. In the process we determine homomorphisms between
nonassociative Petit algebras, prioritizing the algebras
$S[t;\sigma]/S[t;\sigma](t^n-a)$, which give rise to skew constacyclic codes.

### [4] [Generalized Samorodnitsky noisy function inequalities, with applications to error-correcting codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06940)
*Olakunle S. Abawonse,Jan Hazla,Ryan O'Donnell*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文将Samorodnitsky不等式从布尔函数推广到任意乘积概率分布下的函数，并确定了最优参数λ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Samorodnitsky不等式的适用范围，使其适用于更一般的函数和概率分布。

Method: 将不等式推广到任意乘积概率分布μ⊗ⁿ下的函数f:Ωⁿ→ℝ，并确定最优λ=λ(q,μ,ρ)。

Result: 得到了适用于任意有限字母表的线性码的编码理论结果。

Conclusion: 推广后的不等式具有更广泛的应用价值，特别是在编码理论中。

Abstract: An inequality by Samorodnitsky states that if $f : \mathbb{F}_2^n \to
\mathbb{R}$ is a nonnegative boolean function, and $S \subseteq [n]$ is chosen
by randomly including each coordinate with probability a certain $\lambda =
\lambda(q,\rho) < 1$, then \begin{equation}
  \log \|T_\rho f\|_q \leq \mathbb{E}_{S} \log \|\mathbb{E}(f|S)\|_q\;.
\end{equation} Samorodnitsky's inequality has several applications to the
theory of error-correcting codes. Perhaps most notably, it can be used to show
that \emph{any} binary linear code (with minimum distance $\omega(\log n)$)
that has vanishing decoding error probability on the BEC$(\lambda)$ (binary
erasure channel) also has vanishing decoding error on \emph{all} memoryless
symmetric channels with capacity above some $C = C(\lambda)$.
  Samorodnitsky determined the optimal $\lambda = \lambda(q,\rho)$ for his
inequality in the case that $q \geq 2$ is an integer. In this work, we
generalize the inequality to $f : \Omega^n \to \mathbb{R}$ under any product
probability distribution $\mu^{\otimes n}$ on $\Omega^n$; moreover, we
determine the optimal value of $\lambda = \lambda(q,\mu,\rho)$ for any real $q
\in [2,\infty]$, $\rho \in [0,1]$, and distribution~$\mu$. As one consequence,
we obtain the aforementioned coding theory result for linear codes over
\emph{any} finite alphabet.

### [5] [Neural Beam Field for Spatial Beam RSRP Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06956)
*Keqiang Guo,Yuheng Zhong,Xin Tong,Jiangbin Lyu,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Neural Beam Field (NBF)的混合神经物理框架，用于高效且可解释的空间波束RSRP预测，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集多用户无线网络中，准确预测波束级RSRP对波束管理至关重要，但高测量开销和快速信道变化带来了挑战。

Method: 采用混合设计，结合Transformer DNN学习多路径条件功率分布(MCPP)，并通过物理模块推断波束RSRP统计；引入预训练校准(PaC)策略提升适应性。

Result: NBF在预测精度、训练效率和泛化能力上显著优于传统方法，同时保持紧凑模型。

Conclusion: NBF为下一代密集无线网络提供了可扩展且物理基础扎实的智能波束管理解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) is
essential for beam management in dense multi-user wireless networks, yet
challenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations. This
paper proposes Neural Beam Field (NBF), a hybrid neural-physical framework for
efficient and interpretable spatial beam RSRP prediction. Central to our
approach is the introduction of the Multi-path Conditional Power Profile
(MCPP), which bridges site-specific multipath propagation with antenna/beam
configurations via closed-form analytical modeling. We adopt a decoupled
``blackbox-whitebox" design: a Transformer-based deep neural network (DNN)
learns the MCPP from sparse user measurements and positions, while a
physics-inspired module analytically infers beam RSRP statistics. To improve
convergence and adaptivity, we further introduce a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC)
strategy that leverages ray-tracing priors and on-site calibration using RSRP
data. Extensive simulations results demonstrate that NBF significantly
outperforms conventional table-based channel knowledge maps (CKMs) and pure
blackbox DNNs in prediction accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization,
while maintaining a compact model size. The proposed framework offers a
scalable and physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in
next-generation dense wireless networks.

### [6] [Neural Channel Knowledge Map Assisted Scheduling Optimization of Active IRSs in Multi-User Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07009)
*Xintong Chen,Zhenyu Jiang,Jiangbin Lyu,Liqun Fu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经通道知识图（CKM）的新型调度框架，用于解决智能反射面（IRS）在多用户系统中的路径损耗和调度复杂性问题。通过Transformer深度神经网络预测链路功率统计和频谱效率，并结合低复杂度调度算法，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能反射面（IRS）在下一代无线网络中具有潜力，但面临严重的双路径损耗和多用户调度复杂性。主动IRS部分解决了路径损耗问题，但仍需高效的调度方法。

Method: 设计了基于Transformer的深度神经网络（LPS-Net和SE-Net）预测链路功率统计和频谱效率，并提出低复杂度的SM-IB调度算法。

Result: 神经CKM显著提高了预测精度和计算效率，SM-IB算法在低复杂度下实现了接近最优的最大-最小吞吐量。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了IRS系统中的关键挑战，为未来无线网络提供了高效调度方案。

Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) have potential for significant
performance gains in next-generation wireless networks but face key challenges,
notably severe double-pathloss and complex multi-user scheduling due to
hardware constraints. Active IRSs partially address pathloss but still require
efficient scheduling in cell-level multi-IRS multi-user systems, whereby the
overhead/delay of channel state acquisition and the scheduling complexity both
rise dramatically as the user density and channel dimensions increase.
Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a novel scheduling framework
based on neural Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), designing Transformer-based deep
neural networks (DNNs) to predict ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) from
historical channel/throughput measurements tagged with user positions.
Specifically, two cascaded networks, LPS-Net and SE-Net, are designed to
predict link power statistics (LPS) and ergodic SE accurately. We further
propose a low-complexity Stable Matching-Iterative Balancing (SM-IB) scheduling
algorithm. Numerical evaluations verify that the proposed neural CKM
significantly enhances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, while
the SM-IB algorithm effectively achieves near-optimal max-min throughput with
greatly reduced complexity.

### [7] [Generalized Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes: Design and Efficient Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07030)
*Roxana Smarandache,David G. M. Mitchell,Anthony Gómez-Fonseca*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了准循环广义低密度奇偶校验（QC-GLDPC）码的构造方法，提出了基于多项式矩阵子式的生成矩阵构造技术，改进了编码效率，并提供了最小距离和码维度的计算方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GLDPC码在低延迟通信中表现优异，但缺乏高效的编码构造方法，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析多项式矩阵的子式，构造多种形式的生成矩阵，并应用双图提升技术优化码参数。

Result: 提出的方法能够高效实现编码，并提供最小距离和码维度的计算工具。

Conclusion: QC-GLDPC码的构造和性能优化方法为低延迟通信提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes, where single parity-check
constraints on the code bits are replaced with generalized constraints (an
arbitrary linear code), are a promising class of codes for low-latency
communication. The block error rate performance of the GLDPC codes, combined
with a complementary outer code, has been shown to outperform a variety of
state-of-the-art code and decoder designs with suitable lengths and rates for
the 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) regime. A major
drawback of these codes is that it is not known how to construct appropriate
polynomial matrices to encode them efficiently. In this paper, we analyze
practical constructions of quasi-cyclic GLDPC (QC-GLDPC) codes and show how to
construct polynomial generator matrices in various forms using minors of the
polynomial matrix. The approach can be applied to fully generalized matrices or
partially generalized (with mixed constraint node types) to find better
performance/rate trade-offs. The resulting encoding matrices are presented in
useful forms that facilitate efficient implementation. The rich substructure
displayed also provides us with new methods of determining low weight
codewords, providing lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance and often
giving those of weight equal to the minimum distance. Based on the minors of
the polynomial parity-check matrix, we also give a formula for the rank of any
parity-check matrix representing a QC-LDPC or QC-GLDPC code, and hence, the
dimension of the code. Finally, we show that by applying double graph-liftings,
the code parameters can be improved without affecting the ability to obtain a
polynomial generator matrix.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 通过全波仿真分析RIS架构中的结构散射，比较传统与电磁一致性模型。

Result: 发现当前模型在缓解结构散射问题上存在局限性。

Conclusion: 需开发新的优化策略以改进RIS设计。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising
technology for next-generation wireless communications, offering
energy-efficient control of electromagnetic (EM) waves. While conventional RIS
models based on phase shifts and amplitude adjustments have been widely
studied, they overlook complex EM phenomena such as mutual coupling, which are
crucial for advanced wave manipulations. Recent efforts in EM-consistent
modelling have provided more accurate representations of RIS behavior,
highlighting challenges like structural scattering-an unwanted signal
reflection that can lead to interference. In this paper, we analyze the impact
of structural scattering in RIS architectures and compare traditional and
EM-consistent models through full-wave simulations, thus providing practical
insights on the realistic performance of current RIS designs. Our findings
reveal the limitations of current modelling approaches in mitigating this
issue, underscoring the need for new optimization strategies.

Motivation: 探讨有限群环上的加法群码的结构及其与表示理论、群代数结构的联系。

Result: 证明了加法互补对的正交补关系，揭示了其与群代数结构的深刻联系。

Conclusion: 通过内积和互补对的研究，为有限群环上的编码理论提供了新的结构视角。

Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ and an extension of finite chain rings $S|R$, one
can consider the group rings $\mathscr{S} = S[G]$ and $\mathscr{R} = R[G]$. The
group ring $\mathscr{S}$ can be viewed as an $R$-bimodule, and any of its
$R$-submodules naturally inherits an $R$-bimodule structure; in the framework
of coding theory, these are called \emph{additive group codes}, more precisely
a (left) additive group code of is a linear code which is the image of a (left)
ideal of a group algebra via an isomorphism which maps $G$ to the standard
basis of $S^n$, where $n=|G|$. In the first part of the paper, the ring
extension $S|R$ is studied, and several $R$-module isomorphisms are established
for decomposing group rings, thereby providing a characterization of the
structure of additive group codes. In the second part, we construct a
symmetric, nondegenerate trace-Euclidean inner product on $\mathscr{S}$. Two
additive group codes $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ form an \emph{additive
complementary pair} (ACP) if $\mathcal{C} + \mathcal{D} = \mathscr{S}$ and
$\mathcal{C} \cap \mathcal{D} = \{0\}$. For two-sided ACPs, we prove that the
orthogonal complement of one code under the trace-Euclidean duality is
precisely the image of the other under an involutive anti-automorphism of
$\mathscr{S}$, linking coding-theoretical ACPs with module orthogonal
direct-sum decompositions, representation theory, and the structure of group
algebras over finite chain rings.

*Vukan Ninkovic,Dejan Vukobratovic*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自动编码器（AE）的结构化架构，用于扩展不等错误保护（UEP）编码的块长度，同时保持高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代通信系统需要支持不同可靠性级别的UEP编码，而现有基于AE的UEP编码在中等块长度下复杂度较高，应用受限。

Method: 通过将编码和解码分解为较小的AE子块，结合叠加编码和连续干扰消除（SIC）解码，提出了一种结构化AE架构。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法优于传统的随机叠加编码UEP方案，实现了更高的可扩展性和效率。

Conclusion: 结构化AE架构为下一代网络提供了一种高效且可扩展的UEP编码解决方案。

Abstract: Unequal error protection (UEP) coding that enables differentiated reliability
levels within a transmitted message is essential for modern communication
systems. Autoencoder (AE)-based code designs have shown promise in the context
of learned equal error protection (EEP) coding schemes. However, their
application to UEP remains largely unexplored, particularly at intermediate
blocklengths, due to the increasing complexity of AE-based models. Inspired by
the proven effectiveness of superposition coding and successive interference
cancellation (SIC) decoding in conventional UEP schemes, we propose a
structured AE-based architecture that extends AE-based UEP codes to
substantially larger blocklengths while maintaining efficient training. By
structuring encoding and decoding into smaller AE subblocks, our method
provides a flexible framework for fine-tuning UEP reliability levels while
adapting to diverse system parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed
approach improves over established achievability bounds of randomized
superposition coding-based UEP schemes with SIC decoding, making the proposed
structured AE-based UEP codes a scalable and efficient solution for
next-generation networks.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is pivotal for next-generation

ISAC systems critically important. In this paper, we propose the extended
Arimoto-Blahut (AB) algorithms to calculate the rate-distortion trade-off in
bistatic ISAC systems, which overcome the limitation of existing AB algorithms

variables to transform non-convex distortion constraints into linear
constraints, prove that the reformulated linearly-constrained optimization
problem maintains the same optimal solution as the original problem, and
develop extended AB algorithms for both squared error and logarithmic loss
distortion metrics based on the framework of AB algorithm. Numerical results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) has emerged as a key
enabler for low-altitude wireless networks with enhanced adaptability through
resource allocation co-design and intelligent environment awareness. However,
dynamic interference and channel attenuation constrain the potential of the
ISCC system. To address this challenge, we propose a novel movable
antenna-empowered ISCC system. An achievable data rate maximization problem is
formulated while guaranteeing the sensing and control quality-of-service (QoS)
by optimizing the positions of the antennas and the beamforming strategy for
communication, sensing, and control co-design. An efficient alternating
optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the highly coupled
non-convex problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed AO-based
algorithm achieves substantial gains in the achievable data rate and the
control QoS compared with benchmark schemes.

TL;DR: 研究目标导向通信系统中，通过优化采样和传输策略，最小化信息年龄（AoI），同时考虑传输成本和语义误差成本（CAE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅优化AoI，忽略了底层过程动态和语义误差的影响，导致性能不足。

Method: 提出一种静态随机策略，确保AoI在最优策略的有限倍数内，并通过数值实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明策略在不同参数下有效，揭示了AoI、CAE与成本之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 优化AoI需结合语义误差和动态过程，静态随机策略提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a goal-oriented communication system in which a source monitors an
environment that evolves as a discrete-time, two-state Markov chain. At each
time slot, a controller decides whether to sample the environment and if so
whether to transmit a raw or processed sample, to the controller. Processing
improves transmission reliability over an unreliable wireless channel, but
incurs an additional cost. The objective is to minimize the long-term average
age of information (AoI), subject to constraints on the costs incurred at the
source and the cost of actuation error (CAE), a semantic metric that assigns
different penalties to different actuation errors. Although reducing AoI can
potentially help reduce CAE, optimizing AoI alone is insufficient, as it
overlooks the evolution of the underlying process. For instance, faster source
dynamics lead to higher CAE for the same average AoI, and different AoI
trajectories can result in markedly different CAE under identical average AoI.
To address this, we propose a stationary randomized policy that achieves an
average AoI within a bounded multiplicative factor of the optimal among all
feasible policies. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to
characterize system behavior under a range of parameters. These results offer
insights into the feasibility of the optimization problem, the structure of
near-optimal actions, and the fundamental trade-offs between AoI, CAE, and the
costs involved.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应源信道编码（ASCC）方案，用于语义通信（SemComs），通过结合深度神经网络（DNN）的语义源编码和传统数字信道编码，解决了现有联合源信道编码（JSCC）与现有系统不兼容且无法适应源或信道变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义通信中的JSCC与现有通信系统不兼容且无法适应源或信道变化，而分离源信道编码（SSCC）在有限块长下表现不佳。

Method: 提出ASCC方案，通过逻辑回归近似端到端（E2E）失真与源编码率和误码率（BER）的关系，并建模BER与信噪比（SNR）和信道编码率的关系，最后通过逐次凸逼近解决优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，ASCC在单信道和平行信道场景下均优于典型的深度JSCC和SSCC方案，同时保持与实用数字系统的完全兼容性。

Conclusion: ASCC方案有效解决了语义通信中JSCC和SSCC的局限性，为实际系统提供了一种高效的编码方法。

Abstract: Semantic communications (SemComs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for
joint data and task-oriented transmissions, combining the demands for both the
bit-accurate delivery and end-to-end (E2E) distortion minimization. However,
current joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with
the existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the
sources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is
suboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we
propose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over
parallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic
source coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed
and adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and
channel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as
functions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic
regression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E
distortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power
allocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex
approximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC
scheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and
parallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical
digital systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a random modulation technique that is decoupled from
the channel matrix, allowing it to be applied to arbitrary norm-bounded and
spectrally convergent channel matrices. The proposed random modulation
constructs an equivalent dense and random channel matrix, ensuring that the
signals undergo sufficient statistical channel fading. It also guarantees the
asymptotic replica maximum a posteriori (MAP) bit-error rate (BER) optimality
of approximate message passing (AMP)-type detectors for linear systems with
arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices when their
state evolution has a unique fixed point. Then, a low-complexity cross-domain
memory approximate message passing (CD-MAMP) detector is proposed for random
modulation, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the
randomness of the random transform-domain channel. Furthermore, the optimal
power allocation schemes are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and
maximize the replica constrained capacity of random-modulated linear systems,
assuming the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the
transceiver. Numerical results show that the proposed random modulation can
achieve BER and block-error rate (BLER) performance gains of up to 2 - 3 dB
compared to existing OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with 5G-NR LDPC codes, under both average
and optimized power allocation.

### [16] [A Completely Blind Channel Estimation Technique for OFDM Using Generalized Constellation Splitting and Modified Phase-Directed Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06508)
*Sameera Bharadwaja H.,D. K. Mehra*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决SISO-OFDM系统中盲信道估计问题的算法，通过广义星座分裂和改进的相位导向算法解决了传统SOS方法的复数标量估计模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SOS的盲信道估计方法存在复数标量估计模糊问题，需依赖导频符号，违背了盲方法的初衷。

Method: 提出了一种结合广义星座分裂和改进的相位导向算法的盲方法，无需导频符号即可解决模糊问题。

Result: 通过MATLAB仿真验证了所提算法的性能。

Conclusion: 新算法成功解决了传统方法的模糊问题，同时保持了盲方法的优势。

Abstract: The problem of blind channel estimation for SISO-OFDM systems using
second-order statistics (SOS) is addressed. A comparison of two prominent
SOS-based techniques: subspace-decomposition and precoding-induced
correlation-averaging techniques in terms of MSE performance is presented. The
drawback of these methods is that they suffer from a complex-scalar estimation
ambiguity which is resolved by using pilots or reference symbols. By using
pilots the whole purpose of blind techniques is contradicted. We propose an
algorithm to resolve this ambiguity in blind manner using generalized
constellation-splitting and modified phase-directed algorithm. The performance
of the proposed scheme is evaluated via numerical simulations in MATLAB
environment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用GPU加速的直接地理定位方法，以解决低地球轨道卫星接收器在GNSS干扰检测中的高计算负担问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，GNSS干扰急剧增加，而现有接收器缺乏有效防御措施，低地球轨道卫星为干扰检测提供了机会，但传统直接地理定位方法计算负担过重。

Method: 通过利用位置域相关性在候选点和时间步上的独立性，将计算任务并行化于GPU上，实现高效地理定位。

Result: GPU加速的直接地理定位相比传统CPU处理显著提升了计算效率。

Conclusion: GPU并行计算是解决直接地理定位高计算需求的有效方法，适用于低地球轨道卫星的GNSS干扰检测。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in Global Navigation
Satellite Systems (GNSS) interference, which has proven to be problematic in
GNSS-dependent civilian applications. Many currently deployed GNSS receivers
lack the proper countermeasures to defend themselves against interference,
prompting the need for alternative defenses. Satellites in Low Earth Orbit
(LEO) provide an opportunity for GNSS interference detection, classification,
and localization. The direct geolocation approach has been shown to be
well-suited for low SNR regimes and in cases limited to short captures --
exactly what is expected for receivers in LEO. Direct geolocation is a
single-step search over a geographical grid that enables estimation of the
transmitter location directly from correlating raw observed signals. However, a
key limitation to this approach is the computational requirements. This
computational burden is compounded for LEO-based receivers as the geographic
search space is extensive. This paper alleviates the computational burden of
direct geolocation by exploiting the independence of position-domain
correlation across candidate points and time steps: nearly all computation can
be accomplished in parallel on a graphics processing unit (GPU). This paper
presents and evaluates the performance of GPU-accelerated direct geolocation
compared to traditional CPU processing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中，现有PLA方案需要攻击者的先验信道信息，导致性能下降。

Result: 仿真验证HVAE在静态和移动IIoT场景下优于其他方案。

Conclusion: HVAE在少量训练数据下仍能实现高性能认证。

Abstract: Recently, Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) has attracted much attention
since it takes advantage of the channel randomness nature of transmission media
to achieve communication confidentiality and authentication. In the complex
environment, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), machine learning
(ML) is widely employed with PLA to extract and analyze complex channel
characteristics for identity authentication. However, most PLA schemes for IIoT
require attackers' prior channel information, leading to severe performance
degradation when the source of the received signals is unknown in the training
stage. Thus, a channel impulse response (CIR)-based PLA scheme named
"Hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoder (HVAE)" for IIoT is proposed in this
article, aiming at achieving high authentication performance without knowing
attackers' prior channel information even when trained on a few data in the
complex environment. HVAE consists of an Auto-Encoder (AE) module for CIR
characteristics extraction and a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) module for
improving the representation ability of the CIR characteristic and outputting
the authentication results. Besides, a new objective function is constructed in
which both the single-peak and the double-peak Gaussian distribution are taken
into consideration in the VAE module. Moreover, the simulations are conducted
under the static and mobile IIoT scenario, which verify the superiority of the
proposed HVAE over three comparison PLA schemes even with a few training data.

Motivation: 在认知和智能无线电系统中，AMC的准确性至关重要，但异构无线信道条件（如Rayleigh和Rician衰落）对传统模型的泛化能力提出了挑战。

Method: 采用域对抗神经网络（DANN）框架，显式地减少源域和目标域之间的信道引起的分布偏移。

Result: 在模拟数据集上，DANN模型在某些调制方案中比基线模型绝对准确率提高了14.93%。

Conclusion: DANN在AMC任务中具有工程可行性，为自适应频谱智能的未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) plays a significant role in modern
cognitive and intelligent radio systems, where accurate identification of
modulation is crucial for adaptive communication. The presence of heterogeneous
wireless channel conditions, such as Rayleigh and Rician fading, poses
significant challenges to the generalization ability of conventional AMC
models. In this work, a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) based deep
learning framework is proposed that explicitly mitigates channel-induced
distribution shifts between source and target domains. The approach is
evaluated using a comprehensive simulated dataset containing five modulation
schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM) across Rayleigh and Rician fading
channels at five frequency bands. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the
DANN-based model achieves up to 14.93% absolute accuracy improvement in certain
modulation cases compared to a baseline supervised model trained solely on the
source domain. The findings establish the engineering feasibility of domain
adversarial learning in AMC tasks under real-world channel variability and
offer a robust direction for future research in adaptive spectrum intelligence

Conclusion: MA与RIS协同优化可显著提升系统安全性和传输效率，为未来无线通信提供新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission
scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided cell-free symbiotic
radio (SR) system. Specifically, the MAs deployed at distributed access points
(APs) work collaboratively with the RIS to establish high-quality propagation
links for both primary and secondary transmissions, as well as suppressing the
risk of eavesdropping on confidential primary information. We consider both
continuous and discrete MA position cases and maximize the secrecy rate of
primary transmission under the secondary transmission constraints,
respectively. For the continuous position case, we propose a two-layer
iterative optimization method based on differential evolution with one-in-one
representation (DEO), to find a high-quality solution with relatively moderate
computational complexity. For the discrete position case, we first extend the
DEO based iterative framework by introducing the mapping and determination
operations to handle the characteristic of discrete MA positions. To further
reduce the computational complexity, we then design an alternating optimization
(AO) iterative framework to solve all variables within a single layer. In
particular, we develop an efficient strategy to derive the sub-optimal solution
for the discrete MA positions, superseding the DEO-based method. Numerical
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed MA empowered secure
transmission scheme along with its optimization algorithms.

Abstract: 6G networks will need to support higher data rates, high-precision
localization, and imaging capabilities. Near-field technologies, enabled by
extremely large-scale (XL)-arrays, are expected to be essential physical-layer
solutions to meet these ambitious requirements. However, implementing XL-array
systems using traditional fully-digital or hybrid analog/digital architectures
poses significant challenges due to high power consumption and implementation
costs. Emerging XL-dynamic metasurface antennas (XL-DMAs) provide a promising
alternative, enabling ultra-low power and cost-efficient solutions, making them
ideal candidates for 6G near-field networks. In this article, we discuss the
opportunities and challenges of XL-DMAs employed in 6G near-field networks. We
first outline the fundamental principles of XL-DMAs and present the specifics
of the near-field model of XL-DMAs. We then highlight several promising
applications that might benefit from XL-DMAs, including near-field
communication, localization, and imaging. Finally, we discuss several open
problems and potential future directions that should be addressed to fully
exploit the capabilities of XL-DMAs in the next 6G near-field networks.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) positioning has emerged as a promising technology
for next-generation intelligent systems. The advent of reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) has revolutionized high-precision mmWave
localization by enabling dynamic manipulation of wireless propagation
environments. This paper investigates a three-dimensional (3D) multi-input
single-output (MISO) mmWave positioning system assisted by multiple RISs. We
introduce a measurement framework incorporating sequential RIS activation and
directional beamforming to fully exploit virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) paths.
The theoretical performance limits are rigorously analyzed through derivation
of the Fisher information and subsequent positioning error bound (PEB). To
minimize the PEB, two distinct optimization approaches are proposed for
continuous and discrete phase shift configurations of RISs. For continuous
phase shifts, a Riemannian manifold-based optimization algorithm is proposed.
For discrete phase shifts, a heuristic algorithm incorporating the grey wolf
optimizer is proposed. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in reducing the PEB and validate the
improvement in positioning accuracy achieved by multiple RISs.

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel downlink symbiotic radio (SR) framework
empowered by the pinching antenna system (PASS), aiming to enhance both primary
and secondary transmissions through reconfigurable antenna positioning. PASS
consists of multiple waveguides equipped with numerous low-cost pinching
antennas (PAs), whose positions can be flexibly adjusted to simultaneously
manipulate large-scale path loss and signal phases.We formulate a joint
transmit and pinching beamforming optimization problem to maximize the
achievable sum rate while satisfying the detection error probability constraint
for the IR and the feasible deployment region constraints for the PAs. This
problem is inherently nonconvex and highly coupled. To address it, two solution
strategies are developed. 1) A learning-aided gradient descent (LGD) algorithm
is proposed, where the constrained problem is reformulated into a
differentiable form and solved through end-to-end learning based on the
principle of gradient descent. The PA position matrix is reparameterized to
inherently satisfy minimum spacing constraints, while transmit power and
waveguide length limits are enforced via projection and normalization. 2) A
two-stage optimization-based approach is designed, in which the transmit
beamforming is first optimized via successive convex approximation (SCA),
followed by pinching beamforming optimization using a particle swarm
optimization (PSO) search over candidate PA placements. The SCA-PSO algorithm
achieves performance close to that of the element-wise method while
significantly reducing computational complexity by exploring a randomly
generated effective solution subspace, while further improving upon the LGD
method by avoiding undesirable local optima.

Abstract: The problem of super-resolution compressive sensing (SR-CS) is crucial for
various wireless sensing and communication applications. Existing methods often
suffer from limited resolution capabilities and sensitivity to
hyper-parameters, hindering their ability to accurately recover sparse signals
when the grid parameters do not lie precisely on a fixed grid and are close to
each other. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel robust
super-resolution compressive sensing algorithmic framework using a
two-timescale alternating maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. At the slow
timescale, the proposed framework iterates between a sparse signal estimation
module and a grid update module. In the sparse signal estimation module, a
hyperbolic-tangent prior distribution based variational Bayesian inference
(tanh-VBI) algorithm with a strong sparsity promotion capability is adopted to
estimate the posterior probability of the sparse vector and accurately identify
active grid components carrying primary energy under a dense grid.
Subsequently, the grid update module utilizes the BFGS algorithm to refine
these low-dimensional active grid components at a faster timescale to achieve
super-resolution estimation of the grid parameters with a low computational
cost. The proposed scheme is applied to the channel extrapolation problem, and
simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared
to baseline schemes.

Motivation: 现有文献常忽略波导内衰减以简化设计，但其对系统性能的影响尚未充分研究，尤其是在非理想视距条件下。

Method: 通过分析单用户和多用户场景，推导了波导内衰减对数据速率的影响，并提出动态样本平均逼近算法优化天线位置和波束成形。

Conclusion: 波导内衰减在典型条件下影响有限，动态算法能有效优化夹持天线系统性能，尤其在视距阻塞严重的环境中。

Abstract: In the literature of pinching-antenna systems, in-waveguide attenuation is
often neglected to simplify system design and enable more tractable analysis.
However, its effect on overall system performance has received limited
attention in the existing literature. While a recent study has shown that, in
line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated environments, the data rate loss incurred by
omitting in-waveguide attenuation is negligible when the communication area is
not excessively large, its effect under more general conditions remains
unclear. This work extends the analysis to more realistic scenarios involving
arbitrary levels of LoS blockage. We begin by examining a single-user case and
derive an explicit expression for the average data rate loss caused by
neglecting in-waveguide attenuation. The results demonstrate that, even for
large service areas, the rate loss remains negligible under typical LoS
blockage conditions. We then consider a more general multi-user scenario, where
multiple pinching antennas, each deployed on a separate waveguide, jointly
serve multiple users. The objective is to maximize the average sum rate by
jointly optimize antenna positions and transmit beamformers to maximize the
average sum rate under probabilistic LoS blockage. To solve the resulting
stochastic and nonconvex optimization problem, we propose a dynamic sample
average approximation (SAA) algorithm. At each iteration, this method replaces
the expected objective with an empirical average computed from dynamically
regenerated random channel realizations, ensuring that the optimization
accurately reflects the current antenna configuration. Extensive simulation
results are provided to the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the substantial
performance gains of pinching-antenna systems, particularly in environments
with significant LoS blockage.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种低复杂度的频域均衡方法用于Zak-OTFS调制，解决了传统OFDM在移动性下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM在多普勒扩展下性能下降，Zak-OTFS虽对双选择性信道鲁棒，但均衡复杂度高。

Method: 提出频域均衡方法，证明其与延迟-多普勒域模型等价，利用共轭梯度法降低复杂度。

Result: 频域均衡复杂度与帧维度线性相关，性能与延迟-多普勒域均衡相当。

Conclusion: 频域均衡为Zak-OTFS提供了一种高效且性能接近的解决方案。

Abstract: 4G/5G wireless standards use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) which is robust to frequency selectivity. Equalization is possible with
a single tap filter, and low-complexity equalization makes OFDM an attractive
physical layer. However the performance of OFDM degrades with mobility, since
Doppler spreads introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) between subcarriers
and they are no longer orthogonal. Zak-transform based orthogonal time
frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to be robust to doubly
selective channels. Zak-OTFS signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD)
domain, converted to time domain (TD) for transmission and reception, then
returned to the DD domain for processing. The received signal is a
superposition of many attenuated copies since the doubly selective channel
introduces delay and Doppler shifts. The received symbols are more difficult to
equalize since they are subject to interference along both delay and Doppler
axes. In this paper, we propose a new low-complexity method of equalizing
Zak-OTFS in the frequency domain (FD). We derive the FD system model and show
that it is unitarily equivalent to the DD system model. We show that the
channel matrix in the FD is banded, making it possible to apply conjugate
gradient methods to reduce the complexity of equalization. We show that
complexity of FD equalization is linear in the dimension of a Zak-OTFS frame.
For comparison the complexity of naive MMSE equalization is cubic in the frame
dimension. Through numerical simulations we show that FD equalization of
Zak-OTFS achieves similar performance as equalization in DD domain.

Result: 在双选择性信道下，VOCDM表现出优越的多样性性能，只要参数M和N满足信道延迟和多普勒扩展的约束。PAPR随N减小而降低。

Conclusion: VOCDM在双选择性信道中具有优越性能，参数M和N需合理配置以满足信道条件，同时PAPR可通过调整N优化。

Abstract: In this letter, we extend orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) to
vector OCDM (VOCDM) to provide more design freedom to deal with doubly
selective channels. The VOCDM modulation is implemented by performing M
parallel N-size inverse discrete Fresnel transforms (IDFnT). Based on the
complex exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) for doubly selective
channels, we derive the VOCDM input-output relationship, and show performance
tradeoffs of VOCDM with respect to (w.r.t.) its modulation parameters M and N.
Specifically, we investigate the diversity and peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) of VOCDM w.r.t. M and N. Under doubly selective channels, VOCDM exhibits
superior diversity performance as long as the parameters M and N are configured
to satisfy some constraints from the delay and the Doppler spreads of the
channel, respectively. Furthermore, the PAPR of VOCDM signals decreases with a
decreasing N. These theoretical findings are verified through numerical
simulations.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted integrated sensing and
communication (RIS-ISAC) presents a promising system architecture to leverage
the wide bandwidth available at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, while
mitigating severe signal propagation losses and reducing infrastructure costs.
To enhance ISAC functionalities in the future air-ground integrated network
applications, RIS deployment must be carefully designed and evaluated, which
forms the core motivation of this paper. To ensure practical relevance, a
multi-RIS-ISAC system is established, with its signal model at mmWave
frequencies demonstrated using ray-launching calibrated to real-world
environments. On this basis, an energy-efficiency-driven optimization problem
is formulated to minimize the multi-RIS size-to-coverage sum ratio,
comprehensively considering real-world RIS deployment constraints, positions,
orientations, as well as ISAC beamforming strategies at both the base station
and the RISs. To solve the resulting non-convex mixed-integer problem, a
simplified reformulation based on equivalent gain scaling method is introduced.
A two-step iterative algorithm is then proposed, in which the deployment
parameters are determined under fixed RIS positions in the first step, and the
RIS position set is updated in the second step to progressively approach the
optimum solution. Simulation results based on realistic parameter benchmarks
present that the optimized RISs deployment significantly enhances communication
coverage and sensing accuracy with the minimum RIS sizes, outperforming

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ViT的语义通信框架IA-QSMPA，通过注意力机制优化量化、子载波映射和功率分配，显著提升了任务性能和通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MIMO-OFDM系统中语义通信的资源分配问题，利用ViT提取重要性信息以优化性能。

Method: 结合ViT的注意力机制，提出IA-QSMPA框架，采用块坐标下降算法解决非凸优化问题，并扩展至有限块长传输场景。

Result: 在MVP-N数据集的多视图图像分类任务中，IA-QSMPA在理想和有限块长传输场景下均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IA-QSMPA框架有效提升了语义通信的任务性能和资源利用效率，尤其在复杂传输条件下表现突出。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel importance-aware quantization, subcarrier
mapping, and power allocation (IA-QSMPA) framework for semantic communication
in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) systems, empowered by a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT). The
proposed framework exploits attention-based importance extracted from a
pretrained ViT to jointly optimize quantization levels, subcarrier mapping, and
power allocation. Specifically, IA-QSMPA maps semantically important features
to high-quality subchannels and allocates resources in accordance with their
contribution to task performance and communication latency. To efficiently
solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, a block coordinate descent
algorithm is employed. The framework is further extended to operate under
finite blocklength transmission, where communication errors may occur. In this
setting, a segment-wise linear approximation of the channel dispersion penalty
is introduced to enable efficient joint optimization under practical
constraints. Simulation results on a multi-view image classification task using
the MVP-N dataset demonstrate that IA-QSMPA significantly outperforms
conventional methods in both ideal and finite blocklength transmission
scenarios, achieving superior task performance and communication efficiency.

Conclusion: 无监督机器学习方法为RIS配置提供了一种高效且无需显式信道估计的解决方案。

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is considered as a key enabler
of the next-generation mobile radio systems. While attracting extensive
interest from academia and industry due to its passive nature and low cost,
scalability of RIS elements and requirement for channel state information (CSI)
are two major difficulties for the RIS to become a reality. In this work, we
introduce an unsupervised machine learning (ML) enabled optimization approach
to configure the RIS. The dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet is
combined with an implicit channel estimation method. The RISnet learns to map
from received pilot signals to RIS configuration directly without explicit
channel estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms baselines significantly.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合学习框架，用于在信道状态信息（CSI）不确定的情况下实现拜占庭容错的频谱感知和安全智能反射面（IRS）辅助的机会接入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在存在拜占庭用户和CSI不确定性时，如何实现高精度的频谱感知和安全通信的问题。

Method: 采用对数域贝叶斯更新与修剪聚合和注意力加权共识的频谱感知方法，基站通过保守最小规则融合网络信念。在感知结果基础上，通过最小化和均方误差（MSE）优化下行链路设计，联合优化基站预编码器、IRS相位偏移和用户均衡器。

Result: 在多种网络条件下，实现了更高的检测概率、更低的MSE、更强的窃听信号抑制和快速收敛。

Conclusion: 该框架为适应CSI可用性并通过联合学习协调感知与传输的安全机会通信提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose a joint learning framework for Byzantine-resilient spectrum
sensing and secure intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)--assisted opportunistic
access under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty. The sensing stage
performs logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation and
attention-weighted consensus, and the base station (BS) fuses network beliefs
with a conservative minimum rule, preserving detection accuracy under a bounded
number of Byzantine users. Conditioned on the sensing outcome, we pose downlink
design as sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization under transmit-power and
signal-leakage constraints and jointly optimize the BS precoder, IRS phase
shifts, and user equalizers. With partial (or known) CSI, we develop an
augmented-Lagrangian alternating algorithm with projected updates and provide
provable sublinear convergence, with accelerated rates under mild local
curvature. With unknown CSI, we perform constrained Bayesian optimization (BO)
in a geometry-aware low-dimensional latent space using Gaussian process (GP)
surrogates; we prove regret bounds for a constrained upper confidence bound
(UCB) variant of the BO module, and demonstrate strong empirical performance of
the implemented procedure. Simulations across diverse network conditions show
higher detection probability at fixed false-alarm rate under adversarial
attacks, large reductions in sum MSE for honest users, strong suppression of
eavesdropper signal power, and fast convergence. The framework offers a
practical path to secure opportunistic communication that adapts to CSI
availability while coherently coordinating sensing and transmission through
joint learning.

Conclusion: 首次利用静态EMS增强信道制图（CC），在挑战性NLoS条件下实现显著定位性能提升。

Abstract: This paper introduces the use of static electromagnetic skins (EMSs) to
enable robust device localization via channel charting (CC) in realistic urban
environments. We develop a rigorous optimization framework that leverages EMS
to enhance channel dissimilarity and spatial fingerprinting, formulating EMS
phase profile design as a codebook-based problem targeting the upper quantiles
of key embedding metric, localization error, trustworthiness, and continuity.
Through 3D ray-traced simulations of a representative city scenario, we
demonstrate that optimized EMS configurations, in addition to significant
improvement of the average positioning error, reduce the 90th-percentile
localization error from over 60 m (no EMS) to less than 25 m, while drastically
improving trustworthiness and continuity. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to exploit Smart Radio Environment (SRE) with static EMS for
enhancing CC, achieving substantial gains in localization performance under
challenging None-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions.

Abstract: Hydraulic systems have been one of the most used technologies in many
industries due to their reliance on incompressible fluids that facilitate
energy and power transfer. Within such systems, hydraulic cylinders are prime
devices that convert hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. Some of the
genuine and very common problems related to hydraulic cylinders are leakages.
Leakage in hydraulic systems can cause a drop in pressure, general
inefficiency, and even complete failure of such systems. The various ways
leakage can occur define the major categorization of leakage: internal and
external leakage. External leakage is easily noticeable, while internal
leakage, which involves fluid movement between pressure chambers, can be harder
to detect and may gradually impact system performance without obvious signs.
When leakage surpasses acceptable limits, it is classified as a fault or
failure. In such cases, leakage is divided into three categories: no leakage,
low leakage, and high leakage. It suggests a fault detection algorithm with the
basic responsibility of detecting minimum leakage within the Hydraulic system,
and minimizing detection time is the core idea of this paper. In order to fully
develop this idea, experimental data collection of Hydraulic systems is
required. The collected data uses pressure sensors and other signals that are
single-related. Due to the utilization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
recurrent neural networks, more complex data analysis was enabled, which the
LSTM-based leakage detection algorithm successfully achieved, providing almost
96% accuracy in classifying leakage types. Results demonstrate that the
proposed method can perform real-time and online fault diagnosis for each
cycle, reducing maintenance costs and prolonging the hydraulic system's
lifespan.

Motivation: 随着安全功能需求的增加，需要解决两个近距离目标的角度估计问题。

Method: 研究了FFT、MUSIC和压缩感知算法在角度估计任务中的表现。

Result: FFT速度最快但角度分辨率较差，而MUSIC和压缩感知是超分辨率算法。

Conclusion: MUSIC和压缩感知在角度估计任务中表现优于FFT。

Abstract: The FMCW radars are widely used for automotive radar systems. The basic idea
for FMCW radars is to generate a linear frequency ramp as transmit signal. The
difference frequency, (i.e., beat frequency) between the transmitted and
received signal is determined after down conversion. The FFT operation on beat
frequency signal can recognize targets at different range and velocity.
Increasing demand on safety functionality leads to the Direction of Arrival
(DOA) estimation to resolve two closely located targets. Consequently, the
problem of angle estimation for 77GHz FMCW automotive radar simulated data has
been investigated in this term project. In particular, we examined the
performances of FFT, MUSIC and compressed sensing in angle estimation task, and
it was found that although FFT is the fastest algorithm, it has very poor
angular resolution when compared with others which are both super resolution
algorithms. The code for this project report is available at

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) present a breakthrough among the
flexible-antenna technologies, and distinguish themselves by facilitating
large-scale antenna reconfiguration, line-of-sight creation, scalable
implementation, and near-field benefits, thus bringing wireless communications
from the last mile to the last meter. A comprehensive tutorial is presented in
this paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS
signal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna
activation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity
limits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance
metrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its
superiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching
beamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is
first characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general
multiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for
PASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS,
namely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical
protocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications,
namely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A
possible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further
highlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is
elaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity
and suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based
approaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also
explored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training
algorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation
wireless networks are highlighted.

Conclusion: Remote ID在无人机碰撞避免中具有潜力，优化通信协议配置可显著提升性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is
paramount to ensure safe and efficient operations in open airspaces. The remote
identification (Remote ID) is deemed an effective real-time UAV monitoring
system by the federal aviation administration, which holds potentials for
enabling inter-UAV communications. This paper deeply investigates the
application of Remote ID for UAV collision avoidance while minimizing
communication delays. First, we propose a Remote ID based distributed multi-UAV
collision avoidance (DMUCA) framework to support the collision detection,
avoidance decision-making, and trajectory recovery. Next, the average
transmission delays for Remote ID messages are analyzed, incorporating the
packet reception mechanisms and packet loss due to interference. The
optimization problem is formulated to minimize the long-term average
communication delay, where UAVs can flexibly select the Remote ID protocol to
enhance the collision avoidance performance. To tackle the problem, we design a
multi-agent deep Q-network based adaptive communication configuration
algorithm, allowing UAVs to autonomously learn the optimal protocol
configurations in dynamic environments. Finally, numerical results verify the
feasibility of the proposed DMUCA framework, and the proposed mechanism can
reduce the average delay by 32% compared to the fixed protocol configuration.

Motivation: 传统视觉方法在低光照、有限视角和遮挡等条件下表现不佳，因此需要结合触觉信号来提升重建质量。

Method: 采用两阶段采样方案：先探测稀疏区域，再聚焦于高不确定性边界；提出几何损失函数以确保表面平滑。

Result: 实验表明，几何精度显著提升，在严重遮挡情况下，Chamfer Distance降低了15倍以上。

Conclusion: 触觉信号的集成显著提升了3D高斯泼溅的重建效果，且方法完全在线，适用于视觉退化环境。

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that integrates touch signals
(contact points and surface normals) into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our
approach enhances scene reconstruction, particularly under challenging
conditions like low lighting, limited camera viewpoints, and occlusions.
Different from the visual-only method, the proposed approach incorporates
spatially selective touch measurements to refine both the geometry and
appearance of the 3D Gaussian representation. To guide the touch exploration,
we introduce a two-stage sampling scheme that initially probes sparse regions
and then concentrates on high-uncertainty boundaries identified from the
reconstructed mesh. A geometric loss is proposed to ensure surface smoothness,
resulting in improved geometry. Experimental results across diverse scenarios
show consistent improvements in geometric accuracy. In the most challenging
case with severe occlusion, the Chamfer Distance is reduced by over 15x,
demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating touch cues into 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Furthermore, our approach maintains a fully online pipeline,
underscoring its feasibility in visually degraded environments.

enabled ML, which exploit the domain expertise of communication systems to
design better approaches than general ML methods.

Abstract: This work explores the integration of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA),
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), and
beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) to enhance the
spectral-efficiency, energy-efficiency, coverage, and connectivity of future
sixth-generation (6G) communication networks. Specifically, with a multiuser
BD-RIS-empowered RSMA-SWIPT system, we jointly optimize the transmit precoding
vectors, the common rate proportion of users, the power-splitting ratios, and
scattering matrix of BD-RIS node, under the assumption of imperfect channel
state information (CSI). Additionally, to better capture practical hardware
behavior, we incorporate a nonlinear energy harvesting model under energy
harvesting constraints. We design a robust optimization framework to maximize
the system sum-rate, while explicitly accounting for the worst-case impact of
CSI uncertainties. Further, we introduce an alternating optimization framework
that partitions the problem into several blocks, which are optimized
iteratively. More specifically, the transmit precoding vectors are optimized by
reformulating the problem as a convex semidefinite programming through
successive-convex approximation (SCA), whereas the power-splitting problem is
solved using the MOSEK-enabled CVX toolbox. Subsequently, to optimize the
scattering matrix of the BD-RIS, we first employ SCA to reformulate the problem
into a convex form, and then design a manifold optimization strategy based on
the Conjugate-Gradient method. Finally, numerical simulation results reveal
that the proposed scheme provides significant performance improvements over
existing benchmarks and demonstrates rapid convergence within a reasonable
number of iterations.
