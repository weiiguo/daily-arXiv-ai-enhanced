To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM\" paradigm\nhas emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the\nchannel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,\nexisting adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To\naddress this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning\nrepresentations from the spectral components of CSI features can more\neffectively help bridge the domain gap.
