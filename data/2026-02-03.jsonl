However, conventional methods relying on Time-Frequency Analysis (TFA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face two fundamental limitations: severe performance degradation in low Jamming-to-Signal Ratio (JSR) regimes due to noise obscuration, and ``feature degeneracy'' caused by the loss of phase information in magnitude-only spectrograms. Consequently, spectrally similar signals -- such as high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation versus Band-Limited Gaussian Noise -- become indistinguishable. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the \\textbf{JSR-Guided Fusion Network (JSR-GFNet)}. This multi-modal architecture combines phase-sensitive complex In-Phase/Quadrature (IQ) samples with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms. Central to this framework is a physics-inspired dynamic gating mechanism driven by statistical signal descriptors. Acting as a conditional controller, it autonomously estimates signal reliability to dynamically reweight the contributions of a Complex-Valued ResNet (IQ stream) and an EfficientNet backbone (STFT stream). To validate the model, we introduce the Comprehensive GNSS Interference (CGI-21) dataset, simulating 21 jamming categories including software-defined waveforms from aerial platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JSR-GFNet achieves higher accuracy across the full 10--50 dB JSR spectrum. Notably, interpretability analysis confirms that the model learns a physically intuitive strategy: prioritizing spectral energy integration in noise-limited regimes while shifting focus to phase precision in high-SNR scenarios to resolve modulation ambiguities. This framework provides a robust solution for next-generation aerospace navigation security."}

Motivated by this contrast, recent work in mechanics has explored embedding information-processing capabilities directly into mechanical structures. However, quantitative frameworks for evaluating such capabilities remain limited. Here we address a foundational question: how does information propagate through a solid body? Using elastic bodies as a model system, we apply information-theoretic tools to treat an elastic domain as an information encoder and quantify how information transmits from applied loads to discrete sensor locations. We further connect these measures to familiar mechanical phenomena, including Saint-Venant's effect and principal stress lines. Moving toward design, we show how geometry and architected materials can tune transmission, enabling elastic domains to either transmit or block information. Overall, this work advances quantifiable metrics and benchmark tasks for mechanical intelligence, supporting comparable designs of mechanically embodied information processing."}

This paper presents a sub-band full-duplex (SBFD) ISAC system that assigns non-overlapping OFDM subbands to sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous operation with minimal interference. A distributed testbed with three SIMO nodes is implemented using USRP X410 devices operating at 6.8 GHz with 20 MHz bandwidth per channel. A total of 2048 OFDM subcarriers are partitioned into three subbands: two for sensing using Zadoff-Chu sequences and one for communication using QPSK. Each USRP transmits one subband while receiving signals across all three, forming a 1 x 3 SIMO node. Time synchronization is achieved through host-server coordination without external clock distribution. Indoor measurements, validated against MOCAP ground truth, confirm the feasibility of the SBFD ISAC system. The results demonstrate monostatic sensing with a velocity resolution of 0.145 m/s, and communication under NLoS conditions with a BER of 3.63e-3. Compared with a multiband benchmark requiring three times more spectrum, the SBFD configuration achieves comparable velocity estimation accuracy while conserving resources. The sensing and communication performance trade-off is determined by subcarrier allocation strategy rather than mutual interference."}

However, with the increasing number of UAVs and explosive wireless data, the existing bit-oriented communication network has approached the Shannon capacity, which cannot satisfy the quality of service (QoS) with ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for command and control (C\\&C) transmission in bit-oriented UAV communication networks. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic-aware C\\&C transmission for multi-UAVs under limited wireless resources. Specifically, we leverage semantic similarity to measure the variation in C\\&C messages for each UAV over continuous transmission time intervals (TTIs) and capture the correlation of C\\&C messages among UAVs, enabling multicast transmission. Based on the semantic similarity and the importance of UAV commands, we design a trigger function to quantify the QoS of UAVs. Then, to maximize the long-term QoS and exploit multicast opportunities of C\\&C messages induced by semantic similarity, we develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to jointly determine the transmission mode (unicast/multicast/idle) and the allocation of limited resource blocks (RBs) between a base station (BS) and UAVs. Experimental results show that our proposed semantic-aware framework significantly increases transmission efficiency and improves effectiveness compared with bit-oriented UAV transmission."}

However, forwarding raw CSI from multiple BSs to a central unit (CU) incurs prohibitive fronthaul overhead, which limits scalable cooperative positioning in practice. This paper proposes a learning-based edge-cloud cooperative positioning framework under limited-capacity fronthaul constraints. In the proposed architecture, a neural network is deployed at each BS to compress the locally estimated CSI into a quantized representation subject to a fixed fronthaul payload. The quantized CSI is transmitted to the CU, which performs cooperative 3D positioning by jointly processing the compressed CSI received from multiple BSs. The proposed framework adopts a two-stage training strategy consisting of self-supervised local training at the BSs and end-to-end joint training for positioning at the CU. Simulation results based on a 3.5~GHz 5G NR compliant urban ray-tracing scenario with six BSs and 20~MHz bandwidth show that the proposed method achieves a mean 3D positioning error of 0.48~m and a 90th-percentile error of 0.83~m, while reducing the fronthaul payload to 6.25% of lossless CSI forwarding. The achieved performance is close to that of cooperative positioning with full CSI exchange."}

The CMA encoder injects a physically grounded prior--per-BS channel gain--into the attention weights, thus emphasizing reliable links and suppressing spurious multipath. A lightweight LSTM decoder then treats subcarriers as a sequence to accumulate frequency-domain evidence into a final 3D position estimate. In a typical 5G NR-compliant urban simulation, CMANet achieves less than 0.5m median error and 1.0m 90th-percentile error, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to statistically model the HQN, we construct as well as visualize the corresponding pointwise entropic functions in a given 3D probabilistic landscape. When integrated over the relevant state space, these entropic surfaces yield values of the respective global entropy. Through analytical and numerical evaluation, it is demonstrated that the differential entropy approaches the quantum collision entropy under certain mixing conditions, which aligns with the Renyi entropy for order $α= 2$. Within the HQC framework, the results establish a theoretical and computational equivalence between these measures. This provides a unified perspective on quantifying uncertainty in hybrid quantum communication systems.

Existing BLE direction finding datasets rarely provide tightly controlled, IQ-level paired LOS and NLOS measurements with rigorous statistical validation, and commonly used flat-fading models can be inadequate for cluttered indoor environments exhibiting heavy-tailed power distributions. To address these limitations, we conduct a paired-geometry BLE AoA measurement campaign using an off-the-shelf module, collecting 132000 labeled CTE packets under matched anchor-tag conditions. A robust preprocessing stage removes anomalous CTEs using combined univariate and multivariate criteria. Feature-wise hypothesis tests on IQ-derived power features confirm strong LOS and NLOS separability. All mean differences are statistically significant; additionally, 92 percent of feature-wise variance differences are significant. We further compute L-moment ratios (LMRs) and analyze them in the L-moment Ratio Diagram (LMRD), showing that NLOS subsets exhibit markedly heavier tails and stronger asymmetry than LOS. Kappa-family distributions fitted from LMRs provide substantially improved dual scored L--moment goodness-of-fit (GoF), Specifically, for NLOS, which is the smallest discrepancy in the LMRD and a near-zero standardized L-kurtosis deviation.

We compare the performance of IterativeFT against simple real domain and frequency domain thresholding, reduced rank reconstruction and locally adaptive network sparsification. Relative to the comparison network denoising approaches, the proposed IterativeFT method provides the best overall performance for lattice and Kuatz networks with competitive performance on tree and bipartite networks.

By replacing explicit field modeling with learning-based inference, the proposed approach captures nonlinear field interactions and environmental effects. An orientation-invariant feature representation enables rotation-independent deployment. The system is evaluated across multiple indoor environments and an outdoor deployment. Benchmarking against classical and deep learning baselines shows that a Random Forest regressor achieves sub-20 cm accuracy in 2D and sub-30 cm in 3D localization. Cross-environment validation demonstrates that models trained indoors generalize to outdoor environments without retraining. We further analyze scalability by varying transmitter spacing, showing that coverage and accuracy can be balanced through deployment density.

In this work, we study this question through the lens of robustness to distributional shifts at the channel output. We evaluate both input-dependent adversarial perturbations (FGM and projected gradient methods under $\\ell_2$ constraints) and universal adversarial perturbations that apply a single norm-bounded shift to all received vectors. Our results show that recent AI decoders, including ECCT and CrossMPT, could suffer significant performance degradation under such perturbations, despite superior nominal performance under i.i.d. AWGN. Moreover, adversarial perturbations transfer relatively strongly between AI decoders but weakly to BP-based decoders, and universal perturbations are substantially more harmful than random perturbations of equal norm.

Despite this flexibility, the high computational complexity and large parameter footprint of transformer-based decoders present substantial obstacles to practical deployment. To address these challenges, we investigate structured pruning for FECCT and propose Spectral-Aligned Pruning (SAP), a structure-aware framework that enables cross-code reuse of structured pruning masks across codes by leveraging the spectrum of the corresponding bipartite graph. After pruning, SAP performs per-code recovery via parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA), enabling a shared pruned backbone while storing only small code-specific adapter parameters. Experiments across diverse codes show that SAP achieves decoding performance comparable to dedicated per-code pruning, while enabling substantial reductions in computational cost and model memory footprint through kernel-level structured pruning."}

This paper focuses on the angle estimation performance with antenna arrays and tackles the critical challenge of array beam pattern calibration for ISAC systems. To assess calibration quality from a sensing perspective, a novel performance metric that accounts for angle estimation error, rather than beam pattern similarity, is proposed and incorporated into a differentiable loss function. Additionally, a cooperative calibration framework is introduced, allowing multiple user equipments to iteratively optimize the beam pattern based on the proposed loss functions and local data, and collaboratively update global calibration parameters. The proposed models and algorithms are validated using real-world beam pattern measurements collected in an anechoic chamber.

In a VQ-VAE-based semantic communication system, the transmission rate is directly governed by the size of a discrete codebook known as knowledge base (KB). However, the KB size is a fixed hyperparameter, meaning that adapting the rate requires training and storing a separate model for each desired size -- a practice that is too computationally and storage-prohibitive to achieve truly granular rate control. To address this, we introduce a principled, zero-shot KB resizing method that enables on-the-fly rate adaptation without any retraining. Our approach establishes a global importance ranking for all vectors within a single, large parent KB by uncovering its inherent semantic hierarchy. This is achieved via a three-step framework: 1) embedding KB vectors into hyperbolic space to reveal their hierarchical relationships; 2) constructing a master semantic tree using a minimum spanning tree algorithm; 3) enabling instant resizing by iteratively pruning the least important leaf nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method achieves reconstruction quality nearly identical to that of dedicated KBs trained from scratch, while demanding only a fraction of the computational budget. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior robustness at very low rates, where conventional KBs suffer from catastrophic failure. Our work resolves a fundamental limitation of VQ-VAE-based semantic communication systems, offering a practical and efficient path toward flexible and rate-adaptive semantic communication."}

To reduce the number of required light-emitting diodes (LEDs), advanced methods commonly exploit LED shape features for positioning. Although interesting, they are typically restricted to a single LED geometry, leading to failure in heterogeneous LED-shape scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper investigates Lamé curves as a unified representation of common LED shapes and proposes a generic VLP algorithm using Lamé curve-shaped LEDs, termed LC-VLP. In the considered system, multiple ceiling-mounted Lamé curve-shaped LEDs periodically broadcast their curve parameters via visible light communication, which are captured by a camera-equipped receiver. Based on the received LED images and curve parameters, the receiver can estimate the camera pose using LC-VLP. Specifically, an LED database is constructed offline to store the curve parameters, while online positioning is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem and solved iteratively. To provide a reliable initialization, a correspondence-free perspective-\\textit{n}-points (FreeP\\textit{n}P) algorithm is further developed, enabling approximate CPE without any pre-calibrated reference points. The performance of LC-VLP is verified by both simulations and experiments. Simulations show that LC-VLP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both circular- and rectangular-LED scenarios, achieving reductions of over 40% in position error and 25% in rotation error.

Each network specializes in executing a distinct type of task. Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes."}

This paper presents a unified framework to jointly characterise resolution and aliasing in NF localisation and study the trade-off between the two. Leveraging the concept of local chirp spatial frequency, we derive analytical expressions linking array geometry and sampling density to the spatial bandwidth of the received field. We introduce two geometric tools--Critical Antenna Elements (CAEs) and the Non-Contributive Zone (NCZ)--to intuitively identify how individual antennas contribute to resolution and/or aliasing.

A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \\emph{AgeTop-\\(k\\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \\(k\\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected.

Next, we mitigate channel effects by computing the reciprocal of the received signal in the frequency domain at the device under authentication. We then compare these methods across three different scenarios: the deterministic channel scenario, the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) stochastic channel scenario, and the non-i.i.d. stochastic channel scenario. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the silhouette score is an efficient metric to evaluate classification accuracy. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed precoding-based channel-robust RFF feature extraction method achieves the highest silhouette score and classification accuracy under channel variations."}

This research presents an in-situ EEG study on how digital interpretive content modulate engagement during art viewing. Participants experienced three modalities: direct viewing of a Bruegel painting, a 180° immersive interpretive projection, and a regular, display-based interpretive video. Frontal EEG markers of motivational orientation, internal involvement, perceptual drive, and arousal were extracted using eyes-open baselines and Z-normalized contrasts. Results show modality-specific engagement profiles: display-based interpretive video induced high arousal and fast-band activity, immersive projections promoted calm, presence-oriented absorption, and original artworks reflected internally regulated engagement. These findings, relying on lightweight EEG sensing in an operational cultural environment, suggest that digital interpretive content affects engagement style rather than quantity. This paves the way for new multimodal sensing approaches and enables museums to optimize the modalities and content of their interpretive media."}

Among various amodal sensing paradigms, wireless amodal sensing is a potential solution due to its advantages of environmental robustness, privacy preservation, and low cost. However, the sensing data obtained by wireless system is sparse for shape reconstruction because of the low spatial resolution, and this issue is further intensified in complex environments with occlusion. To address this issue, we propose a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless amodal sensing scheme that leverages a large-scale RIS to enhance the spatial resolution and create reflection paths that can bypass the obstacles. A generative learning model is also employed to reconstruct the complete shape based on the sensing data captured from the viewpoint of the RIS. In such a system, it is challenging to optimize the RIS phase shifts because the relationship between RIS phase shifts and amodal sensing accuracy is complex and the closed-form expression is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we develop an error prediction model that learns the mapping from RIS phase shifts to amodal sensing accuracy, and optimizes RIS phase shifts based on this mapping. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show that our method achieves at least a 56.73% reduction in reconstruction error compared to conventional schemes under the same number of RIS configurations."}

We present a camera-free 2D LiDAR object detection pipeline that encodes short-term temporal context by stacking three consecutive scans as RGB channels, yielding a compact YOLOv8n input without occupancy-grid construction while preserving angular structure and motion cues. Evaluated in Webots across 160 randomized indoor scenarios with strict scenario-level holdout, the method achieves 98.4% mAP@0.5 (0.778 mAP@0.5:0.95) with 94.9% precision and 94.7% recall on four object classes. On a Raspberry Pi 5, it runs in real time with a mean post-warm-up end-to-end latency of 47.8ms per frame, including scan encoding and postprocessing. Relative to a closely related occupancy-grid LiDAR-YOLO pipeline reported on the same platform, the proposed representation is associated with substantially lower reported end-to-end latency. Although results are simulation-based, they suggest that lightweight temporal encoding can enable accurate and real-time LiDAR-only detection for embedded indoor robotics without capturing RGB appearance."}

At inference, the least square (LS) estimate and estimation noise condition the DiT to recover the channel in a single forward pass, eliminating iterative sampling.

This paper also presents a Gaussian implementation of the T-IEMB filter, which performs the update by approximating the conditional moments of the measurement model, and admits a computationally light filtering solution.

However, with the increasing number of UAVs and explosive wireless data, the existing bit-oriented communication network has approached the Shannon capacity, which cannot satisfy the quality of service (QoS) with ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for command and control (C\\&C) transmission in bit-oriented UAV communication networks. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic-aware C\\&C transmission for multi-UAVs under limited wireless resources. Specifically, we leverage semantic similarity to measure the variation in C\\&C messages for each UAV over continuous transmission time intervals (TTIs) and capture the correlation of C\\&C messages among UAVs, enabling multicast transmission. Based on the semantic similarity and the importance of UAV commands, we design a trigger function to quantify the QoS of UAVs. Then, to maximize the long-term QoS and exploit multicast opportunities of C\\&C messages induced by semantic similarity, we develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to jointly determine the transmission mode (unicast/multicast/idle) and the allocation of limited resource blocks (RBs) between a base station (BS) and UAVs. Experimental results show that our proposed semantic-aware framework significantly increases transmission efficiency and improves effectiveness compared with bit-oriented UAV transmission."}

This paper investigates the integration of SIM into multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to enhance physical layer security. A novel system architecture is proposed, wherein each base station (BS) antenna transmits a dedicated single-user stream, while a multi-layer SIM executes wave-based beamforming in the electromagnetic domain, thereby avoiding the need for complex baseband digital precoding and significantly reducing hardware overhead. To maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR), we formulate a joint precoding optimization problem over BS power allocation and SIM phase shifts, which is high-dimensional and non-convex due to the complexity of the objective function and the coupling among optimization variables. To address this, we propose a manifold-enhanced heterogeneous multi-agent continual learning (MHACL) framework that incorporates gradient representation and dual-scale policy optimization to achieve robust performance in dynamic environments with high demands for secure communication. Furthermore, we develop SIM-MHACL (SIMHACL), a low-complexity learning template that embeds phase coordination into a product manifold structure, reducing the exponential search space to linear complexity while maintaining physical feasibility. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework achieves millisecond-level per-iteratio ntraining in SIM-assisted systems, significantly outperforming various baseline schemes, with SIMHACL achieving comparable WSSR to MHACL while reducing computation time by 30\\%."}

We propose an efficient \\emph{age-aware edge-blind over-the-air FL} approach that does not require channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Instead, the parameter server (PS) uses multiple antennas and applies maximum-ratio combining (MRC) based on its estimated sum of the channel gains to detect the parameter updates. A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \\emph{AgeTop-\\(k\\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \\(k\\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency. We provide a convergence bound that highlights the advantages of using a higher number of antenna array elements and demonstrates a key trade-off: increasing \\(k\\) decreases compression error at the cost of increasing the effect of channel noise. Experimental results show that (i) more PS antennas greatly improve accuracy and convergence speed; (ii) AgeTop-\\(k\\) outperforms random selection under relatively good channel conditions; and (iii) the optimum \\(k\\) depends on the channel, with smaller \\(k\\) being better in noisy settings."}
