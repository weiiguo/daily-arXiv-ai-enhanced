We characterize the achievable Stein exponent of this setup when the channel from the sensor to the decision center is a partially-connected discrete memoryless channel (DMC), i.e., when certain output symbols can only be induced by some of the inputs. The Stein-exponent in this case, does not depend on the specific transition law of the DMC and equals Shalaby and Papamarcou's exponent without a warden but where the sensor can send $k$ noise-free bits to the decision center, for $k$ a function that is sublinear in the observation length $n$. For fully-connected DMCs, we propose an achievable Stein-exponent and show that it can improve over the local exponent at the decision center. All our coding schemes do not require that the sensor and decision center share a common secret key, as commonly assumed in covert communication. Moreover, in our schemes the divergence covertness constraint vanishes (almost) exponentially fast in the obervation length $n$, again, an atypical behaviour for covert communication."}

Serving as the system orchestrator, the 6G-LLM drives a paradigm shift that fundamentally departs from existing rule-based approaches, which primarily rely on modular, experience-driven optimization. By contrast, the 6G-LLM substantially enhances network flexibility and adaptability. Nevertheless, current efforts to construct 6G-LLMs are constrained by their reliance on large-scale, meticulously curated, human-authored corpora, which are impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Moreover, purely offline-trained models lack the capacity for continual self-improvement, limiting their ability to adapt to the highly dynamic requirements of wireless communication environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel training paradigm termed RLDTF (Reinforcement Learning from Digital Twin Feedback) for 6G-LLMs. This framework leverages network digital twins to generate reward signals based on orchestration outcomes, while employing reinforcement learning to guide the model toward optimal decision-making dynamically. Furthermore, we introduce a weighted token mechanism to improve output accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in orchestration accuracy and solution optimality."}

Recently, microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) has emerged as a promising approach to realize beamforming entirely in the analog domain, thereby alleviating the scalability challenges associated with gigantic MIMO. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental beamforming flexibility and design of lossless and reciprocal MiLAC-aided beamforming for MU-MISO systems. We first provide a rigorous characterization of the set of beamforming matrices achievable by MiLAC. Based on this characterization, we prove that MiLAC-aided beamforming does not generally achieve the full flexibility of digital beamforming, while offering greater flexibility than conventional phase-shifter-based analog beamforming. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid digital-MiLAC architecture and show that it achieves digital beamforming flexibility when the number of radio frequency (RF) chains equals the number of data streams, halving that required by conventional hybrid beamforming. We then formulate the MiLAC-aided sum-rate maximization problem for MU-MISO systems. To solve the problem efficiently, we reformulate the MiLAC-related constraints as a convex linear matrix inequality and establish a low-dimensional subspace property that significantly reduces the problem dimension. Leveraging these results, we propose WMMSE-based algorithms for solving the resulting problem. Simulation results demonstrate that MiLAC-aided beamforming achieves performance close to that of digital beamforming in gigantic MIMO systems. Compared with hybrid beamforming, it achieves comparable or superior performance with lower hardware and computational complexity by avoiding symbol-level digital processing and enabling low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs)."}

Our star-graph scheme has a better rate than previously known schemes with low subpacketization for general star graphs. Our scheme for general graphs uses a decomposition of the graph via independent sets.

To address this challenge, various blind estimators that operate without pilot have been considered as potential solutions. However, these algorithms often involve a training phase for machine learning or a large number of iterations, which implies prohibitive computational complexity, making them difficult to employ for real-time services and the system less resilient to dynamic environment variation. In this paper, we propose blind estimators for average noise power, signal power, SNR, and mean-square error (MSE) that do not require knowledge of the ground-truth signal or involve high computational complexity.

It is worth noting that existing codebook designs for XL-MIMO, such as polar-domain codebook, have not well taken into account user (location) distribution in practice, thereby incurring excessive feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel and efficient feedback codebook tailored to user distribution. To this end, we first consider a typical scenario where users are uniformly distributed within a specific polar-region, based on which a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize angle-range samples and bit allocation among angle/range feedback. This problem is challenging to solve due to the lack of a closed-form expression for the received power in terms of angle and range samples. By leveraging a Voronoi partitioning approach, we show that uniform angle sampling is optimal for received power maximization. For more challenging range sampling design, we obtain a tight lower-bound on the received power and show that geometric sampling, where the ratio between adjacent samples is constant, can maximize the lower bound and thus serves as a high-quality suboptimal solution. We then extend the proposed framework to accommodate more general non-uniform user distribution via an alternating sampling method. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that as the array size increases, the optimal allocation of feedback bits increasingly favors range samples at the expense of angle samples. Finally, numerical results validate the superior rate performance and robustness of the proposed codebook design under various system setups, achieving significant gains over benchmark schemes, including the widely used polar-domain codebook."}

In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \\geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \\textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication."}

A major challenge in respect of the code construction is how to obtain such codes with the shortest possible length (or equivalently, the smallest possible circulant size) using algebraic methods instead of search methods. The greatest-common-divisor (GCD) framework we previously proposed has algebraically constructed QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 5 and 6, very short lengths, and a girth of 8. By introducing the concept of a mirror sequence and adopting a new row-regrouping scheme, QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 7 and 8, very short lengths, and a girth of 8 are proposed for arbitrary row weights in this article via an algebraic manner under the GCD framework. Thanks to these novel algebraic methods, the lower bounds (for column weights 7 and 8) on consecutive circulant sizes are both improved by asymptotically about 20%, compared with the existing benchmarks. Furthermore, these new constructions can also offer circulant sizes asymptotically about 25% smaller than the novel bounds."}

We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time."}

Under the constraints of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery strategies, many schemes achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF). However, for general parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, their subpacketizations increase exponentially with the number of users. We aim to design a MISO coded caching scheme that achieves a large sum-DoF with low subpacketization $F$. An interesting combinatorial structure, called the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), can be used to generate MISO coded caching schemes under these two strategies; moreover, all existing schemes with these strategies can be represented by the corresponding MAPDAs. In this paper, we study the case with $F=K$ (i.e., $F$ grows linearly with $K$) by investigating MAPDAs. Specifically, based on the framework of Latin squares, we transform the design of MAPDA with $F=K$ into the construction of a combinatorial structure called the $L$-half-sum disjoint packing (HSDP). It is worth noting that a $1$-HSDP is exactly the concept of NHSDP, which is used to generate the shared-link coded caching scheme with $F=K$. By constructing $L$-HSDPs, we obtain a class of new schemes with $F=K$. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses show that our $L$-HSDP schemes significantly reduce subpacketization compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, while only slightly sacrificing sum-DoF, and achieve both a higher sum-DoF and lower subpacketization than the existing schemes with linear subpacketization."}

It is worth noting that existing codebook designs for XL-MIMO, such as polar-domain codebook, have not well taken into account user (location) distribution in practice, thereby incurring excessive feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel and efficient feedback codebook tailored to user distribution. To this end, we first consider a typical scenario where users are uniformly distributed within a specific polar-region, based on which a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize angle-range samples and bit allocation among angle/range feedback. This problem is challenging to solve due to the lack of a closed-form expression for the received power in terms of angle and range samples. By leveraging a Voronoi partitioning approach, we show that uniform angle sampling is optimal for received power maximization. For more challenging range sampling design, we obtain a tight lower-bound on the received power and show that geometric sampling, where the ratio between adjacent samples is constant, can maximize the lower bound and thus serves as a high-quality suboptimal solution. We then extend the proposed framework to accommodate more general non-uniform user distribution via an alternating sampling method. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that as the array size increases, the optimal allocation of feedback bits increasingly favors range samples at the expense of angle samples. Finally, numerical results validate the superior rate performance and robustness of the proposed codebook design under various system setups, achieving significant gains over benchmark schemes, including the widely used polar-domain codebook."}

In the considered model, light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters perform semantic compression to reduce data size, which incurs additional computation overhead. The compressed semantic information is transmitted to the users for semantic inference using a shared knowledge base that requires periodic updates to ensure synchronization.

Then, we derive lower and upper bounds on the code size of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, which can naturally be extended to the case of multiple bursts. Finally, we present constructions of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs. Compared to the codes obtained by the syndrome compression technique, the resulting codes achieve significantly lower computational complexity."}

In particular, we consider a distributed computing setting involving $L$ users, each requesting a linearly separable function over $K$ basis subfunctions from a master node, who is assisted by $N$ distributed servers. At the core of this problem lies a fundamental tradeoff between communication and computation: each server can compute up to $M$ subfunctions, and each server can communicate linear combinations of their locally computed subfunctions outputs to at most $Δ$ users. The objective is to design a distributed computing scheme that reduces the communication cost (total amount of data from servers to users), and towards this, for any given $K$, $L$, $M$, and $Δ$, we propose a distributed computing scheme that jointly designs the task assignment and transmissions, and shows that the scheme achieves optimal performance in the real field under various conditions using a novel converse. We also characterize the performance of the scheme in the finite field using another converse based on counting arguments."}

Lalitha"], "title": "Basis-Spline Assisted Coded Computing: Strategies and Error Bounds", "comment": null, "summary": "Coded computing has become a key framework for reliable distributed computation over decentralized networks, effectively mitigating the impact of stragglers. Although there exists a wide range of coded computing methods to handle both polynomial and non-polynomial functions, computing methods for the latter class have received traction due its inherent challenges in reconstructing non-polynomial functions using a finite number of evaluations. Among them, the state-of-the-art method is Berrut Approximated coded computing, wherein Berrut interpolants, are used for approximating the non-polynomial function. However, since Berrut interpolants have global support characteristics, such methods are known to offer degraded accuracy when the number of stragglers is large. To address this challenge, we propose a coded computing framework based on cubic B-spline interpolation. In our approach, server-side function evaluations are reconstructed at the master node using B-splines, exploiting their local support and smoothness properties to enhance stability and accuracy. We provide a systematic methodology for integrating B-spline interpolation into coded computing and derive theoretical bounds on approximation error in terms of the number of servers and stragglers. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our framework significantly outperforms Berrut-based methods for various non-polynomial functions."}

In their work, Chandan et al. characterized the expressions for the rate-privacy trade-offs for these classes of WPIR schemes, under the mutual information leakage and maximal leakage metrics. Explicit achievable trade-offs for the same were also presented, which were shown to be competitive or better than prior WPIR schemes. However, the class-wise optimality of the reported trade-offs were unknown. In this work, we show that the explicit rate-privacy trade-offs reported for the Sun-Jafar-type schemes by Chandan et al. are optimal for the non-colluding and replicated setting. Furthermore, we prove the class-wise optimality for Banawan-Ulukus-type MDS-WPIR and Sun-Jafar-type $T$-colluding WPIR schemes, under threshold-constraints on the system parameters. When these threshold-constraints do not hold, we present counter-examples which show that even higher rates than those reported before can be achieved."}

Success is predicated on at least one decoder recovering the source within a maximum distortion constraint. We find that in the one-shot regime, utilizing disjoint codebooks at each decoder yields a codebook diversity gain, distinct from the channel diversity gain that may be expected when several decoders observe independent realizations of the channel's output but share the same codebook. Coding schemes are introduced that leverage this phenomenon, where first- and second-order achievability bounds are derived via an adaptation of the Poisson matching lemma (Li and Anantharam, 2021) which allows for multiple decoders using disjoint codebooks. We further propose a hybrid coding scheme that partitions decoders into groups to optimally balance codebook and channel diversity. Numerical results on the binary symmetric channel demonstrate that the hybrid approach outperforms strategies where the decoders' codebooks are either fully shared or disjoint."}

Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \\geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \\textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication."}

Deep neural networks are able to capture rich dependencies in data, offering a powerful means of estimating these probabilities and hence an avenue towards more effective compression algorithms. However, both compressor and decompressor must have exactly matching predictions; even small non-deterministic differences (which often happen with learned models due to hardware, software, or computation order) can lead to cascading decoding failures. In this paper, we formalize the problem of prediction mismatch in model-driven compression, and introduce Probability Matching Interval Coding (PMATIC), a model-agnostic algorithm that tolerates bounded prediction mismatch with low overhead. PMATIC works with the predicted probabilities, making it compatible as a drop-in replacement for the arithmetic encoder in model-driven compression tools. We show theoretical correctness and performance bounds for PMATIC, and validate these results on text data. These results confirm that, when paired an advanced prediction model, PMATIC is robust to prediction mismatch while achieving compression rates that out-perform standard modern compression tools."}

The scheme uses two decoder views linked by automorphisms of the polar transform and publicly draws the encoder at random from the corresponding automorphism group. This yields perfect receiver privacy at any finite blocklength, since the public encoder distribution is independent of the receiver's choice bit. Sender privacy is obtained asymptotically via channel polarization combined with privacy amplification. Because the construction deliberately injects randomness on selected bad bit-channels, we derive a relaxed reliability criterion and evaluate finite-blocklength performance. Finally, we characterize the polar-transform automorphisms as bit-level permutations of bit-channel indices, and exploit this structure to derive and optimize an achievable finite-blocklength OT rate."}

Guruswami and Wootters first proposed a linear repair scheme for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, showing that they can be repaired with lower bandwidth than the naive approach.

Specifically, we model the excitation and radiation properties of transceiver antennas using CMA to analyze the excitation and radiation properties of antennas. The CMA-based DoF analysis framework is established and the achievable DoF is derived. A characteristic mode optimization problem of antennas is then formulated to maximize the achievable DoF. A case study where the reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) antennas are deployed at the transceiver is investigated, and a CMA-based genetic algorithm is later proposed to solve the above problem. By changing the characteristic modes electric field and surface current distribution of RHS, the achievable DoF is enhanced. Full-wave simulation verifies the theoretical analysis on the the achievable DoF and shows that, via the reconfiguration of RHS based on the proposed algorithm, the achievable DoF is improved."}
