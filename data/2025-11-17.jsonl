This paper proposes to introduce emerging intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) technologies into SWIPT systems aiming at enhancing information transmission for information decoding receivers (IDRs) and improving receive power of EHRs. We consider to maximize the weighted sum-rate of IDRs via jointly optimizing the active and passive beamforming at the base station (BS) and IRS, respectively, as well as the positions of MAs, while guaranteeing the requirements of all EHRs. To tackle this challenging task due to the non-convexity of associated optimization, we develop an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimal mean square error (WMMSE), block coordinate descent (BCD), majorization-minimization (MM), and penalty duality decomposition (PDD) frameworks. Besides, we present a feasibility characterization method to examine the achievability of EHRs' requirements. Simulation results demonstrate the significant benefits of our proposed solutions.

First, a general physical model for the phenomenon that accounts for both polarization and surface dissipation losses is developed. Then, the unipolarized coupling kernel is characterized, revealing that polarization induces anisotropic coupling and invalidates the conventional half-wavelength spacing rule for coupling elimination. Next, the beamforming design problem for CAPAs with coupling is formulated as a functional optimization problem, leading to the derivation of optimal beamforming structures via the calculus of variations. To address the challenge of inverting the coupling kernel in the optimal structure, two methods are proposed: 1) the kernel approximation method, which yields a closed-form solution via wavenumber-domain transformation and GaussLegendre quadrature, and 2) the conjugate gradient method, which addresses an equivalent quadratic functional optimization problem iteratively. Furthermore, the optimal array gain and beampattern are analyzed at the large-aperture limit. Finally, the proposed continuous mutual coupling model is extended to spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs), and comprehensive numerical results are provided, demonstrating that: 1) coupled SPDA performance correctly converges to the CAPA limit, while uncoupled models are shown to violate physics, 2) polarization results in anisotropic array gain behavior, and 3) the coupled beampattern exhibits higher directivity than the uncoupled beampattern."}

This paper proposes successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding for NB-LBCs that are defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^r}, where r is the extension degree. By establishing a one-to-r mapping between the binary composition of each non-binary codeword and r binary polar codewords, SCL decoding of the r polar codes can be performed with a complexity that is sub-quadratic in the codeword length. An r-step decoding path sorting strategy is further proposed to facilitate the decoding. Simulation results on extended Reed-Solomon (eRS) and non-binary extended BCH (NB-eBCH) codes show that SCL decoding can outperform their state-of-the-art soft-decision decoding with fewer finite field arithmetic operations. For length-16 eRS codes, their maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performances can be approached with a moderate list size."}

This paper investigates target detection in a bistatic ISAC system, in which the base station (BS) transmits superimposed ISAC signals comprising both Gaussian information-bearing and deterministic sensing components to simultaneously provide communication and sensing functionalities. First, we develop a Neyman-Pearson (NP)-based detector that effectively utilizes both the deterministic sensing and random communication signals. Closed-form analysis reveals that both signal components contribute to improving the overall detection performance. Subsequently, we optimize the BS transmit beamforming to maximize the detection probability, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for the communication user (CU) and a total transmit power budget at the BS. The resulting non-convex beamforming optimization problem is addressed via semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed NP-based detector, which leverages both types of signals, over benchmark schemes that treat information signals as interference. They also reveal that a higher communication-rate threshold directs more transmit power to Gaussian information-bearing signals, thereby diminishing deterministic-signal power and weakening detection performance."}

The joint optimization of the RIS coefficient vector, power allocation, and receive beamforming in such a system is critical for performance but poses significant challenges due to the non-convex objective, coupled variables, and constant modulus constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel optimization framework. Our approach involves reformulating the sum-rate maximization problem into a tractable equivalent form and developing an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. This algorithm decomposes the problem into subproblems for the RIS coefficients, receive beamformers, and power allocation, each solved using advanced techniques including convex approximation and difference-of-convex programming.

To address these aspects, we first integrate blockage detection into the codebook design process based on the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, significantly reducing inefficiencies due to beam evaluations done in blocked directions.

To address the increased decision complexity resulting from a larger number of constellation points, a dimension reduction (DR) technique is introduced, allowing the derivation of closed-form symbol error probability (SEP) expressions under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions. Theoretical SEPs closely match simulation results, validating the accuracy of the proposed method.

A bi-level optimization problem is formulated to overcome the strong coupling between optimization variables. The upper level jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, PA positions, and feasible interval of power radiation ratios for power conversion efficiency (PCE) maximization under rate requirements, while the lower level refines power radiation ratio for the sum rate maximization. Efficient solutions are developed for both two-user and multi-user scenarios. 1) For the two-user case, where an EHR and an IDR coexist, the alternating optimization (AO)-based and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)-based algorithms are developed to achieve the stationary solutions of transmit beamforming, PA positions, and power radiation ratios. 2) For the multi-user case, a quadratic transform-Lagrangian dual transform (QT-LDT) algorithm is proposed to iteratively update PCE and sum rate by optimizing PA positions and power radiation ratios individually. Closed-form solutions are derived for both maximization problems.
