However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely\non computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental\ninterference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided\nand light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength\nindicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically\ninterpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce\nthe model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to\nenvironmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our\nmodel reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under\nconventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the\nprevious benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance\nis achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a\nMobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions.

For visual content, this paradigm\nshifts from traditional pixel-level transmission toward leveraging the semantic\nstructure of images to communicate visual meaning. Existing approaches\ngenerally follow one of two paths: transmitting only text descriptions, which\noften fail to capture precise spatial layouts and fine-grained appearance\ndetails; or transmitting text alongside dense latent visual features, which\ntends to introduce substantial semantic redundancy. A key challenge, therefore,\nis to reduce semantic redundancy while preserving semantic understanding and\nvisual fidelity, thereby improving overall transmission efficiency. This paper\nintroduces a diffusion-based semantic communication framework with adaptive\nretransmission. The system transmits concise text descriptions together with a\nlimited set of key latent visual features, and employs a diffusion-based\ninpainting model to reconstruct the image. A receiver-side semantic consistency\nmechanism is designed to evaluate the alignment between the reconstructed image\nand the original text description.
