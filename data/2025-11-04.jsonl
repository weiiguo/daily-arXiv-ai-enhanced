However, current marine equipment is deficient in data transmission\nefficiency and semantic comprehension. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a novel End-to-End (E2E) coding scheme, namely the Turbo-based Deep\nSemantic Autoencoder (Turbo-DSA). The Turbo-DSA achieves joint source-channel\ncoding at the semantic level through the E2E design of transmitter and\nreceiver, while learning to adapt to environment changes. The semantic encoder\nand decoder are composed of transformer technology, which efficiently converts\nmessages into semantic vectors. These vectors are dynamically adjusted during\nneural network training according to channel characteristics and background\nknowledge base. The Turbo structure further enhances the semantic vectors.\nSpecifically, the channel encoder utilizes Turbo structure to separate semantic\nvectors, ensuring precise transmission of meaning, while the channel decoder\nemploys Turbo iterative decoding to optimize the representation of semantic\nvectors. This deep integration of the transformer and Turbo structure is\nensured by the design of the objective function, semantic extraction, and the\nentire training process. Compared with traditional Turbo coding techniques, the\nTurbo-DSA shows a faster convergence speed, thanks to its efficient processing\nof semantic vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the Turbo-DSA\nsurpasses existing benchmarks in key performance indicators, such as bilingual\nevaluation understudy scores and sentence similarity. This is particularly\nevident under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, where it shows superior\ntext semantic transmission efficiency and adaptability to variable marine\nchannel environments."}

While the vast majority of research\nconducted from an experimental perspective is progressing rapidly, it demands\nsubstantial computational power, data, and other resources. Therefore, how to\nopen the black-box of LLMs from a theoretical standpoint has become a critical\nchallenge. This paper takes the theory of rate-distortion function, directed\ninformation, and Granger causality as its starting point to investigate the\ninformation-theoretic principles behind LLMs, leading to the development of\nsemantic information theory for LLMs, where the fundamental unit is token,\nrather than bits that lacks any semantic meaning. By defining the probabilistic\nmodel of LLMs, we discuss structure-agnostic information-theoretic measures,\nsuch as the directed rate- distortion function in pre-training, the directed\nrate-reward function in post-training, and the semantic information flow in\ninference phase. This paper also delves deeply into the theory of token-level\nsemantic embedding and the information-theoretically optimal vectorization\nmethod. Thereafter, we propose a general definition of autoregression LLM,\nwhere the Transformer architecture and its performance such as ELBO,\ngeneralization error bound, memory capacity, and semantic information measures\ncan be derived theoretically. Other architectures, such as Mamba/Mamba2 and\nLLaDA, are also discussed in our framework. Consequently, this paper provides a\ntheoretical framework for understanding LLMs from the perspective of semantic\ninformation theory, which also offers the necessary theoretical tools for\nfurther in-depth research."}

Specifically, we prove that there exists a Turing\nmachine which, given a discrete memoryless channel $p_{Y|X}$, a target rate $R$\nless than the channel capacity $C(p_{Y|X})$, and an error tolerance $\\epsilon >\n0$, outputs a block code $\\mathcal{C}$ achieving a rate at least $R$ and a\nmaximum block error probability below $\\epsilon$. The machine operates in the\ngeneral case where all transition probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$ are computable\nreal numbers, and the parameters $R$ and $\\epsilon$ are rational. The proof\nbuilds on Shannon's Channel Coding Theorem and relies on an exhaustive search\napproach that systematically enumerates all codes of increasing block length\nuntil a valid code is found.

The DQN determines the sensing decisions,\nwhile the NN predicts the best beam from the codebook. To capture the effect of\nlimited fresh data during inference, the age of information (AoI) is\nincorporated into the training of both the DQN and the beam predictor. Lyapunov\noptimization is employed to design a reward function that enforces the average\nsensing constraint. Simulation results on a real-world dataset show that\nAoI-aware training improves top-1 and top-3 inference accuracy by 44.16% and\n52.96%, respectively, under a strict sensing constraint. The performance gain,\nhowever, diminishes as the sensing constraint is relaxed."}

We propose a novel signal\nprocessing pipeline that combines radar and inertial measurement unit (IMU)\ndata to achieve accurate and reliable performance in realistic driving\nscenarios. Unlike previous studies, the method employs neural networks to\nprocess sparse and noisy radar measurements, reject detections from moving\nobjects, and estimate radar motion. In addition, a measurement model is\nintroduced to correct IMU bias and scale factor errors. Using vehicle\nkinematics, the radar mounting angle is then computed from the estimated radar\nmotion and the vehicle's yaw rate. To benchmark performance, the proposed\napproach is comprehensively compared with two problem formulations and four\nestimation techniques reported in the literature. Validation is carried out on\nthe challenging RadarScenes dataset, covering over 79 km of real-world driving.\nResults show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and\nrobustness, with reliable estimates obtained within approximately 25 seconds of\ndriving. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate\nthat automotive radar mounting angles can be accurately estimated in complex,\nreal traffic conditions, without requiring controlled environments, dedicated\ntargets, or specially designed driving routes."}

However, existing\nstudies are limited by the scale and diversity of labeled data, constraining\nmodel accuracy, generalizability, and the exploration of broader applications.\nThis study investigates the potential of PPG for holistic health profiling\nthrough the integration of foundation model techniques.\n  Methods: We present AnyPPG, a PPG foundation model pretrained on large-scale,\nmulti-source synchronized PPG-ECG data. By aligning PPG and ECG representations\nwithin a shared space, AnyPPG learns physiologically meaningful features from\nunlabeled signals. Its capability was further evaluated across a diverse set of\ndownstream tasks, encompassing both conventional physiological analysis and\ncomprehensive multi-organ disease diagnosis.\n  Results: Across eleven physiological analysis tasks spanning six independent\ndatasets, AnyPPG achieved state-of-the-art performance, with average\nimprovements of 12.8% in regression and 9.1% in classification tasks over the\nnext-best model. In multi-organ disease diagnosis, AnyPPG demonstrated broad\ncross-system diagnostic potential. Among 1,014 ICD-10 three-digit disease\ncategories, 13 achieved an AUC above 0.8 and 137 exceeded 0.7. Beyond strong\nperformance in cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, valvular\ndisorders, and hypertension, AnyPPG also showed substantial diagnostic value\nfor non-cardiovascular conditions, exemplified by Parkinson's disease (AUC =\n0.78) and chronic kidney disease (AUC = 0.74).\n  Conclusions: AnyPPG demonstrates that a PPG foundation model trained through\nphysiological alignment with ECG can produce accurate and robust signal\nrepresentations.

Three-dimensional (3-D) holographic MIMO offers a pathway to overcome\nthese constraints by exploiting volumetric array configurations that enlarge\nthe effective aperture and unlock additional spatial modes. This work presents\nthe first systematic evaluation that jointly incorporates electromagnetic (EM)\ncharacteristics, such as mutual coupling and radiation efficiency, into the\nanalysis of 3-D arrays under Clarke, Kronecker, and standardized 3rd Generation\nPartnership Project (3GPP) channel models. Analytical derivations and full-wave\nsimulations demonstrate that 3-D architectures achieve higher EDOF, narrower\nbeamwidths, and notable capacity improvements compared with planar baselines.\nIn 3GPP urban macro channels with horizontal element spacing of 0.3 lambda, 3-D\nconfigurations yield approximately 20% capacity improvement over conventional\n2-D arrays, confirming the robustness and scalability of volumetric designs\nunder realistic conditions.

As unit\nintervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of intra-pair skew can\nsignificantly degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. To quantify\nthe impact of intra-pair skew, conventional time-domain methods are often\nunreliable for coupled interconnects due to skew variations across voltage\nlevels, while frequency-domain approaches frequently fail to address\nreciprocity and symmetry issues. This can result in channels that meet skew\nspecifications in one direction but not the other, despite the inherently\nreciprocal nature of skew impact. To address these limitations, we introduce\ntwo new reciprocal parameters for quantifying intra-pair skew effects:\nSkew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and its complementary Figure of\nMerit (FOM SILD). Measurements conducted using 224 Gb/s SerDes IP and a variety\nof channels with different intra-pair skews demonstrate a strong correlation\nbetween FOM SILD and bit error rate (BER). Results show that when FOM SILD is\nbelow 0.2-0.3 dB, BER remains stable, indicating minimal signal integrity\ndegradation; however, BER increases noticeably as FOM SILD exceeds 0.3 dB.\nStatistical analysis across more than 3,000 high-speed twinax cables reveals\nthat the majority exhibit FOM SILD values less than 0.1 dB, underscoring the\npractical relevance of the proposed metrics for high-speed interconnect\nassessment."}
