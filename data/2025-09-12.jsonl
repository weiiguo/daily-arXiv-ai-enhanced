We propose a novel framework where a data center\n(DC) provides energy to pre-configured roadside unit (RSU) pairs during the\ndownlink stage. While in the uplink stage, these RSU pairs utilize a hybrid\nrate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA)\nprotocol to transmit the processed data to the DC, while simultaneously\nperforming local data processing using the harvested energy. Our objective is\nto maximize the minimal processed data volume of the RSU pairs by jointly\noptimizing the RIS downlink and uplink phase shifts, the transmit power of the\nDC and RSUs, the RSU computation resource allocation, and the time slot\nallocation. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we develop an\nefficient iterative algorithm integrating alternating optimization and\nsequential rank-one constraint relaxation methods. Extensive simulations\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline\nschemes under diverse scenarios, validating its effectiveness in enhancing the\ndata processing performance for intelligent transportation applications."}
