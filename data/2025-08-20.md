Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 利用频道知识地图(CKM)提升mmWave系统的物理层安全性，通过多材缆编码和优化资源分配来对投放位置不明的偷听者实现绝对保密速率最大化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统物理层安全方案对偷听者位置和频道状态信息假设的依赖性问题，提供一种不依赖于敌手信息的安全通信方案

Method: 采用高导向性mmWave传输，将保密消息在多个材缆上进行联合编码，利用CKM推导出在最坏情况下优化时间和功率分配的算法

Result: 设计的算法能够在不作任何偷听者位置或CSI假设的情况下，实现绝对保密速率的最大化

Conclusion: CKM作为一种数据驱动工具箱，为mmWave系统提供了一种有效的方法来应对位置不明的偷听者威胁，提升了物理层安全性能力

Abstract: Channel Knowledge Map (CKM) is an emerging data-driven toolbox that captures
our awareness of the wireless channel and enables efficient communication and
resource allocation beyond the state of the art. In this work, we consider CKM
for improving physical-layer security (PLS) in the presence of a passive
eavesdropper (Eve), without making any assumptions about Eve's location or
channel state information (CSI). We employ highly directional mmWave
transmissions, with the confidential message jointly encoded across multiple
beams. By exploiting CKM, we derive an algorithm for time and power allocation
among the beams that maximizes the absolute secrecy rate under the worst-case
scenario for Eve's location.

*Donatella Darsena,Francesco Verde,Marco Di Renzo,Vincenzo Galdi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了近场区域中的Airy光束在下一代无线网络中的应用，对比了它们与高斯光束在非视线传播情况下的性能差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代无线网络中电磁大开口和高频传输扩展了近场区域，这中波前端非平面性为形成和控制放射光束提供了额外自由度

Method: 首先分析连续开口场分布发射的自加速光束原理，然后解决Airy光束生成的挑战（包括有限能量导致的指数衰减和开口截断），并研究其自由空间传播特性

Result: 理论和数值结果显示，在某些非视线通道中，如果Airy光束的关键特性（沿抛物线轨迹自加速和无衍射传播）大体保持，它们可能比高斯光束有更好的性能优势

Conclusion: 在存在障碍物的情况下，要使Airy光束保持其优势，需要发射开口中有充分大的部分保持与接收器的视线通道

Abstract: In next-generation wireless networks, the combination of electrically large
radiating apertures and high-frequency transmission extends the radiating
near-field region around the transmitter. In this region, unlike in the far
field, the wavefront is nonplanar, which provides additional degrees of freedom
to shape and steer the transmitted beam in a desired manner. In this paper, we
focus on Airy beams, which may exhibit several highly desirable properties in
the near-field region. Ideally, these beams follow self-accelerating (curved)
trajectories, demonstrate resilience to perturbations through self-healing, and
maintain a consistent intensity profile across all planes perpendicular to the
propagation direction, making them effectively diffraction-free. Specifically,
we first present the underlying principles of self-accelerating beams radiated
by continuous aperture field distributions. We then address several challenges
regarding the generation of Airy beams, including their exponential decay due
to finite energy constraints and spatial truncation of the aperture. Moreover,
we examine their free-space propagation characteristics. The second part of the
paper focuses on the propagation behavior of Airy beams in non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) scenarios. A comparison is also presented between Airy beams and
Gaussian beams. Our theoretical and numerical results show that Airy beams may
offer a performance advantage over Gaussian beams in certain NLoS channels,
provided that their key properties are largely preserved, specifically,
self-acceleration along a parabolic trajectory and diffraction-free
propagation. In the presence of an obstacle, this requires that the portion of
the transmit aperture with a clear line-of-sight to the receiver is
sufficiently large.

### [3] [Joint AP Selection and Power Allocation for Unicast-Multicast Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13771)
*Mustafa S. Abbas,Zahra Mobini,Hien Quoc Ngo,Hyundong Shin,Michail Matthaiou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了支持单播和多播传输的无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统，推导了频谱效率的闭式表达式，提出了基于APG的联合AP选择和功率分配优化算法，显著提升了加权和频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网等无线系统的发展，联合单播和多播传输变得越来越重要。现有系统需要同时支持这两种传输类型，特别是多播需要服务多个用户组，这带来了新的技术挑战。

Method: 推导了零迫近和最大比预编码下频谱效率的精确闭式表达式，构建了加权和频谱效率最大化问题，考虑了AP最大发射功率、前传容量限制和服务质量约束，提出了基于加速投影梯度(APG)的算法和基于逐次凸近似(SCA)的基准算法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的联合优化方法在各种系统设置和预编码策略下显著提升了加权和频谱效率。APG算法在保持竞争性能的同时实现了显著的复杂度降低。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模实际部署提供了高效的解决方案，APG算法特别适合大规模系统，在性能和复杂度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Joint unicast and multicast transmissions are becoming increasingly important
in practical wireless systems, such as Internet of Things networks. This paper
investigates a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output system that
simultaneously supports both transmission types, with multicast serving
multiple groups. Exact closed-form expressions for the achievable downlink
spectral efficiency (SE) of both unicast and multicast users are derived for
zero-forcing and maximum ratio precoding designs. Accordingly, a weighted sum
SE (SSE) maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the access
point (AP) selection and power allocation. The optimization framework accounts
for practical constraints, including the maximum transmit power per AP,
fronthaul capacity limitations between APs and the central processing unit, and
quality-of-service requirements for all users. The resulting non-convex
optimization problem is reformulated into a tractable structure, and an
accelerated projected gradient (APG)-based algorithm is developed to
efficiently obtain near-optimal solutions. As a performance benchmark, a
successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is also implemented.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach
significantly enhances the SSE across various system setups and precoding
strategies. In particular, the APG-based algorithm achieves substantial
complexity reduction while maintaining competitive performance, making it
well-suited for large-scale practical deployments.

TL;DR: 基于可移动天线(MA)的新型无细胞感通一体化系统架构，通过空间分集提升通信速率和感知精度，减少时间同步错误的影响

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无细胞感通一体化系统在6G网络中具有广阔前景，但时间同步错误成为关键挑战，需要新方案来减少其影响

Method: 提出基于MA的CF-ISAC架构，形成最坏情况感知优化问题，求解最坏情况CRLB，并使用流形优化(MO)和元强化学习(MA-MetaRL)等方法进行关联优化

Result: 模拟结果显示该算法显著提高了检测精度，对时间同步错误具有强镇定性，且比传统固定天线技术获得更高系统容量

Conclusion: 该研究提出的MA辅助CF-ISAC架构有效解决了时间同步错误挑战，在保持感知精度的同时提升了通信性能，为6G网络发展提供了有效觤决方案

Abstract: The cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) system, which
effectively mitigates intra-cell interference and provides precise sensing
accuracy, is a promising technology for future 6G networks. However, to fully
capitalize on the potential of CF-ISAC, accurate time synchronization (TS)
between access points (APs) is critical. Due to the limitations of current
synchronization technologies, TS errors have become a significant challenge in
the development of the CF-ISAC system. In this paper, we propose a novel
CF-ISAC architecture based on movable antennas (MAs), which exploits spatial
diversity to enhance communication rates, maintain sensing accuracy, and reduce
the impact of TS errors. We formulate a worst-case sensing accuracy
optimization problem for TS errors to address this challenge, deriving the
worst-case Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Subsequently, we develop a joint
optimization framework for AP beamforming and MA positions to satisfy
communication rate constraints while improving sensing accuracy. A robust
optimization framework is designed for the highly complex and non-convex
problem. Specifically, we employ manifold optimization (MO) to solve the
worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem. Then, we propose an
MA-enabled meta-reinforcement learning (MA-MetaRL) to design optimization
variables while satisfying constraints on MA positions, communication rate, and
transmit power, thereby improving sensing accuracy. The simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed robust optimization algorithm significantly
improves the accuracy of the detection and is strong against TS errors.
Moreover, compared to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) technologies,
the proposed MA-aided CF-ISAC architecture achieves higher system capacity,
thus validating its effectiveness.

### [5] [Distributed Distortion-Aware Robust Optimization for Movable Antenna-aided Cell-Free ISAC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13839)

Conclusion: 可移动天线辅助的无细胞集成感知通信系统在减少硬件扩展影响方面具有显著优势，为6G网络提供了更高的稳健性和性能

Abstract: The cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) architecture is
a promising enabler for 6G, offering spectrum efficiency and ubiquitous
coverage. However, real deployments suffer from hardware impairments,
especially nonlinear distortion from power amplifiers (PAs), which degrades
both communication and sensing. To address this, we propose a movable antenna
(MA)-aided CF-ISAC system that mitigates distortion and enhances robustness.
The PAs nonlinearities are modeled by a third-order memoryless polynomial,
where the third-order distortion coefficients (3RDCs) vary across access points
(APs) due to hardware differences, aging, and environmental conditions. We
design a distributed distortion-aware worst-case robust optimization framework
that explicitly incorporates uncertainty in 3RDCs. First, we analyze the
worst-case impact of PA distortion on both the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)
and communication rate. Then, to address the resulting non-convexity, we apply
successive convex approximation (SCA) for estimating the 3RDCs. With these, we
jointly optimize beamforming and MA positions under transmit power and sensing
constraints. To efficiently solve this highly non-convex problem, we develop an
MA-enabled self-attention convolutional graph neural network (SACGNN)
algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the
communication-sensing trade-off under distortion and outperforms fixed-position
antenna baselines in terms of robustness and capacity, thereby highlighting the
advantages of MA-aided CF-ISAC systems.

### [6] [Evaluating Particle Filtering for RSS-Based Target Localization under Varying Noise Levels and Sensor Geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13937)
*Halim Lee,Jongmin Park,Kwansik Park*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了基于粒子筛波的RSS目标定位算法，通过模拟对比证明其在不利传感器布局和高噪声情况下比传统三边测量方法更准确


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然粒子筛波已用于RSS目标定位，但缺少对不同传感器布局和噪声水平下性能的系统分析，需要填补这一研空白

Method: 设计和评估了一种用于静止目标定位的粒子筛波算法，并与传统的RSS三边测量方法在不同传感器配置和噪声条件下进行对比

Result: 模拟结果显示，粒子筛波法比三边测量方法提供更准确的目标定位，尤其在传感器布局不利和RSS噪声高的场景下

Conclusion: 粒子筛波算法在RSS目标定位中表现优异，特别适用于具有挑战性的环境条件

Abstract: Target localization is a critical task in various applications, such as
search and rescue, surveillance, and wireless sensor networks. When a target
emits a radio frequency (RF) signal, spatially distributed sensors can collect
signal measurements to estimate the target's location. Among various
measurement modalities, received signal strength (RSS) is particularly
attractive due to its low cost, low power consumption, and ease of deployment.
While particle filtering has previously been applied to RSS-based target
localization, few studies have systematically analyzed its performance under
varying sensor geometries and RSS noise levels. This paper addresses this gap
by designing and evaluating a particle filtering algorithm for localizing a
stationary target. The proposed method is compared with a conventional
RSS-based trilateration approach across different sensor configurations and
noise conditions. Simulation results indicate that particle filtering provides
more accurate target localization than trilateration, particularly in scenarios
with unfavorable sensor geometries and high RSS noise.

### [7] [A Convergent Primal-Dual Algorithm for Computing Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13486)
*Chunhui Chen,Linyi Chen,Xueyan Niu,Hao Wu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的理论框架咇算法，用于计算率盈-夺真-感知（RDP）函数，解决了现有方法缺乏理论保证的问题，并首次证明了O(1/n)的严格收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RDP函数计算方法缺乏理论保证，特别是在复杂的感知约束引入非凸性咇计算不可行性时。需要一种具有严格收敛性证明的算法来充实理论基础。

Method: 通过松弛重建分布的约束，将其替换为对重建分布本身的替代优化方法。基于这种重新形式化，发展了一种新的原始对偶算法，并证明了其收敛性。

Result: 首次证明了RDP函数计算的O(1/n)收敛速率，填补了现有文献中的理论空白。实验结果显示该算法在代表性场景中具有竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了RDP理论中的关键问题，为RDP约束压缩系统提供了更可靠咇可解释的优化方法，为进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in Rate-Distortion-Perception (RDP) theory highlight the
importance of balancing compression level, reconstruction quality, and
perceptual fidelity. While previous work has explored numerical approaches to
approximate the information RDP function, the lack of theoretical guarantees
remains a major limitation, especially in the presence of complex perceptual
constraints that introduce non-convexity and computational intractability.
Inspired by our previous constrained Blahut-Arimoto algorithm for solving the
rate-distortion function, in this paper, we present a new theoretical framework
for computing the information RDP function by relaxing the constraint on the
reconstruction distribution and replacing it with an alternative optimization
approach over the reconstruction distribution itself. This reformulation
significantly simplifies the optimization and enables a rigorous proof of
convergence. Based on this formulation, we develop a novel primal-dual
algorithm with provable convergence guarantees. Our analysis establishes, for
the first time, a rigorous convergence rate of $O(1/n)$ for the computation of
RDP functions. The proposed method not only bridges a key theoretical gap in
the existing literature but also achieves competitive empirical performance in
representative settings. These results lay the groundwork for more reliable and
interpretable optimization in RDP-constrained compression systems. Experimental
results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

### [8] [On optimal quantum LRCs from the Hermitian construction and $t$-designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13553)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文通过Hermitian构造方法研究了量子本地可恢复码(qLRCs)的界限和构造，解决了Luo等人提出的开放问题，得到了三个明确的最优qLRCs家族。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子本地可恢复码在大规模量子数据存储中具有重要应用潜力，并且对量子LDPC码有重要意义。本文动机是通过Hermitian构造方法来研究qLRCs的理论界限和实际构造。

Method: 使用Hermitian构造斶方法，首先构造了几个具有普遍灵活维数的新的NMDS码无限家族，这些码支持2和3设计，然后将其应用于获得Hermitian对偶包含的经典LRCs，最终得到量子LRCs。

Result: 提出了qLRCs的四个界限，并进行了流行公式比较。构造了三个明确的最优qLRCs家族，这些码的参数比通过CSS构造获得的已知qLRCs更新、更灵活。同时，构造的经典LRCs本身也在四个不同界限下达到最优。

Conclusion: 本文通过Hermitian构造方法成功地构造了参数灵活的最优量子本地可恢复码，为大规模量子数据存储提供了新的解决方案，并且所构造的经典LRCs也具有独立的理论价值。

Abstract: In a recent work, quantum locally recoverable codes (qLRCs) have been
introduced for their potential application in large-scale quantum data storage
and implication for quantum LDPC codes. This work focuses on the bounds and
constructions of qLRCs derived from the Hermitian construction, which solves an
open problem proposed by Luo $et~al.$ (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 71 (3):
1794-1802, 2025). We present four bounds for qLRCs and give comparisons in
terms of their asymptotic formulas. We construct several new infinite families
of NMDS codes, with general and flexible dimensions, that support t-designs for
$t\in \{2,3\}$, and apply them to obtain Hermitian dual-containing classical
LRCs (cLRCs). As a result, we derive three explicit families of optimal qLRCs.
Compared to the known qLRCs obtained by the CSS construction, our optimal qLRCs
offer new and more flexible parameters. It is also worth noting that the
constructed cLRCs themselves are interesting as they are optimal with respect
to four distinct bounds for cLRCs.

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了瑞利衰落信道中的隐蔽通信优化问题，为非因果和因果CSI情况分别提供了有效的解决方案，实现了正速率的隐蔽通信。

Abstract: We aim to achieve keyless covert communication with a positive-rate in
Rayleigh block-fading channels. Specifically, the transmitter and the
legitimate receiver are assumed to have either causal or non-causal knowledge
of the \ac{CSI} for both the legitimate and the warden channels, while the
warden only knows the statistical distribution of the \ac{CSI}. Two problem
formulations are considered in this work: (a) Power allocation: maximizing the
sum covert rate subject to a maximum power constraint, and (b) Rate allocation:
minimizing the power consumption subject to a minimum covert rate constraint.
Both problems are formulated based on recent information theoretical results on
covert communication over state-dependent channels. When the \ac{CSI} of each
fading block is known non-causally, we propose a novel three-step method to
solve both the power and rate allocation problems. In the case where the
\ac{CSI} is known causally, the power allocation problem can be formulated as
\ac{MDP} and be solved using a \ac{DDQN} approach. Although the rate allocation
problem under causal \ac{CSI} does not directly conform to an \ac{MDP}
structure, it can be approximately solved using the \ac{DDQN} trained for power
allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
power and rate allocation methods and provide comprehensive performance
comparisons across different allocation schemes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模MIMO系统中使用无线中继器群时遇到的两个核心问题：如何避免中继器之间互相作用导致的正反馈破坏效果，以及在中继器注入噪声和干扰的情况下能够获得多大的性能改善。

Conclusion: 无线中继器群可以在大规模MIMO系统中带来显著的性能改善，但需要通过理论分析确保系统稳定性，并采用合理的部署策略来充分发挥其优势。

Abstract: We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters
are deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with
small form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They
can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent
to the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with
amplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in
repeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive
feedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and
amplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be
achieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more
interference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist
stability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check
stability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an
efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user
transmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum
rate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our
theoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the
system performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results
also warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for
example, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between
repeaters and the base station.

Abstract: This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system and proposes a joint
communication and sensing beamforming design based on non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) technology. The system employs a dual-functional base station
(DFBS) to simultaneously serve multiple users and sense multiple targets with
the aid of RIS. To maximize the sum-rate of users, we jointly optimize the
DFBS's active beamforming, the RIS's reflection coefficients, and the radar
receive filters. The optimization is performed under constraints including the
radar signal-to-noise ratio thresholds, the user
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirements, the phase shifts of the
RIS, the total transmit power, the receive filters, and the successive
interference cancellation decoding order. To tackle the complex
interdependencies and non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we
introduce an effective iterative algorithm based on the alternating
optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms, highlighting its distinct advantages
in the considered RIS-empowered NOMA-ISAC systems.
