To achieve confidentiality, the proposed system opportunistically exploits intrinsic features of feedback-aided URA without adding any overhead or altering its original structure or operational characteristics. As a result, the proposed system preserves the low-cost advantages of URA, including low delay and minimal signaling overhead, while providing secure communication. To secure transmission, each user generates a secret key and an artificial noise sequence from the feedback signal that the BS broadcasts in previous transmission rounds. This feedback depends on the BS-user channel, making it a private signal for each user. The secure transmission is performed by three actions: encrypting the data using the secret key, sending only the parity bits of the LDPC encoded secret key to allow the legitimate receiver to recover it, and masking these parity bits with the artificial noise. For reception, a receiver algorithm is designed for the legitimate user, and a leakage analysis is provided to quantify the information available to the eavesdropper. The simulation results show that meaningful secrecy is achieved in URA without modifying its structure and with negligible impact on standard performance."}

High-accuracy distributed coordination of microwave wireless systems supports the ability to transmit different parts of a signal from separate transmitters such that they combine coherently at a designated destination. In this paper we explore this concept using a two-element coherent distributed phased array where each of the two transmitters sends a separate component of a communication signal where each symbol is decomposed into a sum of two pseudo-random signal vectors, the coherent summation of which yields the intended symbol. By directing the transmission to an intended receiver using distributed beamforming, the summation of the two vector components is largely confined to a spatial region at the destination receiver. We implement the technique in a 50 wavelength array operating at 3 GHz. We evaluate the symbol error ratio. (SER) in two-dimensional space through simulation and measurement, showing the approach yields a spatially confined secure region where the information is recoverable(i.e., the received signal has low SER), and outside of which the information is unrecoverable (high SER). The proposed system is also compared against a traditional beamforming system where each node sends the same data. We validate experimentally that our approach achieves a low SER of 0.0082 at broadside and a SER above 0.25 at all other locations compared to a traditional beamforming approach that achieves a SER of 0 at all locations measured."}

Motivated by this potential, we investigate the issue of joint localization and channel estimation for the uplink PASS in the presence of multipath dispersion. To this end, a comprehensive multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink PASS model is first established, where the use of a cyclic prefix (CP) enables the multipath-induced time-domain dispersion to be transformed into a set of superimposed sinusoids in the frequency domain. Building upon this model, we propose a hybrid inference framework capable of accurately estimating both channel parameters and user locations. Specifically, expectation propagation is first employed to mitigate multi-user interference, while the path delays are then extracted from noisy channel state information using an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based approach, or a hybrid belief propagation-variational inference (BP-VI) algorithm. Then the estimated delays are subsequently refined through the embedded geometric information via an iterative localization procedure, wherein the estimated channel matrices are recursively fed back to EP. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to characterize the fundamental estimation limits. Finally, simulation results validate that our proposed framework closely approaches the CRLB, with performance comparable to cooperative multi-base station localization, with significantly fewer RF chains and reduced hardware complexity."}

The source-IRS and IRS-destination links are subject to various challenges, including atmospheric attenuation, asymmetric $α$-$μ$ distributed small-scale fading, and beam misalignment-induced pointing errors. The IRS link is characterized using the Laguerre series expansion (LSE) approximation, while both the source-IRS and IRS-destination channels are modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) $α$-$μ$ fading channels.

However, the complex and dynamic low-altitude environment, like the urban and mountainous areas, makes clutter a significant factor affecting the sensing performance. Traditional clutter suppression methods based on Doppler difference or signal strength are inadequate for scenarios with dynamic clutter and slow-moving targets like low-altitude UAVs. In this paper, motivated by the concept of channel knowledge map (CKM), we propose a novel clutter suppression technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, by leveraging a new type of CKM named clutter angle map (CLAM). CLAM is a site-specific database, containing location-specific primary clutter angles for the coverage area of the ISAC base station (BS). With CLAM, the sensing signal components corresponding to the clutter environment can be effectively removed before target detection and parameter estimation, which greatly enhances the sensing performance. Besides, to take into account the scenarios when the targets and clutters are in close directions so that pure CLAM-based spatial domain clutter suppression is no longer effective, we further propose a two-step CLAM-enabled joint spatial-Doppler domain clutter suppression algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique effectively suppresses clutter and enhances target sensing performance, achieving accurate parameter estimation for sensing slow-moving low-altitude UAV targets."}

Similar to multisensory perception, Physical AI makes decisions based on multimodal updates from sensors and devices. Physical AI thus operates with a finite spatial footprint of its sensory tributaries. The multimodal updates traverse heterogeneous and unreliable paths, involving wireless links. Throughput or latency guarantees do not ensure correct decision-making, as misaligned, misordered, or stale inputs still yield wrong inferences. Preserving decision-time coherence hinges on three timing primitives at the network-application interface: (i) simultaneity, a short coincidence window that groups measurements as co-temporal, (ii) causality, path-wise delivery that never lets a consequence precede its precursor, and (iii) usefulness, a validity horizon that drops information too stale to influence the current action. In this work, we focus on usefulness and adopt temporal window of integration (TWI)-Causality: the TWI enforces decision-time usefulness by assuming path-wise causal consistency and cross-path simultaneity are handled upstream. We model end-to-end path delay as the sum of sensing/propagation, computation, and access/transmission latencies, and formulate network design as minimizing the validity horizon under a delivery reliability constraint. In effect, this calibrates delay-reliability budgets for a timing-aware system operating over sensors within a finite spatial footprint. The joint choice of horizon and per-path reliability is cast as a convex optimization problem, solved to global optimality to obtain the minimal horizon and per-path allocation of reliability. This is compared favourably to a benchmark based on uniform-after-threshold allocation. Overall, this study contributes to timing-aware Physical AI in next-generation networks."}

Among candidate waveforms, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been extensively investigated over the past decade for its robustness against frequency-selective fading and its favorable ranging performance. However, the waveform's sensing and communication (S&C) performance depends strongly on the modulation scheme; while variable-amplitude constellations such as quadrature amplitude (QAM) are more efficient for communication, constant-modulus modulations such as phase shift keying (PSK) are more suitable for sensing. Yet, it remains unclear whether these findings persist under power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity. Because OFDM signals exhibit a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), they require highly linear PAs to avoid distortion, which conflicts with radar requirements, where high transmit power is always beneficial for sensing. In this work, we analyze the effect of PA-induced distortions on the sensing task for PSK and QAM constellations. By introducing the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), we examine the extent of the distortion limitation on the ranging task. We complement simulation results with a theoretical characterization of the ambiguity function (AF), thereby explicitly demonstrating how distortion artifacts manifest in the zero-Doppler sidelobes (i.e, ranging sidelobes) and the zero-delay sidelobes. Simulations show that PA distortions impose a palpable performance ceiling for both constellations, reshape the AF, and reduce detection probability, diminishing the theoretical advantage of unimodular signaling and further compromising the OFDM sensing performance with non-uniform envelope signals."}

Machinery subnetworks (SNs) collaboratively train a global model by uploading local updates to an edge server (ES), either directly or via neighboring SNs acting as decode-and-forward relays. To enhance communication efficiency, relays perform partial aggregation before forwarding the models to the ES, significantly reducing overhead and training latency. We analyze the convergence behavior of this relay-assisted FL scheme. To address the inherent energy efficiency (EE) challenges, we decompose the original non-convex optimization problem into sub-problems addressing computation and communication energy separately. An SN grouping algorithm categorizes devices into single-hop and two-hop transmitters based on latency minimization, followed by a relay selection mechanism. To improve FL reliability, we further maximize the number of SNs that meet the roundwise delay constraint, promoting broader participation and improved convergence stability under practical IIoT data distributions. Transmit power levels are then optimized to maximize EE, and a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method is proposed for joint configuration of system parameters. We further extend the EE formulation to the imperfect channel state information (ICSI). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances convergence speed, reduces outage probability from 10-2 in single-hop to 10-6 and achieves substantial energy savings, with the SPCA approach reducing energy consumption by at least 2x compared to unaggregated cooperation and up to 6x over single-hop transmission."}

However, DL models lack statistical guarantees and, moreover, are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, raising fundamental concerns about their reliability in adversarial wireless environments. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarially resilient speculative array processing framework that consists of a low-latency DL classifier backed by a theoretically-grounded GLRT validator, where DL is used for fast speculative inference and later confirmed with the GLRT. We show that second order statistics of the received array, which the GLRT operates on, are spatially invariant to L-p bounded adversarial perturbations, providing adversarial robustness and theoretically-grounded validation of DL predictions. Empirical evaluations under multiple L-p bounds, perturbation designs, and perturbation magnitudes corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed framework in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art baselines."}
