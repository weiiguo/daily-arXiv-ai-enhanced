The network is characterized by a row-stochastic\nadjacency matrix, which reflects different channel gains between the clients.\nIn our privacy-preserving approach, both the transmit power for model updates\nand the level of injected Gaussian noise are jointly controlled to satisfy a\ngiven privacy and energy budget. We show that our proposed algorithm achieves a\nconvergence rate of O(log T), where T is the horizon bound in the regret\nfunction.

In this paper, we investigate extended AG\ncodes and Roth-Lempel type AG codes, including their dual codes and minimum\ndistances. Moreover, we show that for certain $g$, the length of a $g$-MDS code\nover a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ can attain $q+1+2g\\sqrt{q}$, which is\nachieved by an extended AG code from the maximal curves of genus $g$. Notably,\nfor some small finite fields, this length $q+1+2g\\sqrt{q}$ is the largest among\nall known $g$-MDS codes. Subsequently, we establish that the covering radius of\nan $[n,k]$ extended AG code has $g+2$ possible values. For the case of $g=1$,\nwe prove that this range reduces to two possible values when the length $n$ is\nsufficiently large, or when there exists an $[n,k+1]$ MDS elliptic code."}

It is demonstrated that a first-order HMM\nprovides a natural framework for the decoder.

Each hidden state contains a pair of two encoded bits, and parity\nchecks are naturally incorporated into the observation model. The paper shows\nthat by implementing a forward-backward smoothing estimator for the hidden\nstates, decoding is efficient and requires only a small number of iterations in\nmost cases.

To address both challenges, we develop a\nSIM-enhanced wideband multiuser transceiver built on orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM). The sparse\nactivation of OFDM-IM confines high-fidelity equalization to the active tones,\neffectively widening the usable bandwidth. To make the design\nreliability-aware, we directly target the worst-link bit-error rate (BER) and\nadopt a max-min per-tone signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a\nprincipled surrogate, turning the reliability optimization tractable. For\nframe-rate inference and interpretability, we propose an unfolded\nprojected-gradient-descent network (UPGD-Net) that double-unrolls across the\nSIM's layers and algorithmic iterations: each cell computes the analytic\ngradient from the cascaded precoder with a learnable per-iteration step size.\nSimulations on wideband multiuser downlinks show fast, monotone convergence, an\nevident layer-depth sweet spot, and consistent gains in worst-link BER and sum\nrate. By combining structural sparsity with a BER-driven, deep-unfolded\noptimization backbone, the proposed framework directly addresses the key\nwideband deficiencies of SIM."}
