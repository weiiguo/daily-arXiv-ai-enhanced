Our results include: i) uniquely decodable code constructions for a constant number of errors of any type with redundancy twice the Gilbert-Varshamov bound; ii) list-decodable codes via a proposed extension of graph coloring, namely, hypergraph labeling; iii) an incremental synchronization scheme with reduced average-case communication when the edit distance is not precisely known; and iv) the first asymptotically optimal codes (up to a factor of 8) for correcting bursts of unbounded-length edits. Compared to syndrome compression, our approach is more flexible and generalizable, does not rely on a good base code, and achieves improved redundancy across a range of parameters."}

We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility."}

This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks. The proposed spatial array is evaluated against specialized cores for each kernel using High-Level Synthesis (HLS).

While advanced modulation schemes have been proposed to mitigate interference, determining the channel impulse response (CIR) under arbitrary flow directions remains a challenge; existing exact solutions are restricted to either 1-D/no-drift scenarios or planar receiver geometries. Addressing this gap, we derive the first exact analytical CIR for a spherical receiver in a 3-D molecular communication system with uniform drift in an arbitrary direction. Unlike prior approximations that ignore the angle between the drift and the transmission axis, our approach utilizes the Girsanov theorem to analytically transform the hitting-time distribution from a stationary medium to a drifted one. The proposed closed-form expression not only eliminates modeling errors inherent in previous approximations for off-axis receivers but also enables efficient parameter-space exploration of critical system metrics (e.g., peak time and amplitude), a task that would be computationally costly with pure simulation-based approaches."}

By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task."}

Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Information-Guided Masking strategy that dynamically allocates attention to time-frequency regions with high information density to improve learning efficiency, and incorporate a Barlow Twins regularizer to align cross-modal representations without negative samples. Experiments on three public datasets show that CIG-MAE consistently outperforms SOTA SSL methods and even surpasses a fully supervised baseline, demonstrating superior data efficiency, robustness, and representation generalization."}

However, its known analytical intractability presents persistent channel characterization and performance analysis challenges. This paper introduces two effective and mathematically tractable surrogate models for the Lognormal distribution, constructed from the product of Nakagami-$m$ and Inverse Nakagami-$m$ (I-Nakagami-$m$) variates. These models yield asymptotically exact closed-form expressions for key performance metrics -- including the characteristic function, bit error rate, and Shannon's capacity -- and enable analytically tractable expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the composite $α$-$μ$-Lognormal fading model. To facilitate implementation, a moment-matching framework is developed to map the Lognormal parameters to the surrogate model parameters. In addition, a random mixture approach is proposed to enhance convergence by exploiting the complementary approximation properties of the Nakagami-$m$ and I-Nakagami-$m$ distributions. The methodology is further extended to heterogeneous cascaded fading channels comprising arbitrary combinations of $α$-$μ$, $κ$-$μ$, and $η$-$μ$ variates, for which moment-based mappings to the equivalent Lognormal distributions are derived. Numerical results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach, positioning it as a practical and reliable alternative to exact Lognormal statistics."}

This optimization typically assumes prior knowledge of the target direction, which is unavailable before the target is detected. To enhance direction estimation, it is critical to develop array pattern synthesis techniques that yield a wider beam by maximizing the received power over the entire target area. Although this challenge has been addressed with active antennas, RIS systems pose a unique challenge due to their inherent phase constraints, which can be continuous or discrete.\n  This work addresses this challenge through a novel array pattern synthesis method tailored for discrete phase constraints in RIS. We introduce a penalty method that pushes these constraints to the boundary of the convex hull. Then, the Minorization-Maximization (MM) method is utilized to reformulate the problem into a convex one. Our numerical results show that our algorithm can generate a wide beam pattern comparable to that achievable with per-power constraints, with both the amplitudes and phases being adjustable. We compare our method with a traditional beam sweeping technique, showing a) several orders of magnitude reduction of the MSE of Angle of Arrival (AOA) at low to medium Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)s; and b) $8$~dB SNR reduction to achieve a high probability of detection."}

The confounding effects of multi-antenna channels can interfere with the statistical properties of MIMO signals, making identification particularly challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Channel-Aware Multi-Domain feature extraction (CAMD) framework for AMR in MIMO systems. Our CAMD framework reconstructs the transmitted signal through an efficient channel compensation module and achieves a more robust representation capability against channel interference by extracting and integrating multi-domain features, including intra-antenna temporal correlations and inter-antenna channel correlations. We have verified our method on the widely-used dataset, MIMOSig-Ref, with complex mobile channel environments. Extensive experiments confirm the performance advantages of CAMD over previous state-of-the-art methods."}

In the supervised setting, the accuracy of detecting turns with smartphones was compared against turns detected with a motion capture system (mocap) using F1 scores.

In the unsupervised setting, test-retest reliability was assessed by ICC(2,1), and correlations with clinical and patient-reported measures by Spearman rank correlation. Ninety-six PwMS were included. In the supervised setting, turns were detected with high accuracy (F1 scores >95% across smartphone wear locations). Smartphone-derived turn speed was comparable across the supervised (1.44 rad/s) and unsupervised settings (1.47 rad/s), and with mocap-derived turn speed (1.47 rad/s). ICC(3,1) revealed high agreement between smartphone- and mocap-derived turn speed (ICC[3,1]: 0.87-0.92 across smartphone wear locations). Bias was minimal (-0.04 to 0.11 rad/s).

Extending a well-known distributed optimization strategy called diffusion adaptation to Riemannian manifolds, we show that the resulting algorithm, the Riemannian diffusion adaptation, provably exhibits several desirable behaviors when minimizing a sum of geodesically smooth non-convex functions over manifolds of bounded curvature. More specifically, we establish that the algorithm can approximately achieve network agreement in the sense that Fréchet variance of the iterates among the agents is small. Moreover, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a first-order stationary point for general geodesically non-convex cost functions. When the global cost function additionally satisfies the Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition, we also show that it converges linearly under a constant step size up to a steady-state error. Finally, we apply this algorithm to a decentralized robust principal component analysis (PCA) problem formulated on the Grassmann manifold and illustrate its convergence and performance through numerical simulations."}

Our key contribution is a Markov-renewal process (MRP) formulation that, for the first time, analytically predicts the mean and variance of registered photon counts under dead time. To make this MRP model computationally tractable, we introduce a spectral truncation rule that efficiently computes the complex covariance statistics. By proving the shift-invariance of the process, we extend this per-pixel model to full histogram cube generation via a precomputed lookup table. Our method generates 3D cubes indistinguishable from the sequential gold-standard, yet is orders of magnitude faster.

At the center-stage, while waveguide based pinching antennas have been shown to beneficially ameliorate wireless propagation environments, their applications have remained confined to high-frequency scenarios. As a remedy, we propose a downlink generalized pinching-antenna system that adapts this compelling concept to low-frequency operation through a leaky-coaxial-cable (LCX) implementation. By endowing LCX structures with controllable radiation slots, the system inherits the key capabilities of waveguide based pinching antennas. Explicitly, these include reconfigurable line-of-sight (LoS) links, reduced path loss, and flexible deployment, while supporting a practical implementation of the pinching-antenna concept at low frequencies. A twin-stage propagation model is developed for characterizing both the guided transmission and wireless radiation encountered over LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths. Analytical results reveal strong local gain, complemented by rapid distance-dependent decay. Hence, we conceive a matching joint optimization framework, which maximizes throughput by harnessing game-theoretic association and convex power allocation.

This was then utilized to design efficient \\textit{sensing subspace codes} that estimate the DoA with good resolution. Specifically, the Bose-Chowla sensing subspace code provides near optimal code design for unique DoA estimation with tight theoretical upper bound on the error performance. However, the currently known decoder for these codes, to estimate the DoA, is a traditional \\textit{Maximum-a-Posterior (MAP) decoder} with complexity that is cubic with the number of antennas. In this work, we propose novel efficient decoding algorithms for sensing subspace codes, that reduce the complexity down to quadratic while providing new knobs to tune in order to tradeoff complexity with error performance. The decoders are further evaluated for their performance via Monte Carlo simulations for a range of SNRs demonstrating promising performance that smoothly approaches the MAP performance as the complexity grows from quadratic to cubic in the number of antennas."}

We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility."}

While advanced modulation schemes have been proposed to mitigate interference, determining the channel impulse response (CIR) under arbitrary flow directions remains a challenge; existing exact solutions are restricted to either 1-D/no-drift scenarios or planar receiver geometries. Addressing this gap, we derive the first exact analytical CIR for a spherical receiver in a 3-D molecular communication system with uniform drift in an arbitrary direction. Unlike prior approximations that ignore the angle between the drift and the transmission axis, our approach utilizes the Girsanov theorem to analytically transform the hitting-time distribution from a stationary medium to a drifted one. The proposed closed-form expression not only eliminates modeling errors inherent in previous approximations for off-axis receivers but also enables efficient parameter-space exploration of critical system metrics (e.g., peak time and amplitude), a task that would be computationally costly with pure simulation-based approaches."}

In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task."}
