Although active RIS architectures mitigate this issue, they require high power consumption and introduce practical challenges due to the need for integrated amplifiers. Recently, reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surfaces (RDARS) have been proposed to alleviate multiplicative fading through connected modes. In this work, we compare RIS, active RIS, and RDARS in terms of coverage and energy efficiency (EE) in both sub-6GHz and mmWave bands, and we investigate the impact of placement and the number of elements of reconfigurable surface (RS) on EE and coverage. The simulation results show that RDARS offers a highly energy-efficient alternative of enhancing coverage in sub-6GHz systems, while active RIS is significantly more energy-efficient in mmWave systems. Additionally, for a lower number of RS elements and for near UEs, RIS remains considerably more energy-efficient than both active RIS and RDARS."}

Moreover, the introduction of recently developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the performance gains of ISAC systems. Although the gains of MA-enabled ISAC systems are relatively well studied in the far field, they remain almost unexplored in near-field scenarios. Motivated by this, in this paper we maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining a minimum sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms that optimize the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer, the sensing receive combiner, the positions of the users' MAs and the positions of the base station (BS) transmit MAs in an alternating manner for the considered ISAC system, for the cases where linear procoding and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding are employed at the BS. Simulation results show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial performance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems equipped with fixed antennas only. We show that the scheme with linear precoding achieves larger WSR for unequal users' weight rates, while the scheme with ZF precoding maintains an approximately constant WSR for all users' weight rates. Additionally, we demonstrate that the WSRs of the proposed schemes are highly dependent on the inter-antenna interference between different user's MAs, and that the sensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the communication performance."}

The best known bounds show that the support size of the capacity-achieving distribution is lower-bounded by a term of order $A$ and upper-bounded by a term of order $A^2$, where $A$ denotes the amplitude constraint. It was conjectured in [1] that the linear scaling is optimal. In this work, we establish a new lower bound of order $A\\sqrt{\\log A}$, improving the known bound and ruling out the conjectured linear scaling.\n  To obtain this result, we quantify the fact that the capacity-achieving output distribution is close to the uniform distribution in the interior of the amplitude constraint. Next, we introduce a wrapping operation that maps the problem to a compact domain and develop a theory of best approximation of the uniform distribution by finite Gaussian mixtures. These approximation bounds are then combined with stability properties of capacity-achieving distributions to yield the final support-size lower bound."}

Conventional satellite acquisition typically relies on time-domain beam sweeping, which incurs substantial overhead and latency. In this correspondence, we propose an efficient one-shot satellite acquisition framework that capitalizes on two phenomena traditionally regarded as impairments: i) Doppler effects and ii) beam-squint effects. Specifically, we derive a closed-form \\emph{rainbow beamformer} that leverages beam-squint effects to align frequency-dependent beam directions with satellite positions inferred from their Doppler shifts. This approach enables reception from multiple satellites at once without requiring beam sweeping. To extract satellite position information, we develop three Doppler-aware angle estimation algorithms based on received signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional beam sweeping approaches in both acquisition accuracy and required time slots. These gains stem from the ability of the proposed rainbow BF to exploit the \\emph{angle-dependent nature of Doppler shifts}, enabling full angular-domain coverage with a single pilot transmission and reception."}

In this study, we propose an EEG-to-Voice paradigm that directly reconstructs speech from non-invasive EEG signals without dynamic time warping (DTW) or explicit temporal alignment. The proposed pipeline generates mel-spectrograms from EEG in an open-loop manner using a subject-specific generator, followed by pretrained vocoder and automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules to synthesize speech waveforms and decode text. Separate generators were trained for spoken speech and imagined speech, and transfer learning-based domain adaptation was applied by pretraining on spoken speech and adapting to imagined speech. A minimal language model-based correction module was optionally applied to correct limited ASR errors while preserving semantic structure. The framework was evaluated under 2 s and 4 s speech conditions using acoustic-level metrics (PCC, RMSE, MCD) and linguistic-level metrics (CER, WER). Stable acoustic reconstruction and comparable linguistic accuracy were observed for both spoken speech and imagined speech. While acoustic similarity decreased for longer utterances, text-level decoding performance was largely preserved, and word-position analysis revealed a mild increase in decoding errors toward later parts of sentences. The language model-based correction consistently reduced CER and WER without introducing semantic distortion. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct, open-loop EEG-to-Voice reconstruction for spoken speech and imagined speech without explicit temporal alignment."}

Viewing covering as a form of quantization in general metric spaces, we introduce the notion of the average covering radius as a natural measure of average distortion, complementing the classical worst-case covering radius. By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks.\n  On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime.

The models were systematically trained and tested using data collected from IoT sensors of various environmental parameters like CO2, light. The experimental setup features 21 basil crops and uses Raspberry Pi and Arduino. 10k data points were collected and used to train and evaluate three ML models: Linear Regression (LR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The comparative analysis of the performance of each model revealed that, while LSTM showed high predictive capability and accuracy of 99%, its execution time was 10 times longer than LR and its RAM usage was about 3 times higher than DNN's when simulated on a standard CPU environment. Conversely, the DNN model had an accuracy rate of 98%. This proves an efficient balance between computational speed and prediction quality, which makes this model well-suited for real-life deployment. Moreover, LR excelled in fast processing of basic prediction with an execution time of 11 seconds. This makes the LR model more suitable for low-complexity or resource-limited applications.

Using the publicly available BEED: Bangalore EEG Epilepsy Dataset, we evaluate PaperNet under a clearly defined subject-independent training protocol and compare it against established and widely used lightweight baselines. The model achieves a macro-F1 of 0.96 on the held-out test set with approximately 0.6M parameters, while maintaining balanced performance across all four classes.

Channel-wise attention weights further offer insights into electrode relevance. Computational profiling shows that PaperNet remains efficient enough for practical deployment on resource-constrained systems through out the whole process.

We systematically analyze the impact of antenna geometry and spatial correlation using the Jakes' channel model for different AP array configurations, including uniform linear and planar arrays. We then derive SINR expressions for centralized and distributed uplink processing and obtain a closed-form uplink SE expression for centralized maximum-ratio combining using the use-and-then-forget bound. Finally, we propose an alternating-optimization framework to select FA port configurations that maximize the uplink sum SE.

We establish a dynamic channel model that captures the coexistence of quasi-static and dynamic scatterers, as well as the impacts of antenna rotation and synchronization errors. Based on this model, we formulate the problem of dynamic CKM construction within a Bayesian inference framework and design a two-stage approximate Bayesian inference algorithm. In stage I, a high-performance algorithm is developed to jointly infer quasi-static channel parameters and calibrate synchronization errors from historical measurements. In stage II, by leveraging the quasi-static parameters as informative priors, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to estimate dynamic parameters from limited real-time measurements. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling low-overhead, high-performance channel estimation in dynamic environments."}

The wireless synchronization protocol uses a two-tone waveform exchange for frequency synchronization and a bi-directional waveform exchange for time synchronization, independent of GPS. A Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) framework is developed to quantify the impact of synchronization offsets on joint delay and Doppler estimation, and consequently, on target localization and velocity estimation accuracy. Simulation results derived from the analytical expressions establish the extent to which the residual synchronization offsets degrade the MSR's performance. The performance of the synchronization links primarily depends on the synchronization-link channel and transmit parameters; optimizing these parameters enables the MSR configuration to surpass the monostatic performance and approach the ideal case.

However, the scarcity of wireless resources limits the capabilities of ICVs. Semantic Communication (SemCom) systems can alleviate this issue by extracting and transmitting task-relevant information, termed semantic information, instead of the entire raw data. Despite this, we reveal that residual redundancy persists within SemCom systems, where not all instances under the same semantic category are equally critical for downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, we introduce Instance Communication (InsCom), which elevates communication from the semantic level to the instance level for ICVs. Specifically, InsCom uses a scene graph generation model to identify all image instances and analyze their inter-relationships, thus distinguishing between semantically identical instances. Additionally, it applies user-configurable, task-critical criteria based on subject semantics and relation-object pairs to filter recognized instances. Consequently, by transmitting only task-critical instances, InsCom significantly reduces data redundancy, substantially enhancing transmission efficiency within limited wireless resources. Evaluations across various datasets and wireless channel conditions show that InsCom achieves a data volume reduction of over 7.82 times and a quality improvement ranging from 1.75 to 14.03 dB compared to the state-of-the-art SemCom systems."}

In contrast to existing research that treats phase shifts with errors (PSEs) and the PDAs separately, we introduce a remaining power (RP) metric to quantify the proportion of power preserved in the signals reflected by the RIS, and we prove its asymptotic convergence to theoretical values by leveraging extended Glivenko-Cantelli theorem. Then, the RP of signals passing through RIS pixels is jointly examined under combined phase and amplitude uncertainties. In addition, we propose four pixel reflection models to capture practical conditions, and we derive approximate polynomial upper bounds for the RP with error terms by applying Taylor expansion. Furthermore, based on Friis transmission formula and projected aperture, we propose a general NF channel model that incorporates the coupling between the PSEs and the PDAs. By using Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality and Riemann sums, we derive a closed-form upper bound on spectral efficiency, and the bound becomes tighter as the pixel area decreases. We reveal that as the RIS phase shifts approach the ends of their range, the RP under independent and identically distributed PEs is smaller than that under fully correlated PEs, whereas this relationship reverses when the phase shifts are near the middle of their range. Neglecting the PEs in the PDAs leads to an overestimation of the RIS performance gain, explaining the discrepancies between theoretical and measured results."}

Nevertheless, the generalizability of current deep learning-based CSI feedback algorithms cannot be guaranteed in unseen environments, which induces a high deployment cost. In this paper, the generalizability of deep learning-based CSI feedback is promoted with physics interpretation. Firstly, the distribution shift of the cluster-based channel is modeled, which comprises the multi-cluster structure and single-cluster response. Secondly, the physics-based distribution alignment is proposed to effectively address the distribution shift of the cluster-based channel, which comprises multi-cluster decoupling and fine-grained alignment. Thirdly, the efficiency and robustness of physics-based distribution alignment are enhanced. Explicitly, an efficient multi-cluster decoupling algorithm is proposed based on the Eckart-Young-Mirsky (EYM) theorem to support real-time CSI feedback. Meanwhile, a hybrid criterion to estimate the number of decoupled clusters is designed, which enhances the robustness against channel estimation error. Fourthly, environment-generalizable neural network for CSI feedback (EG-CsiNet) is proposed as a novel learning framework with physics-based distribution alignment. Based on extensive simulations and sim-to-real experiments in various conditions, the proposed EG-CsiNet can robustly reduce the generalization error by more than 3 dB compared to the state-of-the-arts."}

Conventional methods achieved heartbeat detection from different perspectives, where template matching (TM) and deep learning (DL) were based on the similarity of neighboring heartbeat episodes and robust spatio-temporal characteristics, respectively, and thus, performed varied from case to case. Inspired by the above facts, we propose confidence analysis-based hybrid heartbeat detection using both TM and DL, and further explore the advantages of both methods in various scenarios. To be specific, the confidence of the heartbeat detection results was evaluated by the consistency of signal morphology and the variability of the detected heartbeat intervals, which could be formulated by the averaged correlation between each heartbeat episode and the detected template and the normalized standard deviation among detected heartbeat intervals, respectively, where the results with higher confidence were remained. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method, we conducted experiments using practical clinical BCG dataset with 34 subjects including 924,235 heartbeats. Numerical results showed that the proposed hybrid method achieved an average absolute interval error of 20.73 ms, yielding a reduction of 29.28 ms and 10.13 ms compared to solo TM and DL methods, respectively. Besides, case study showed the robustness of heartbeat detection of TM and DL to individual differences and signal quality, respectively, and in turn, validated that the hybrid method could benefit from the complementary advantages of both methods, which demonstrated the superiority of the proposed hybrid method in practical BCG monitoring scenarios."}

In AIRT, autoencoders are widely used to enhance defect detection by reducing the dimensionality of thermal data and improving the signal-to-noise ratio. However, traditional AIRT autoencoders often struggle to disentangle subtle defect features from dominant background responses, leading to suboptimal defect analysis under varying material and inspection conditions. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a Masked CNN-Attention Autoencoder (AIRT-Masked-CAAE) that integrates convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms to capture both local thermal patterns and global contextual dependencies. The AIRT-Masked-CAAE introduces a masked sequence autoencoding strategy, where the network learns to infer missing thermal responses from surrounding contextual cues, while suppressing background redundancy. In addition, the proposed masked sequence autoencoding approach enables training on only a subset of the thermal sequence, while providing generalizable latent representations and reducing training time by a factor of 30. The AIRT-Masked-CAAE framework was evaluated using specimens made of PVC, CFRP, and PLA. The results demonstrate that the AIRT-Masked-CAAE surpasses state-of-the-art AIRT autoencoders in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and metrics based on neural networks."}

Specifically, we conceive a comprehensive ISAC architecture, where an UM-MIMO base station adopts OCDM waveform for communications and a co-located sensing receiver adopts the frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) detection principle to simplify the associated hardware. For sensing tasks, several OCDM subcarriers, namely, dedicated sensing subcarriers (DSSs), are each transmitted through a dedicated sensing antenna (DSA) within the transmit antenna array. By judiciously designing the DSS selection scheme and optimizing receiver parameters, the FMCW-based sensing receiver can decouple the echo signals from different DSAs with significantly reduced hardware complexity. This setup enables the estimation of ranges and velocities of near-field targets in an antenna-pairwise manner. Moreover, by leveraging the spatial diversity of UM-MIMO, we introduce the concept of virtual bistatic sensing (VIBS), which incorporates the estimates from multiple antenna pairs to achieve high-accuracy target positioning and three-dimensional velocity measurement. The VIBS paradigm is immune to hostile channel environments characterized by spatial non-stationarity and uncorrelated multipath environment. Furthermore, the channel estimation of UM-MIMO OCDM systems enhanced by the sensing results is investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ISAC scheme enhances sensing accuracy, and also benefits communication performance."}

Over-the-air computation (AirComp) technique leveraging analog transmission enables the aggregation of local updates directly over-the-air by exploiting the superposition properties of wireless multiple-access channel, thereby drastically reducing the communication bottleneck issues of FL compared with digital transmission schemes. This work points out that existing AirComp-FL overlooks a key practical constraint, the instantaneous peak-power constraints imposed by the non-linearity of radiofrequency power amplifiers. We present and analyze the effect of the classic method to deal with this issue, amplitude clipping combined with filtering. We investigate the effect of instantaneous peak-power constraints in AirComp-FL for both single-carrier and multi-carrier orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We highlight the specificity of AirComp-FL: the samples depend on the gradient value distribution, leading to a higher peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) than that observed for uniformly distributed signals. Simulation results demonstrate that, in practical settings, the instantaneous transmit power regularly exceeds the power-amplifier limit; however, by applying clipping and filtering, the FL performance can be degraded. The degradation becomes pronounced especially in multi-carrier OFDM systems due to the in-band distortions caused by clipping and filtering."}

Viewing covering as a form of quantization in general metric spaces, we introduce the notion of the average covering radius as a natural measure of average distortion, complementing the classical worst-case covering radius. By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks.\n  On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime.

We systematically analyze the impact of antenna geometry and spatial correlation using the Jakes' channel model for different AP array configurations, including uniform linear and planar arrays. We then derive SINR expressions for centralized and distributed uplink processing and obtain a closed-form uplink SE expression for centralized maximum-ratio combining using the use-and-then-forget bound.
