While most existing works focus on narrowband MA systems, this paper\ninvestigates MA position optimization for an MA-enhanced multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system.\nThis problem appears to be particularly challenging due to the frequency-flat\nnature of MA positioning, which should accommodate the channel conditions\nacross different subcarriers. To overcome this challenge, we discretize the\nmovement region into a multitude of sampling points, thereby converting the\ncontinuous position optimization problem into a discrete point selection\nproblem. Although this problem is combinatorial, we develop an efficient\npartial enumeration algorithm to find the optimal solution using a\nbranch-and-bound framework, where a graph-theoretic method is incorporated to\neffectively prune suboptimal solutions. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nregime, a simplified graph-based algorithm is also proposed to obtain the\noptimal MA positions without the need for enumeration.
