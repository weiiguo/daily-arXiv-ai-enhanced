### [1] [(SP)$^2$-Net: A Neural Spatial Spectrum Method for DOA Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15475)
*Lioz Berman,Sharon Gannot,Tom Tirer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为(SP)^2-Net的深度学习架构，用于从单次快照中估计多源到达方向(DOA)，克服了传统Bartlett波束形成器的孔径限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Bartlett波束形成器在单次快照场景下精度和分辨率受限于阵列孔径，且最大似然估计在源数量未知或较多时不实用，基于样本协方差的谱方法因缺乏多次快照而不适用。

Method: 设计深度神经网络架构，以测量数据和假设角度为输入，学习输出与更宽阵列能力一致的分数。采用新颖训练策略，在推理时通过扫描任意角度集生成热图。

Result: 提出的(SP)^2-Net模型在性能上优于Bartlett波束形成器和基于稀疏性的DOA估计方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习技术能够有效提升单次快照下的DOA估计性能，突破传统方法的孔径限制，为实际应用提供了高分辨率空间谱生成方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of
multiple sources from a single snapshot of an antenna array, a task with many
practical applications. In such settings, the classical Bartlett beamformer is
commonly used, as maximum likelihood estimation becomes impractical when the
number of sources is unknown or large, and spectral methods based on the sample
covariance are not applicable due to the lack of multiple snapshots. However,
the accuracy and resolution of the Bartlett beamformer are fundamentally
limited by the array aperture. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
technique, comprising a novel architecture and training strategy, for
generating a high-resolution spatial spectrum from a single snapshot.
Specifically, we train a deep neural network that takes the measurements and a
hypothesis angle as input and learns to output a score consistent with the
capabilities of a much wider array. At inference time, a heatmap can be
produced by scanning an arbitrary set of angles. We demonstrate the advantages
of our trained model, named (SP)$^2$-Net, over the Bartlett beamformer and
sparsity-based DOA estimation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波多用户MISO系统在高速移动场景下，信道相干时间极短，传统CSIT获取过程开销大，难以在有限时间内完成下行传输

Method: 提出CSIT-free酉预编码框架，设计符号检测方法，同时进行CSIR和多普勒频移估计，完全消除干扰

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了高速移动毫米波系统中的下行传输挑战，无需CSIT即可实现干扰消除和全合并增益

Abstract: This paper investigates the downlink (DL) transmission in millimeter-wave
(mmWave) multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems especially
focusing on a high speed mobile scenario. To complete the DL transmission
within an extremely short channel coherence time, we propose a novel DL
transmission framework that eliminates the need for channel state information
at the transmitter (CSIT), of which acquisition process requires a substantial
overhead, instead fully exploiting the given channel coherence time. Harnessing
the characteristic of mmWave channel and uniquely designed CSIT-free unitary
precoding, we propose a symbol detection method along with the simultaneous CSI
at the receiver (CSIR) and Doppler shift estimation method to completely cancel
the interferences while achieving a full combining gain. Via simulations, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing with the
existing baselines.

Conclusion: 基于OAM的毫米波联合雷达通信系统能够有效实现雷达参数估计和通信功能，为汽车雷达和车对车通信提供了一种创新的解决方案

Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) technology has attracted much research
interest in recent years because of its characteristic helical phase front
twisting around the propagation axis and natural orthogonality among different
OAM states to encode more degrees of freedom than classical planar beams.
Leveraging upon these features, OAM technique has been applied to wireless
communication systems to enhance spectral efficiency and radar systems to
distinguish spatial targets without beam scanning. Leveraging upon these unique
properties, we propose an OAM-based millimeter-wave joint radar-communications
(JRC) system comprising a bi-static automotive radar and vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) communications. Different from existing uniform circular array (UCA)
based OAM systems where each element is an isotropic antenna, an OAM spatial
modulation scheme utilizing a uniform linear array (ULA) is adopted with each
element being a traveling-wave antenna, producing multiple Laguerre-Gaussian
(LG) vortex beams simultaneously. Specifically, we first build a novel
bi-static automotive OAM-JRC model that embeds communication messages in a
radar signal, following which a target position and velocity parameters
estimation algorithm is designed with only radar frames. Then, an OAM-based
mode-division multiplexing (MDM) strategy between radar and JRC frames is
presented to ensure the JRC parameters identifiability and recovery.
Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the JRC system through deriving
recovery guarantees and Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of radar target
parameters and evaluating the bit error rate (BER) of communication,
respectively. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the
proposed OAM-based JRC system and parameter estimation method.

Conclusion: 提出的神经网络方法有效解决了雷达和通信发射器信号去交织的挑战，特别是在处理高度重叠和连续波信号方面表现出色

Abstract: Identification and further analysis of radar emitters in a contested
environment requires detection and separation of incoming signals. If they
arrive from the same direction and at similar frequencies, deinterleaving them
remains challenging. A solution to overcome this limitation becomes
increasingly important with the advancement of emitter capabilities. We propose
treating the problem as blind source separation in time domain and apply
supervisedly trained neural networks to extract the underlying signals from the
received mixture. This allows us to handle highly overlapping and also
continuous wave (CW) signals from both radar and communication emitters. We
make use of advancements in the field of audio source separation and extend a
current state-of-the-art model with the objective of deinterleaving arbitrary
radio frequency (RF) signals. Results show, that our approach is capable of
separating two unknown waveforms in a given frequency band with a single
channel receiver.

### [5] [Wireless Sensing with Movable Intelligent Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15627)
*Ziyuan Zheng,Qingqing Wu,Yanze Zhu,Wen Chen,Ying Gao,Honghao Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种低成本可移动智能表面(MIS)用于无线感知，通过机械重配置代替电子相位调谐，实现多波束模式用于多目标检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可重构智能表面(RIS)的电子相位调谐硬件成本高、功耗大，需要开发更经济高效的无线感知解决方案

Abstract: Future wireless networks are envisioned to deliver not only gigabit
communications but also ubiquitous sensing. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) have emerged to reshape radio propagation, recently showing considerable
promise for wireless sensing. Still, their per-element electronic tuning incurs
prohibitive hardware cost and power consumption. Motivated by the concept of
fluid antenna system (FAS), this paper introduces a low-cost movable
intelligent surface (MIS) for wireless sensing, which replaces element-wise
electronic phase tuning with panel-wise mechanical reconfiguration. The MIS
stacks a large fixed and a smaller movable pre-phased metasurface layers, whose
differential position shifts synthesize distinct composite phase patterns,
enabling multiple beam patterns for multi-target detection. We characterize a
MIS-enabled multi-hop echo signal model with multi-target interference and then
formulate a worst-case sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
maximization problem that jointly designs MIS phase shifts and schedules MS2's
position. A Riemannian Augmented Lagrangian Method (RALM)-based algorithm is
developed to solve the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem. We also
derive a heuristic MIS beam steering design with closed-form phase distribution
and position scheduling. Simulations validate MIS's beam pattern
reconfiguration capability, show that the RALM-based scheme significantly
outperforms the closed-form scheme in improving sensing SINR, and uncover a
gain-diversity trade-off in beam patterns that informs the optimal choice of
MIS configuration.

Result: 方法通过三个交叉指数锥形缝隙天线的示例布局进行了验证

Conclusion: 该方法为稀疏天线阵列的系统优化提供了有效途径，能够显著提升设备的定位性能

Abstract: In increasing number of electronic devices implement wideband radio
technologies for localization and sensing purposes, like ultra-wideband (UWB).
Such radio technologies benefit from a large number of antennas, but space for
antennas is often limited, especially in devices for mobile and IoT
applications. A common challenge is therefore to optimize the placement and
orientations of a small number of antenna elements inside a device, leading to
the best localization performance. We propose a method for systematically
approaching the optimization of such sparse arrays by means of Cram\'er-Rao
lower bounds (CRLBs) and vector spherical wave functions (VSWFs). The VSWFs
form the basis of a wideband signal model considering frequency, direction and
polarization-dependent characteristics of the antenna array under test (AUT),
together with mutual coupling and distortions from surrounding obstacles. We
derive the CRLBs for localization parameters like delay and angle-of-arrival
for this model under additive white Gaussian noise channel conditions, and
formulate optimization problems for determining optimal antenna positions and
orientations via minimization of the CRLBs. The proposed optimization procedure
is demonstrated by means of an exemplary arrangement of three Crossed
Exponentially Tapered Slot (XETS) antennas.

of the two-way antenna gain of the radar and accurate simulation of the radar
cross section of chosen reflectors, realistic modeling of the baseband receive
signal in complex scenarios is achieved.

TL;DR: 提出扩展k-u小尺度衰落模型，通过新增参数改进原k-u模型，在毫米波LoS场景下比k-u模型和扩展n-u模型具有更准确的建模能力和更好的数学可处理性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有k-u模型在描述毫米波频段小尺度衰落时存在局限性，特别是在多径簇不平衡场景下需要更准确的建模方法

Result: 扩展k-u模型在所有测试场景下均比k-u模型和扩展n-u模型获得更小的均方误差，成功推导出概率密度函数、累积分布函数、任意阶矩和矩生成函数等关键统计特性的闭式表达式

Conclusion: 扩展k-u模型在毫米波LoS通信场景中提供了更准确的小尺度衰落建模，具有更好的数学可处理性，为通信系统性能指标分析提供了理论基础

Abstract: This study proposes a small-scale fading model, named the extended k-u model,
which incorporates the imbalance of multipath clusters by adding a new
parameter based on the original k-u model. The extended k-u model outperforms
the k-u model in characterizing small-scale fading in the millimeter-wave
(mmWave) band and has more accurate modeling capability than the extended n-u
model in scenarios with line-of-sight (LoS) paths. And it is mathematically
more tractable than the a-k-n-u model. Experiments are conducted for mmWave
communication scenarios with LoS paths, covering the outdoor 28 GHz band, the
indoor 65 GHz band, and the indoor 92 GHz band. The results demonstrate that
the extended k-u model achieves a smaller mean square error in fitting the
measured data compared to both the k-u model and the extended n-u model across
all scenarios. In addition, through theoretical derivations, closed-form
expressions are obtained for the key statistical characteristics of the
extended k-u model, including the probability density function, cumulative
distribution function, moments of arbitrary order, and moment generating
function. Based on these statistics, this study further derives and analyzes
the expressions for some performance metrics of the communication system,
including the amount of fading, the probability of outage, and the average bit
error rate.

Conclusion: 提出的联合无线信号增强与识别框架在挑战性条件下有效，为现代无线通信网络提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Wireless signal recognition (WSR) is crucial in modern and future wireless
communication networks since it aims to identify the properties of the received
signal in a no-collaborative manner. However, it is challenging to accurately
classify signals in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and distributed
network settings. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed multi-task
learning framework for joint wireless signal enhancement and recognition
(WSER), addressing the crucial need for non-collaborative signal identification
in modern wireless networks. Our approach integrates a wireless signal
enhancement and recognition network (WSERNet) with FedProx+, an enhanced
federated learning algorithm designed for heterogeneous data distributions.
Specifically, WSERNet leverages an asymmetric convolution block (ACBlock) to
capture long-range dependencies in the input signal and improve the performance
of the deep learning model. FedProx+ introduces a proximal term to the loss
function to encourage the model updates to be closer to the previous model,
enhancing the convergence speed and robustness of federated learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for joint
WSER, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under
both centralized and distributed settings including independent and identically
distributed (IID) and non-IID data distributions.

### [10] [Explainable Deep Learning Based Adversarial Defense for Automatic Modulation Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15766)
*Peihao Dong,Jingchun Wang,Shen Gao,Fuhui Zhou,Qihui Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SHAP可解释性增强的对抗性微调防御方案(SHAP-AFT)，用于保护自动调制分类网络免受对抗攻击，通过检测攻击、评估信息重要性和对抗微调三个阶段实现有效防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在自动调制分类中应用广泛，但精心设计的AMC神经网络容易受到各种对抗攻击，由于泛化能力和计算成本的限制，这些攻击难以处理。需要从揭示攻击对网络影响的角度开发可解释的防御方案。

Method: 提出SHAP-AFT方案，包含三个阶段：攻击检测、信息重要性评估和对抗性微调。首先检测攻击存在，然后使用负Shapley值评估接收数据的贡献并移除由攻击引起的主导负信息对应的数据位置，最后使用精炼的接收数据模式基于对抗适应样本对AMC网络进行微调。

Result: 仿真结果表明，Shapley值作为关键指标的有效性，以及所提出的SHAP-AFT方案在面对不同类型和强度的攻击时具有优越的防御性能。

Conclusion: SHAP-AFT方案通过可解释的Shapley值分析，成功实现了对自动调制分类网络的对抗攻击防御，为深度学习在通信安全领域的应用提供了有效的保护机制。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been widely applied to enhance automatic modulation
classification (AMC). However, the elaborate AMC neural networks are
susceptible to various adversarial attacks, which are challenging to handle due
to the generalization capability and computational cost. In this article, an
explainable DL based defense scheme, called SHapley Additive exPlanation
enhanced Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SHAP-AFT), is developed in the perspective of
disclosing the attacking impact on the AMC network. By introducing the concept
of cognitive negative information, the motivation of using SHAP for defense is
theoretically analyzed first. The proposed scheme includes three stages, i.e.,
the attack detection, the information importance evaluation, and the AFT. The
first stage indicates the existence of the attack. The second stage evaluates
contributions of the received data and removes those data positions using
negative Shapley values corresponding to the dominating negative information
caused by the attack. Then the AMC network is fine-tuned based on adversarial
adaptation samples using the refined received data pattern. Simulation results
show the effectiveness of the Shapley value as the key indicator as well as the
superior defense performance of the proposed SHAP-AFT scheme in face of
different attack types and intensities.

*Haofan Dong,Ozgur B. Akan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文建立了太赫兹低地球轨道卫星间链路集成感知通信系统的理论分析框架，揭示了系统性能受硬件限制而非功率限制的特性，发现功率放大器非线性是主要瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析太赫兹LEO卫星间链路ISAC系统的根本性能极限，建立统一的端到端信号模型来捕捉轨道动力学、硬件损伤和波束指向误差的综合影响

Method: 开发统一的端到端信号模型，通过贝叶斯克拉美-罗下界(BCRLB)分析推导距离和距离变化率的极限感知精度，并推导通信容量上限的闭式表达式

Result: 发现感知精度随载波频率呈二次方(1/f_c^2)改善，但受信号相关硬件失真限制；通信性能受硬件限制而非功率限制，功率放大器非线性比其他损伤严重1-2个数量级

Conclusion: 在亚太赫兹频段(200-600 GHz)可能存在有利的操作条件，其中频率的二次感知增益与硬件质量下降达到平衡，功率放大器非线性是主要性能瓶颈

Abstract: This paper establishes a theoretical framework for analyzing the fundamental
performance limits of terahertz (THz) Low Earth Orbit (LEO) inter-satellite
link (ISL) Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) systems. We develop a
unified, end-to-end signal model that, jointly captures the effects of extreme
orbital dynamics, cascaded non-ideal hardware impairments, and micro-radian
beam pointing errors. Through Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (BCRLB)
analysis, we derive the ultimate sensing accuracy for range and range-rate,
revealing a quadratic ($1/f_c^2$) improvement in estimation variance with
carrier frequency, which is ultimately floored by signal-dependent hardware
distortion. For communication, we show that system performance is not
power-limited but hardware-limited, deriving a closed-form capacity ceiling
under the joint effect of phase noise and PA nonlinearity: $C_{\text{sat}} =
\log_2(1 + e^{-\sigma_\phi^2}/\Gamma_{\text{eff}})$, where
$\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$ is a proposed hardware quality factor. Our numerical
results, based on state-of-the-art component data and the identified
trade-offs, suggest that favorable operational conditions may exist in the
sub-THz frequency range (200-600 GHz) where the quadratic sensing gain with
frequency is balanced against hardware quality degradation. Power Amplifier
(PA) nonlinearity emerges as the dominant performance bottleneck, exceeding
other impairments by one to two orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: 提出了具有噪声加干扰抑制能力的增强型无线信道基础模型架构，通过NPI估计和消除模块处理降级CSI，提高下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WCFM模型使用完美CSI数据训练，但实际部署中只能获得有噪声的降级CSI，导致特征表示无法反映真实信道特性，造成下游任务性能下降

Method: 首先获取粗略CSI估计，计算两个投影矩阵提取接收信号中的NPI项，通过NPI估计和消除模块处理，最后通过CSI补全网络获得干净的CSI用于特征提取

Conclusion: 提出的NPI抑制架构有效解决了实际部署中降级CSI导致的性能退化问题，为WCFM在实际系统中的实用化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Wireless channel foundation model (WCFM) is a task-agnostic AI model that is
pretrained on large-scale wireless channel datasets to learn a universal
channel feature representation that can be used for a wide range of downstream
tasks related to communications and sensing. While existing works on WCFM have
demonstrated its great potentials in various tasks including beam prediction,
channel prediction, localization, etc, the models are all trained using perfect
(i.e., error-free and complete) channel information state (CSI) data which are
generated with simulation tools. However, in practical systems where the WCFM
is deployed, perfect CSI is not available. Instead, channel estimation needs to
be first performed based on pilot signals over a subset of the resource
elements (REs) to acquire a noisy version of the CSI (termed as degraded CSI),
which significantly differs from the perfect CSI in some real-world
environments with severe noise and interference. As a result, the feature
representation generated by the WCFM is unable to reflect the characteristics
of the true channel, yielding performance degradation in downstream tasks. To
address this issue, in this paper we propose an enhanced wireless channel
foundation model architecture with noise-plus-interference (NPI) suppression
capability. In our approach, coarse estimates of the CSIs are first obtained.
With these information, two projection matrices are computed to extract the NPI
terms in the received signals, which are further processed by a NPI estimation
and subtraction module. Finally, the resultant signal is passed through a CSI
completion network to get a clean version of the CSI, which is used for feature
extraction. Simulation results demonstrated that compared to the
state-of-the-art solutions, WCFM with NPI suppression structure achieves
improved performance on channel prediction task.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MoE-CE是一个基于混合专家框架的信道估计方法，通过多个专家子网络和动态路由机制，在多变无线环境中显著提升深度学习方法的一般化能力，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在多变无线环境（如不同SNR、RB数量和信道配置）中难以有效一般化，特别是在多任务和零样本场景下表现不佳。

Method: 提出MoE-CE框架，使用多个专家子网络分别处理不同信道特性，通过学习的路由器动态选择最相关的专家，不依赖于特定骨干模型和学习算法。

Result: 在多样化SNR、RB数量和信道配置的合成数据集上，MoE-CE在多任务和零样本评估中始终优于传统DL方法，获得显著性能提升并保持效率。

Conclusion: MoE-CE框架通过提供适当的归纳偏置和动态专家选择机制，有效提升了信道估计方法在动态无线环境中的一般化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Reliable channel estimation (CE) is fundamental for robust communication in
dynamic wireless environments, where models must generalize across varying
conditions such as signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the number of resource blocks
(RBs), and channel profiles. Traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods
struggle to generalize effectively across such diverse settings, particularly
under multitask and zero-shot scenarios. In this work, we propose MoE-CE, a
flexible mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework designed to enhance the
generalization capability of DL-based CE methods. MoE-CE provides an
appropriate inductive bias by leveraging multiple expert subnetworks, each
specialized in distinct channel characteristics, and a learned router that
dynamically selects the most relevant experts per input. This architecture
enhances model capacity and adaptability without a proportional rise in
computational cost while being agnostic to the choice of the backbone model and
the learning algorithm. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets
generated under diverse SNRs, RB numbers, and channel profiles, including
multitask and zero-shot evaluations, we demonstrate that MoE-CE consistently
outperforms conventional DL approaches, achieving significant performance gains
while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: PCG方法能够收敛到一阶临界点，在保持快速收敛的同时显著降低了计算和内存复杂度，特别适用于Hessian矩阵具有谱聚类特性的非凸复合优化问题。

Abstract: This work studies a composite minimization problem involving a differentiable
function q and a nonsmooth function h, both of which may be nonconvex. This
problem is ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning yet remains
challenging to solve efficiently, particularly when large-scale instances, poor
conditioning, and nonconvexity coincide. To address these challenges, we
propose a proximal conjugate gradient method (PCG) that matches the fast
convergence of proximal (quasi-)Newton algorithms while reducing computation
and memory complexity, and is especially effective for spectrally clustered
Hessians. Our key innovation is to form, at each iteration, an approximation to
the Newton direction based on CG iterations to build a majorization surrogate.
We define this surrogate in a curvature-aware manner and equip it with a
CG-derived isotropic weight, guaranteeing majorization of a local second-order
model of q along the given direction. To better preserve majorization after the
proximal step and enable further approximation refinement, we scale the CG
direction by the ratio between the Cauchy step length and a step size derived
from the largest Ritz value of the CG tridiagonal. All curvature is accessed
via Hessian-vector products computed by automatic differentiation, keeping the
method Hessian-free. Convergence to first-order critical points is established.
Numerical experiments on CS-MRI with nonconvex regularization and on dictionary
learning, against benchmark methods, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于捏合天线系统(PASS)的安全组播通信框架，通过联合优化发射和捏合波束成形来最大化保密组播速率，在单组和多组组播场景下均优于传统固定位置天线架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究捏合天线系统(PASS)中的安全组播通信，通过自适应调整波导上的天线位置来改善组播安全性，解决传统固定位置天线架构在安全性能上的局限性。

Method: 采用交替优化框架：单组组播使用元素级顺序优化方法更新捏合波束成形器，发射波束成形器通过半定松弛(SDR)或Dinkelbach-ADMM方法设计；多组组播在主最小化(MM)框架下交替优化，使用SDR或SOCP方法获取发射波束成形器，通过MM-based元素级顺序更新策略更新捏合波束成形器。

Result: 数值结果表明：(i)PASS在各种配置下始终优于传统固定位置天线架构的保密性能；(ii)随着服务区域增大、天线阵列规模扩大以及用户和窃听者密度增加，PASS相对于固定位置架构的性能优势更加显著。

Conclusion: PASS系统通过动态调整天线位置实现了显著的安全性能提升，特别是在大规模、高密度场景下表现出色，为安全组播通信提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This article investigates secure multicast communications in pinching-antenna
systems (PASS), where pinching beamforming is enabled by adaptively adjusting
pinching antenna (PAs) positions along waveguides to improve multicast
security. Specifically, a PASS-based secure multicast framework is proposed, in
which joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming is conducted to
maximize the secrecy multicast rate. i) For the single-group multicast
scenario, an alternating optimization (AO) framework is employed, where the
pinching beamformer is updated via an element-wise sequential optimization
method. The transmit beamformer is designed via a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
formulation for an upper-bound solution, while a Dinkelbach-alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) offers a low-complexity alternative. ii)
For the multi-group multicast scenario, transmit and pinching beamformers are
alternately optimized under a majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The
transmit beamformer is obtained via SDR or an efficient second-order cone
programming (SOCP) method, while the pinching beamformer is updated through
MM-based element-wise sequential update strategy. Numerical results are
provided to demonstrate that: (i) PASS consistently outperform conventional
fixed-location antenna architectures in terms of secrecy performance across
various configurations; and (ii) the performance advantage of PASS over
fixed-location architectures becomes more significant with increased service
region, larger antenna arrays, and higher user and eavesdropper densities.

TL;DR: 本研究首次在潜没式叶轮上部署封装加速度计进行原位振动监测，通过机器学习分析在油浸环境中实现了91.3%的故障检测准确率，显著优于传统表面传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电机安装的加速度计无法检测暴露在恶劣井下环境中的潜没叶轮故障，需要开发能够直接在恶劣环境下监测关键部件的方法。

Method: 在实验室规模的泵装置中使用1米油浸没设置，在正常和模拟故障条件下收集振动数据，并使用传统和深度学习的机器学习模型套件进行分析。

Result: 叶轮安装传感器达到91.3%的平均准确率和0.973 AUC-ROC，明显优于最好的非浸没传感器，且封装不会造成显著的性能损失。

Conclusion: 这种首创的原位监测系统证明，封装保护的叶轮安装传感器能够可靠检测关键潜没泵部件的故障，实现更早的故障检测，减少非计划停机时间。

Abstract: Vertical turbine pumps in oil and gas operations rely on motor-mounted
accelerometers for condition monitoring. However, these sensors cannot detect
faults at submerged impellers exposed to harsh downhole environments. We
present the first study deploying encapsulated accelerometers mounted directly
on submerged impeller bowls, enabling in-situ vibration monitoring. Using a
lab-scale pump setup with 1-meter oil submergence, we collected vibration data
under normal and simulated fault conditions. The data were analyzed using a
suite of machine learning models -- spanning traditional and deep learning
methods -- to evaluate sensor effectiveness. Impeller-mounted sensors achieved
91.3% average accuracy and 0.973 AUC-ROC, outperforming the best non-submerged
sensor. Crucially, encapsulation caused no statistically significant
performance loss in sensor performance, confirming its viability for
oil-submerged environments. While the lab setup used shallow submergence,
real-world pump impellers operate up to hundreds of meters underground -- well
beyond the range of surface-mounted sensors. This first-of-its-kind in-situ
monitoring system demonstrates that impeller-mounted sensors -- encapsulated
for protection while preserving diagnostic fidelity -- can reliably detect
faults in critical submerged pump components. By capturing localized vibration
signatures that are undetectable from surface-mounted sensors, this approach
enables earlier fault detection, reduces unplanned downtime, and optimizes
maintenance for downhole systems in oil and gas operations.

Abstract: At least ten emerging providers are developing satellite navigation systems
for low Earth orbit (LEO). Compatibility with existing GNSS in L-band is
critical to their successful deployment and for the larger ecosystem. Xona is
deploying Pulsar, a near 260-satellite LEO constellation offering dual L-band
navigation services near L1 and L5. Designed for interoperability, Pulsar
provides centimeter-level accuracy, resilience, and authentication, while
maintaining a format that existing GNSS receivers can support through a
firmware update. This study examines Pulsar's compatibility with GPS and
Galileo by evaluating C/N0 degradation caused by the introduction of its X1 and
X5 signals. Using spectrally compact QPSK modulation, Pulsar minimizes
interference despite higher signal power. Theoretical analysis is supported by
hardware testing across a range of commercial GNSS receivers in both lab-based
simulation and in-orbit live-sky conditions. The study confirms Pulsar causes
no adverse interference effects to existing GNSS, supporting coexistence and
integration within the global PNT ecosystem.

Conclusion: 多RIS辅助的RF-FSO混合通信模型能有效提升IoT应用在复杂环境中的安全性能，为6G无线通信提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to their ability to dynamically control the propagation environment,
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a promising solution to
address the challenges of $6$G wireless communication, especially in the
context of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This paper investigates a mixed
communication model with multi-RIS-aided radio frequency (RF)-free space optics
(FSO) to enhance the performance of IoT applications in complex environments.
An eavesdropper is assumed to be present, attempting to intercept confidential
information transmitted over the RF link. All RF links are modeled using Rician
fading, while the FSO link accounts for M\'alaga turbulence with pointing
errors, capturing real-world propagation conditions. Closed-form analytical
expressions are derived for the secrecy outage probability, average secrecy
capacity, and effective secrecy throughput in terms of Meijer's G function. To
gain further insight, high signal-to-noise approximations of these metrics are
also presented. Numerical results highlight the importance of heterodyne
detection in mitigating the adverse effects of pointing errors on the FSO link.
Moreover, integrating a multi-RIS structure into the proposed model
significantly increases secrecy performance, achieving up to a $47.67\%$
improvement in SOP compared to conventional methods. Finally, the derived
analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: This work introduces and investigates finite blocklength fluid antenna
systems (FBL-FASs). To meet the stringent key performance indicators (KPIs) of
6G and beyond networks, including ultra-massive machine-type communications
(mMTC), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and enhanced mobile
broadband (eMBB), it is necessary to evaluate the performance of FAS under
limited channel uses across time, frequency, and other domains. By exploiting
random matrix theory and extreme value theory (EVT), we characterize the effect
of finite blocklength on key metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), via accurate estimation
of interference caused by codeword correlation. Closed-form expressions for
block error rate (BLER) and outage probability are derived, covering both
conditional BLER (with channel state information, CSI) and statistical BLER
(without CSI). The proposed analysis leverages Chernoff bounds and introduces a
Taylor-expansion-assisted mean value theorem for integrals (MVTI) to reduce
computational complexity. Numerical results show that, compared with
conventional multi-antenna systems, the proposed FBL-FAS framework achieves
higher energy and spectral efficiency under finite blocklength, making it a
promising enabler for next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: 发散波束训练范式为近场大规模天线阵列提供了一种高效准确的波束训练解决方案，显著降低了训练开销并提高了性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates beam training techniques for near-field (NF)
extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs). Existing NF beam training methods
predominantly rely on beam focusing, where the base station (BS) transmits
highly spatially selective beams to locate the user equipment (UE). However,
these beam-focusing-based schemes suffer from both high beam sweeping overhead
and limited accuracy in the NF, primarily due to the narrow beams' high
susceptibility to misalignment. To address this, we propose a novel NF beam
training paradigm using diverging beams. Specifically, we introduce the beam
diverging effect and exploit it for low-overhead, high-accuracy beam training.
First, we design a diverging codeword to induce the beam diverging effect with
a single radio frequency (RF) chain. Next, we develop a diverging polar-domain
codebook (DPC) along with a hierarchical method that enables angular-domain
localization of the UE with only 2 log_2(N) pilots, where N denotes the number
of antennas. Finally, we enhance beam training performance through two
additional techniques: a DPC angular range reduction strategy to improve the
effectiveness of beam diverging, and a pilot set expansion method to increase
overall beam training accuracy. Numerical results show that our algorithm
achieves near-optimal accuracy with a small pilot overhead, outperforming
existing methods.

Conclusion: 基于波束发散效应的新型波束训练方法有效解决了大规模UPA系统在近场环境下的波束训练挑战，为6G毫米波通信提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: In future 6G communication systems, large-scale antenna arrays promise
enhanced signal strength and spatial resolution, but they also increase the
complexity of beam training. Moreover, as antenna counts grow and carrier
wavelengths shrink, the channel model transits from far-field (FF) planar waves
to near-field (NF) spherical waves, further complicating the beam training
process. This paper focuses on millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems equipped with
large-scale uniform planar arrays (UPAs), which produce 3D beam patterns and
introduce additional challenges for NF beam training. Existing methods
primarily rely on either FF steering or NF focusing codewords, both of which
are highly sensitive to mismatches in user equipment (UE) location, leading to
high sensitivity to even slight mismatch and excessive training overhead. In
contrast, we introduce a novel beam training approach leveraging the
beam-diverging effect, which enables adjustable wide-beam coverage using only a
single radio frequency (RF) chain. Specifically, we first analyze the spatial
characteristics of this effect in UPA systems and leverage them to construct
hierarchical codebooks for coarse UE localization. Then, we develop a 3D
sampling mechanism to build an NF refinement codebook for precise beam
training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves
superior beam training performance while maintaining low training overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能处理有限记忆的马尔可夫过程，但现实系统中存在概率性"时间跳跃"现象，即状态t+1可能依赖于遥远过去t-d的状态，这给影响图学习带来了挑战

Method: 基于RecGreedy算法进行改进，提出了PIMRecGreedy方法。该方法不假设记忆长度，不需要事先知道d值，也不需要知道时间跳跃发生的具体时间索引

Result: 该方法能够以高概率恢复影响图G，且不对图结构施加任何约束

Conclusion: PIMRecGreedy算法成功解决了具有概率时间跳跃的高维马尔可夫过程影响图学习问题，为这类复杂系统的建模提供了有效工具

Abstract: Learning the influence graph G of a high-dimensional Markov process is a
challenging problem. Prior work has addressed this task when the process has
finite memory. However, the more general regime in which the system
probabilistically "jumps back in time" - so that the state at t+1 depends on a
sample from a distant past t-d - remains unexplored. The process with
probabilistic resets can be modeled as a Markov process with memory, but
estimations become computationally expensive. To tackle this, we introduce
PIMRecGreedy, a modification of the RecGreedy algorithm originally designed for
i.i.d. samples. The proposed method does not assume memory, requires no prior
knowledge of d, and recovers G with high probability even without access to the
specific time indices at which such temporal jumps occur, and without imposing
any constraints on the graph structures.

Conclusion: LQG控制系统可有效作为隐式通信信道，在保证控制性能的同时实现可靠通信，分离原理的发现为实际应用提供了简化设计的理论基础。

Abstract: This paper studies implicit communication in linear quadratic Gaussian
control systems. We show that the control system itself can serve as an
implicit communication channel, enabling the controller to transmit messages
through its inputs to a receiver that observes the system state. This
communication is considered implicit because (i) no explicit communication
channels are needed; and (ii) information is transmitted while simultaneously
fulfilling the controller's primary objective--maintaining the control cost
within a specified level. As a result, there exists an inherent trade-off
between control and communication performance. This trade-off is formalized
through the notion of implicit channel capacity, which characterizes the
supremum reliable communication rate subject to a constraint on control
performance. We characterize the implicit channel capacity in three settings.
When both the controller and the receiver have noiseless observations of the
system state, the channel capacity admits a closed-form expression. When only
the controller has noiseless observations, the channel capacity is given by the
solution of a convex optimization. When both the controller and the receiver
have noisy observations, we establish a lower bound on the implicit capacity.
Surprisingly, when the controller has noiseless observations, the
capacity-achieving input policy adheres to a separation principle, allowing the
control and channel coding tasks to be addressed independently, without loss of
optimality. Moreover, under this capacity-achieving input policy, the implicit
channel can be equivalently translated into a Gaussian MIMO channel, enabling
the use of existing channel codes to achieve implicit communication.
