### [1] [An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15045)
*Homa Nikbakht,Yonina C. Eldar,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于双基地MIMO的ISAC系统，用于检测和优先处理URLLC消息，并通过DPC技术优化干扰管理，显著提升了eMBB传输速率并满足URLLC和感知需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中，ISAC技术能够实现联合感知与通信，支持智能城市和自动驾驶等应用。这些应用对URLLC的需求迫切，因此需要设计一种系统来优先处理时间敏感任务并确保低延迟高可靠性通信。

Method: 提出了一种双基地MIMO ISAC系统，通过SR检测目标并触发URLLC消息传输。采用DPC技术减少eMBB和感知信号的干扰，并探讨了两种URLLC干扰处理方法。

Result: 数值分析表明，基于DPC的ISAC方案在有限块长度（FBL）下显著优于功率共享和传统时间共享方案，实现了更高的eMBB传输速率，同时满足URLLC和感知约束。

Conclusion: 该研究为ISAC支持的URLLC系统提供了有效的干扰管理和性能优化方案，验证了其在6G网络中的潜力。

Abstract: In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as
a key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and
communication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs
facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving.
Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication
(URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive
targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability
constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of
URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station
(BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is
deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS
regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to
the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a
target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional
URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper
coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and
sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for
handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive
interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the
rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by
evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of
the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our
numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly
outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular,
it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and
sensing constraints.

### [2] [MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers: Capacity-Achieving Architectures with Reduced Circuit Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15052)
*Matteo Nerini,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图论的MiLAC模型，设计了低复杂度的stem-connected MiLAC架构，显著降低了电路复杂度，同时保持了容量性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决巨型MIMO系统中完全连接MiLAC的电路复杂度高的问题，以实现高性能、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出图论模型，设计stem-connected MiLAC架构，并通过闭式解优化其性能。

Result: 理论分析和数值模拟表明，stem-connected MiLAC在保持容量性能的同时，电路复杂度线性增长。

Conclusion: stem-connected MiLAC是一种高性能、可扩展的巨型MIMO解决方案。

Abstract: To meet the demands of future wireless networks, antenna arrays must scale
from massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to gigantic MIMO, involving
even larger numbers of antennas. To address the hardware and computational cost
of gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from
the digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers
(MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming
through reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on
fully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via
tunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving,
their circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components,
scales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality.
To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of
MiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC
architectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a
family of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while
drastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize
stem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our
theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that
stem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that
scales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance,
scalable, gigantic MIMO.

### [3] [Linear and Numerical SDoF Bounds of Active RIS-Assisted MIMO Wiretap Interference Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15073)
*Su Linfan,Miao Yuhang,Song Yuxuan,Zheng Shuo,Zhang Tong,Xu Yinfei,Wang Shuai,Li Na*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了RIS辅助的MIMO窃听干扰信道的安全自由度（SDoF），提出了通过线性波束成形和数值方法得到的上下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RIS辅助的MIMO窃听干扰信道的SDoF，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Result: 提出的下界优于现有基准，且在对称天线配置下得到闭式下界。

Conclusion: 数值模拟显示上下界在许多天线配置下一致，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap interference channel (IC)
serves as a canonical model for information-theoretic security, where a
multiple-antenna eavesdropper attempts to intercept communications in a
two-user MIMO IC system. The secure degrees-of-freedom (SDoF) of an active
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted MIMO wiretap IC is with
practical interests but remains unexplored. In this paper, we establish both
sum-SDoF lower and upper bounds through linear beamforming conditions and
numerical methods. Specifically, our proposed lower bound is derived from
transmission scheme design and corresponding solutions to the sum-SDoF
maximization problem, formulated by linear integer programming. The solutions
to this optimization problem addresses RIS element allocation for leakage and
interference cancellation. The proposed upper bound is obtained by solving a
nuclear norm minimization problem, leveraging the fact that nuclear norm serves
as a convex relaxation of the rank function. For symmetry antenna
configurations, we derive a closed-form lower bound. Extensive numerical
simulations show that our proposed lower and upper bounds coincide across many
antenna configurations, and our proposed lower bound outperforms the existing
benchmark.

### [4] [New Constructions of Full Flag Codes Based on Partial Spreads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15127)
*Xiang Han,Xinran Li,Gang Wang*

Main category: cs.IT

Method: 基于部分展开构造全标志码，结构类似“三明治”，包含一个伴随矩阵层和两个部分展开层。

Result: 构造的码具有最大距离（最优距离标志码）和次大距离（准最优距离标志码）等特性。

Conclusion: 提出的构造方法和解码算法为标志码的实际应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Flag codes are a class of multishot network codes comprising sequences of
nested subspaces (flags) within the vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, where $q$ is
a prime power. In this paper, we propose a family of constructions for full
flag codes based on partial spreads. The distances of this family include
maximum distance (optimum distance flag codes), second-maximum distance
(quasi-optimum distance flag codes), as well as other feasible values. The
structure of these flag codes resembles that of a \textquotedblleft sandwich",
consisting of one layer of companion matrix and two layers of partial spreads.
Furthermore, we present an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes.

### [5] [LLM Agent for Hyper-Parameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15167)
*Wanzhe Wang,Jianqiu Peng,Menghao Hu,Weihuang Zhong,Tong Zhang,Shuai Wang,Yixin Zhang,Mingjie Shao,Wanli Ni*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进WS-PSO-CM算法在无人机轨迹和通信中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前WS-PSO-CM算法的超参数调优方法依赖启发式，自动化程度低且性能不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一个LLM代理，通过迭代框架和模型上下文协议（MCP）自动调优超参数，包括设置代理配置文件、驱动探索和自主终止循环。

Result: 实验表明，LLM代理生成的超参数在最小和速率上显著优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: LLM代理结合PSO知识和WS-PSO-CM算法背景，能有效找到高性能超参数。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

### [6] [In-Context Learning for Gradient-Free Receiver Adaptation: Principles, Applications, and Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15176)
*Matteo Zecchin,Tomer Raviv,Dileep Kalathil,Krishna Narayanan,Nir Shlezinger,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.IT

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在无线接收器自适应中灵活性不足或需要显式优化，ICL提供了一种更高效且无需在线训练的方法。

Method: 研究了基于Transformer和结构化状态空间模型（SSMs）的ICL架构框架，并将其应用于无蜂窝大规模MIMO网络。

Result: 理论和实证研究表明，ICL是一种高效且原则性的方法，能够利用导频信号和上下文信息实现实时自适应。

Conclusion: ICL为无线接收器的动态适应提供了一种无需在线训练的可行解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.

### [7] [New Bounds and Constructions for Variable Packet-Error Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15233)
*Xiangliang Kong,Xin Wang,Ron M. Roth,Itzhak Tamo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了可变分组错误编码问题，提出了动态纠错能力的编码设计，并给出了两种具体构造方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络通信中多路径传输时动态变化的错误数量问题。

Method: 提供了可变分组错误编码方案的速率-失真权衡界限，并提出了两种构造方法：基于高阶MDS码和重复码变体。

Result: 第一种构造在一般参数范围内优于已知结果，第二种构造在特定参数范围内达到最优速率-失真权衡。

Conclusion: 本文提出的编码方案在动态错误环境下具有优越性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of variable packet-error coding, which
emerges in network communication scenarios where a source transmits information
to a destination through multiple disjoint paths. The objective is to design
codes with dynamic error-correcting capabilities that adapt to varying numbers
of errors. Specifically, we first provide several bounds on the
rate--distortion trade-off for general variable packet-error coding schemes.
Then, we present two explicit constructions of variable packet-error coding
schemes. The first construction uses higher-order MDS codes and provides a
coding scheme that achieves a better rate--distortion trade-off compared to
known results for general parameter regimes. The second construction is based
on a variant of the repetition code and yields a coding scheme with an optimal
rate--distortion trade-off, with respect to our bound, for certain parameter
regimes.

### [8] [Golden Partition Zone: Rethinking Neural Network Partitioning Under Inversion Threats in Collaborative Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15412)
*Rongke Liu,Youwen Zhu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何在协作推理中通过模型分区和标签平滑增强对模型反转攻击（MIA）的抵抗性，同时最小化精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注浅层保护，但会导致显著的效用损失。研究目标是找到最佳模型分区策略以平衡MIA抵抗力和模型精度。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了神经网络中表征转换对条件熵的影响，并实验验证了在表征转换或决策层分割的效果。此外，采用正标签平滑压缩类内方差。

Result: 实验表明，在表征转换或决策层分割时，MIA的均方误差增加四倍以上，显著增强抵抗力。标签平滑进一步提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 决策层特征在增强反转模型下仍具韧性，且辅助数据类型影响转换边界和重建行为。

Abstract: In collaborative inference, intermediate features transmitted from edge
devices can be exploited by adversaries to reconstruct original inputs via
model inversion attacks (MIA). While existing defenses focus on shallow-layer
protection, they often incur significant utility loss. A key open question is
how to partition the edge-cloud model to maximize resistance to MIA while
minimizing accuracy degradation. We first show that increasing model depth
alone does not guarantee resistance. Through theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that representational transitions in neural networks cause sharp
changes in conditional entropy $H(x\mid z)$, with intra-class variance (denoted
$R_c^2$) and feature dimensionality as critical factors. Experiments on three
representative deep vision models demonstrate that splitting at the
representational-transition or decision-level layers increases mean squared
error by more than four times compared to shallow splits, indicating
significantly stronger resistance to MIA. Positive label smoothing further
enhances robustness by compressing $R_c^2$ and improving generalization.
Finally, we validate the resilience of decision-level features under enhanced
inversion models and observe that the type of auxiliary data influences both
transition boundaries and reconstruction behavior.

### [9] [Towards Weight Distribution-Aware Polar Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15467)
*Mohammad Rowshan,Vlad-Florin Dragoi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文探讨了无需预变换的极化码结构，通过权重贡献偏序设计具有更好权重分布的极化类似码，避免了搜索或优化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极化码基于子信道可靠性的信息论构造方法导致权重分布较差，现有预变换方法（如CRC极化码和PAC码）虽能改善，但本文旨在探索无需预变换的改进方法。

Method: 利用权重贡献偏序指导设计极化类似码，避免使用搜索或优化算法。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法在一系列预变换和非预变换码上均表现出改进。

Conclusion: 通过权重贡献偏序设计极化类似码，可有效改善权重分布，且无需预变换或复杂算法。

Abstract: Polar codes are constructed based on the reliability of sub-channels
resulting from the polarization effect. However, this information-theoretic
construction approach leads to a poor weight distribution. To address this
issue, pre-transformed polar codes, such as CRC-polar codes and PAC codes, have
been employed. In this paper, we focus on the structure of polar codes without
applying any pre-transformations and explore methods, guided by the
weight-contribution partial order, to design polar-like codes with enhanced
weight distribution, notably without employing any search or optimization
algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate improvement over a range of codes
both with and without pre-transformation.

### [10] [Out-of-Band Modality Synergy Based Multi-User Beam Prediction and Proactive BS Selection with Zero Pilot Overhead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15136)
*Kehui Li,Binggui Zhou,Jiajia Guo,Feifei Gao,Guanghua Yang,Shaodan Ma*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉和位置协同的OOB模态协同（OMS）方案，用于多用户毫米波通信中的波束预测和基站选择，显著减少信令开销并提高协调效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多用户毫米波通信中，多基站协调和多用户波束跟踪导致高信令开销和协调延迟，现有OOB模态方法在单基站系统中有效，但在多基站系统中未充分探索。

Method: 通过视觉和位置反馈的空间对齐识别用户，利用图像序列的时间相关性跟踪用户，设计BEM-GBPN网络预测波束增益和最优波束，实现主动基站选择和波束切换。

Result: 仿真结果表明，OMS方案实现了91%的最优传输速率，零导频开销，显著提高了多基站协调效率。

Conclusion: OMS方案通过协同视觉和位置模态，有效解决了多基站系统中的波束预测和协调问题，为未来密集部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-user millimeter-wave communication relies on narrow beams and dense
cell deployments to ensure reliable connectivity. However, tracking optimal
beams for multiple mobile users across multiple base stations (BSs) results in
significant signaling overhead. Recent works have explored the capability of
out-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless
channels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user
systems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense
cell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing
overhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to
eliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in
multi-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
OOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize
multi-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB
modalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially
identified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and
then tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence.
Subsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network
(BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for
mobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to
perform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the
proposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS
selection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the
optimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS
coordination efficiency compared to existing methods.

### [11] [Probabilistic Trajectory GOSPA: A Metric for Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Object Tracking Performance Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15148)
*Yuxuan Xia,Ángel F. García-Fernández,Johan Karlsson,Yu Ge,Lennart Svensson,Ting Yuan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种广义化的轨迹最优子模式分配（GOSPA）度量方法，用于评估提供轨迹估计的多目标跟踪算法，并考虑了轨迹级的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多目标跟踪算法需要更全面的评估指标，以同时考虑目标状态的存在和估计不确定性。

Method: 基于概率GOSPA度量，将其扩展为多维分配问题，并通过线性规划松弛实现多项式时间计算。

Result: 新度量方法保留了TGOSPA的可解释性，并能分解为直观的成本项，如定位误差、存在概率不匹配误差等。

Conclusion: 通过仿真研究验证了所提度量方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal
sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking
algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties.
This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to
account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual
object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a
multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming
relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time.
Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show
that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected
localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly
detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch
error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a
simulation study.

### [12] [Enhancing eLoran Timing Accuracy via Machine Learning with Meteorological and Terrain Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15235)
*Taewon Kang,Seunghyeon Park,Pyo-Woong Son,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了eLoran/GPS时间差（TD）的估计方法，提出了一种结合加权线性回归（WLR）和各向异性广义回归神经网络（AGRNN）的模型WLR-AGRNN，以提高eLoran的定时精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）易受信号干扰，需要互补的定位、导航和定时（PNT）系统。eLoran作为GNSS的补充，但其主要误差源是信号传播延迟（ASF），受地面导电性和天气条件影响。

Method: 通过时间间隔计数器测量GPS与eLoran的TD，分析其与11种气象因素的相关性，提出WLR-AGRNN模型，结合WLR和AGRNN捕捉线性和非线性关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，WLR-AGRNN模型在四个月的数据中表现优于其他模型，显著提高了TD估计精度。

Conclusion: WLR-AGRNN模型有效提升了eLoran/GPS TD的估计准确性，为eLoran实现与GPS相当的定时精度提供了可能。

Abstract: The vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to signal
interference have increased the demand for complementary positioning,
navigation, and timing (PNT) systems. To address this, South Korea has decided
to deploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system as a complementary
PNT solution. Similar to GNSS, eLoran provides highly accurate timing
information, which is essential for applications such as telecommunications,
financial systems, and power distribution. However, the primary sources of
error for GNSS and eLoran differ. For eLoran, the main source of error is
signal propagation delay over land, known as the additional secondary factor
(ASF). This delay, influenced by ground conductivity and weather conditions
along the signal path, is challenging to predict and mitigate. In this paper,
we measure the time difference (TD) between GPS and eLoran using a time
interval counter and analyze the correlations between eLoran/GPS TD and eleven
meteorological factors. Accurate estimation of eLoran/GPS TD could enable
eLoran to achieve timing accuracy comparable to that of GPS. We propose two
estimation models for eLoran/GPS TD and compare their performance with existing
TD estimation methods. The proposed WLR-AGRNN model captures the linear
relationships between meteorological factors and eLoran/GPS TD using weighted
linear regression (WLR) and models nonlinear relationships between outputs from
expert networks through an anisotropic general regression neural network
(AGRNN). The model incorporates terrain elevation to appropriately weight
meteorological data, as elevation influences signal propagation delay.
Experimental results based on four months of data demonstrate that the
WLR-AGRNN model outperforms other models, highlighting its effectiveness in
improving eLoran/GPS TD estimation accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文研究了未来无线网络中异构服务间的资源共享，提出了一种基于强化学习的双Q学习方法优化物联网设备的传输策略，显著提升了延迟性能。


<details>

Conclusion: 提出的RL方法在异构服务资源共享中表现优异，可根据流量动态选择最优策略。

Abstract: Flexible and efficient wireless resource sharing across heterogeneous
services is a key objective for future wireless networks. In this context, we
investigate the performance of a system where latency-constrained
internet-of-things (IoT) devices coexist with a broadband user. The base
station adopts a grant-free access framework to manage resource allocation,
either through orthogonal radio access network (RAN) slicing or by allowing
shared access between services. For the IoT users, we propose a reinforcement
learning (RL) approach based on double Q-Learning (QL) to optimise their
repetition-based transmission strategy, allowing them to adapt to varying
levels of interference and meet a predefined latency target. We evaluate the
system's performance in terms of the cumulative distribution function of IoT
users' latency, as well as the broadband user's throughput and energy
efficiency (EE). Our results show that the proposed RL-based access policies
significantly enhance the latency performance of IoT users in both RAN Slicing
and RAN Sharing scenarios, while preserving desirable broadband throughput and
EE. Furthermore, the proposed policies enable RAN Sharing to be
energy-efficient at low IoT traffic levels, and RAN Slicing to be favourable
under high IoT traffic.

Conclusion: 提出的系统能有效增强城市环境中的连接性，支持高效数据卸载，为未来网络设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper studies a high-altitude platform (HAP) network supported by
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The practical irregular placement
of HAPs and RISs is modeled using homogeneous Poisson point processes, while
buildings that cause blockages in urban areas are modeled as a Boolean scheme
of rectangles. We introduce a novel approach to characterize the statistical
channel based on generalized Beta prime distribution. Analytical expressions
for coverage probability and ergodic capacity in an interference-limited system
are derived and validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings show
notable performance improvements and reveal the impact of various system
parameters, including blockages effect which contribute in mitigating
interference from the other visible HAPs. This proposed system could enhance
connectivity and enable effective data offloading in urban environments.

Abstract: In practical systems, recorded analog signals must be digitized for

While prior studies have examined quantization effects in various signal

particularly in one-dimensional (1D) first-order configurations, remains
unexplored. This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on
performance of first-order 1D DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical
expression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D DMA has been
formulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array
performance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF),
Front-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and null depth (ND). Simulation results reveal that
beampattern shape remains structurally invariant across quantization bit
depths, with quantization primarily affecting ND. DF and FBR remain constant
with the varying number of quantization bits. Additionally, ND is shown to be
frequency-independent; however, it increases with increasing quantization bit
depths, enhancing interference suppression. The study also examines the effect
of steering nulls across the azimuthal range, showing that ND degrades as the
null moves closer to the source look direction, indicating reduced interference
suppression.

Motivation: 随着高频段大规模天线阵列的部署，未来无线通信系统可能在辐射近场中运行。近场波束聚焦能够在有限深度的空间区域内实现空间复用，这与远场波束导向不同。

Method: 本文推导了广义URA的波束深度，并定义了有效波束聚焦瑞利距离（EBRD）来表征近场边界。通过分析阵列几何形状对EBRD和波束深度的影响，研究了近场波束聚焦的可行性。

Result: 分析表明，方形URA的波束深度最窄，但EBRD最大的是宽或高的URA。尽管方形URA波束深度窄，但其EBRD受限可能导致多用户总速率下降。仿真结果显示，宽或高的URA的总速率是方形URA的3.5倍。

Conclusion: 宽或高的URA因其扩展的EBRD和增强的空间复用能力，在近场波束聚焦中表现优于方形URA。

Abstract: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequency bands, future
wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative
near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused
within a spatial region of finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in both
the angular and range dimensions. This paper derives the beamdepth for a
generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry
influences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field
beamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of
beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective
beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis
reveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is
maximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a
square URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely
constrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a
sum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended
EBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities.

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) with gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (gMIMO)
technology operating in the upper mid-band frequency range (7-24 GHz). The
near-field propagation achieved by gMIMO introduces unique opportunities for

including advanced channel estimation techniques, precoding strategies, and
dynamic array configurations such as sparse and modular arrays. Through
analytical insights and a case study, this paper demonstrates the feasibility
of achieving optimized energy harvesting and data throughput in dense and

Internet-of-Everything (IoE) deployments, smart factory networks, and other
energy-autonomous applications aligned with the goals of next-generation
wireless technologies.
