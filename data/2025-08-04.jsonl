The appendices present\ndetailed mathematical derivations and proofs that support the analytical\nframework of the main paper. Specifically, we include: (i) cumulative\ndistribution functions for ordered channel gains; (ii) probability density\nfunctions of normalized signal-plus-interference variances in NOMA dynamic SIC\ndecoding; (iii) closed-form expressions for pairwise error probability (PEP)\nwith two users; (iv) probability derivations for channel gain ordering in the\ntwo-UE case, specifically when UE 1 and UE 2 have the strongest or second\nstrongest channel gains; (v) BER analysis for M-QAM modulation schemes\nincluding BPSK, 4QAM, 16QAM and 64QAM; (vi) PDF derivations for channel gains\nunder various ordering conditions; and (vii) challenges of PDF derivations for\nreal part of channel gain under various ordering condition. These mathematical\nfoundations enable the closed-form BER analysis of uplink NOMA systems with\ndynamic SIC decoding under Rayleigh fading channels, supporting analytical\nexpressions for various modulation schemes and system configurations."}

However, the\ncombination of near-field spherical wave propagation and frequency-dependent\nbeam split effects in wideband scenarios poses significant challenges for CSI\nrepresentation and compression. This paper proposes WideNLNet-CA, a\nrate-adaptive deep learning framework designed to enable efficient CSI feedback\nin wideband near-field XL-MIMO systems. WideNLNet-CA introduces a lightweight\nencoder-decoder architecture with multi-stage downsampling and upsampling,\nincorporating computationally efficient residual blocks to capture complex\nmulti-scale channel features with reduced overhead. A novel compression ratio\nadaptive module with feature importance estimation is introduced to dynamically\nmodulate feature selection based on target compression ratios, enabling\nflexible adaptation across a wide range of feedback rates using a single model.\nEvaluation results demonstrate that WideNLNet-CA consistently outperforms\nexisting compressive sensing and deep learning-based works across various\ncompression ratios and bandwidths, while maintaining fast inference and low\nmodel storage requirements."}
