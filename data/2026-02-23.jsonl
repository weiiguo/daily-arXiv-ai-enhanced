This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of deep neural network architectures for automated arrhythmia classification, integrating temporal modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble strategies. To address data scarcity in minority classes, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset was augmented using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We developed and compared four distinct architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), CNN combined with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), CNN-LSTM with Attention, and 1D Residual Networks (ResNet-1D), to capture both local morphological features and long-term temporal dependencies. Performance was rigorously evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 95\\% confidence intervals to ensure statistical robustness, while Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to validate model interpretability. Experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM model achieved the optimal stand-alone balance between sensitivity and specificity, yielding an F1-score of 0.951. Conversely, the CNN-LSTM-Attention and ResNet-1D models exhibited higher sensitivity to class imbalance. To mitigate this, a dynamic ensemble fusion strategy was introduced; specifically, the Top2-Weighted ensemble achieved the highest overall performance with an F1-score of 0.958. These findings demonstrate that leveraging complementary deep architectures significantly enhances classification reliability, providing a robust and interpretable foundation for intelligent arrhythmia detection systems."}

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel flexible coupler array that incorporates additional degrees of freedom (DoF) in radiation pattern reconfiguration and enhanced communication coverage with low hardware cost. Specifically, a new form of mechanical beamforming can be obtained by moving only the passive coupling elements while keeping the active antenna stationary. In addition, the flexible coupler antenna can slide along a rail toward users, thereby enhancing communication coverage. To fully exploit the potential of the flexible coupler array, we formulate a two-timescale sum-rate maximization problem with statistical channel state information (CSI). The antenna position is optimized based on scattering cluster-core statistics in the slow timescale, while mechanical beamforming is optimized based on multipath channel statistics in the fast timescale, subject to movement and energy constraints. To address the coupling between timescales and the high cost of extensive channel sampling, we develop a digital agent framework that leverages an electromagnetic (EM) map to generate statistical channel information for different user and antenna positions. Then, a deep neural network is trained to learn a slow-fast performance (SFP) surrogate. Mechanical beamforming at the fast timescale is obtained by selecting per-antenna radiation patterns from a predefined dictionary via a convex relaxation. Simulation results verify the performance gains achieved by the proposed flexible coupler array and the digital-agent-assisted algorithm."}

In pilot-aided transmission (PAT), a non-negligible fraction of the packet is consumed by pilots, creating a direct pre-log loss and tightening the reliability margin needed for ultra-reliable low-latency communication. We propose a pilot-free polar-coded framework that replaces explicit pilots with \\emph{coded pilots}. The message is carried by two polar-coded segments: a quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) segment that is decodable without channel state information (CSI), and a higher-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) segment that provides high spectral efficiency. The receiver employs \\emph{hybrid decoding}: it first jointly infers CSI during successive-cancellation-based decoding of the QPSK segment by exploiting QPSK phase-rotation invariance together with polar frozen-bit constraints; the decoded QPSK symbols then act as \\emph{implicit pilots} for coherent detection and decoding of the QAM segment. The split also makes rate adaptation practical by confining the symmetry/frozen-bit requirements for phase resolution to the QPSK segment, enabling puncturing and shortening without breaking the pilot-free mechanism. For multi-block fading, we optimize the split and code parameters via density evolution with Gaussian approximation (DEGA); for higher-order modulation, we use bit-interleaved coded modulation capacity approximation to obtain equivalent channel parameters. Incorporating channel-estimation error variance into the DEGA-based analysis, simulations over practical multi-block block-fading channels show gains up to $1.5$~dB over PAT in the short-blocklength regime."}

Towards this issue, we adopt the Stackelberg game formulation to model the strategic interaction between the legitimate side and the adversary, acting as the leader and follower, respectively. We prove the existence of the game equilibrium and adopt the backward induction method for equilibrium analysis. We first derive the optimal jamming policy as the follower's best response, which is then incorporated into the legitimate-side optimization for robust anti-jamming design. We address the uncertainty issue and reformulate the legitimate-side problem by exploiting the error bounds to combat the worst-case jamming attacks. The problem is decomposed within a block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM) framework to tackle the power allocation, transceiving beamforming, and active reflection, respectively, which are iterated towards the robust jamming mitigation scheme.

The receiver (Rx), on the other hand, operates in a pervasive near field (NF), enabled by a very large effective array aperture.

This design attains the required aperture with only a few widely spaced antenna elements while avoiding grating lobes in the composite Tx-Rx response. We analytically characterize the NF range-angle response of this architecture and study the interplay between NF effects and waveform bandwidth. This leads to the definition of a super-resolution region, where NF propagation at the Rx dominates the achievable range resolution and surpasses the classical, bandwidth-limited resolution. As a case study, we consider an extended target modeled as a collection of scatterers and assess localization performance via maximum-likelihood estimation.

Under this model, the tracking lost issue arising from the misalignment between the pencil-like beams and the true target positions is inevitable, especially when the trajectories of the targets are complex, and the conventional Kalman filter-based scheme does not work well. To deal with this issue, we propose a Transformer-based mmWave multi-target tracking framework, namely m3TrackFormer, with a novel re-acquisition mechanism, such that even if the echo signals from some targets are too weak to extract sensing information, we are able to re-acquire their locations quickly with small beam sweeping overhead. Specifically, the proposed framework can operate in two modes of normal tracking and target re-acquisition during the tracking procedure, depending on whether the tracking lost occurs. When all targets are hit by the swept beams, the framework works in the Normal Tracking Mode (N-Mode) with a Transformer encoder-based Normal Tracking Network (N-Net) to accurately estimate the positions of these targets and predict the swept beams in the next time block. While the tracking lost happens, the framework will switch to the Re-Acquisition Mode (R-Mode) with a Transformer decoder-based Re-Acquisition Network (RNet) to adjust the beam sweeping strategy for getting back the lost targets and maintaining the tracking of the remaining targets. Thanks to the ability of global trajectory feature extraction, the m3TrackFormer can achieve high beam prediction accuracy and quickly re-acquire the lost targets, compared with other tracking methods."}

In the two-path case, increased aperture sharpens the mainlobe but also intensifies sidelobes and leakage, yielding competing peaks and, in some regimes, a dominant peak shifted from the true delay. Finally, a normalized leakage metric is introduced to predict problematic separations and to identify regimes where local Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis does not capture practical peak-leakage behavior in delay estimation."}

The MD-AirComp scheme has proven effective in federated edge learning and is highly compatible with current digital wireless networks. However, it depends on channel pre-equalization, which may amplify computation errors in the presence of channel estimation inaccuracies, thus limiting its practical use. In this paper, we propose a blind MD-AirComp+ scheme, which takes advantage of the channel hardening effect in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We provide an upper bound on the computation mean square error, analyze the trade-off between computation accuracy and communication overhead, and determine the optimal quantization level. Additionally, we introduce a deep unfolding algorithm to reduce the computational complexity of solving the underdetermined detection problem formulated as a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator optimization problem. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed MD-AirComp+ framework, the optimal quantization selection strategy, and the low-complexity detection algorithm."}

Under this model, the tracking lost issue arising from the misalignment between the pencil-like beams and the true target positions is inevitable, especially when the trajectories of the targets are complex, and the conventional Kalman filter-based scheme does not work well. To deal with this issue, we propose a Transformer-based mmWave multi-target tracking framework, namely m3TrackFormer, with a novel re-acquisition mechanism, such that even if the echo signals from some targets are too weak to extract sensing information, we are able to re-acquire their locations quickly with small beam sweeping overhead. Specifically, the proposed framework can operate in two modes of normal tracking and target re-acquisition during the tracking procedure, depending on whether the tracking lost occurs. When all targets are hit by the swept beams, the framework works in the Normal Tracking Mode (N-Mode) with a Transformer encoder-based Normal Tracking Network (N-Net) to accurately estimate the positions of these targets and predict the swept beams in the next time block. While the tracking lost happens, the framework will switch to the Re-Acquisition Mode (R-Mode) with a Transformer decoder-based Re-Acquisition Network (RNet) to adjust the beam sweeping strategy for getting back the lost targets and maintaining the tracking of the remaining targets. Thanks to the ability of global trajectory feature extraction, the m3TrackFormer can achieve high beam prediction accuracy and quickly re-acquire the lost targets, compared with other tracking methods."}

Traditional empirical models often lack environment-awareness, while deep learning approaches are frequently constrained by the scarcity of large-scale training datasets. This work leverages the inherent sparsity of wireless propagation to model scenario-specific channels by identifying a discrete set of virtual signal sources. We propose a novel Greedy Sequential Sparse Bayesian Learning (GS-SBL) framework that bridges the gap between the computational efficiency of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and the robust uncertainty quantification of SBL. Unlike standard top-down SBL, which updates all source hyperparameters simultaneously, our approach employs a ``Micro-SBL'' architecture. We sequentially evaluate candidate source locations in isolation by executing localized, low-iteration SBL loops and selecting the source that minimizes the $L_2$ residual error. Once identified, the source and its corresponding power are added to the support set, and the process repeats on the signal residual to identify subsequent sources. Experimental results on real-world 3D propagation data demonstrate that the GS-SBL framework significantly outperforms OMP in terms of generalization. By utilizing SBL as a sequential source identifier rather than a global optimizer, the proposed method preserves Bayesian high-resolution accuracy while achieving the execution speeds necessary for real-time 3D path loss characterization."}

However, a major issue for multi-BD-RISassisted communication lies in the channel estimation overhead - the channel coefficients associated with the off-diagonal elements in each BD-RIS's scattering matrix as well as those associated with the reflection links among BD-RISs have to be estimated. In this paper, we propose an efficient channel estimation framework for double-BD-RIS-assisted multi-user multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we reveal that high-dimensional cascaded channels are characterized by five low-dimensional matrices by exploiting channel correlation properties. Based on this novel observation, in the ideal noiseless case, we develop a channel estimation scheme to recover these matrices sequentially and characterize the closed-form overhead required for perfect estimation as a function of the numbers of users and each BD-RIS's elements and channel ranks, which is with the same order as that in double-diagonal-RIS-aided communication systems. This exciting result implies the superiority of cooperative BD-RIS-aided communication over the diagonal- RIS counterpart even when channel estimation overhead is considered. We further extend the proposed scheme to practical noisy scenarios and provide extensive numerical simulations to validate its effectiveness."}

Roads are modeled using a Poisson Line Process (PLP), with multi-layer roadside access points (APs) deployed via 1-D Poisson Point Process (PPP). Each user forms a localized cell-free cluster by associating with the nearest AP in each layer along its corresponding road. This forms a road-constrained cell-free architecture. To enhance coverage, UAV act as an aerial tier, extending access from 1-D road-constrained layouts (embedded in 2-D) to 3-D. We employ a Matérn Hard-Core (MHC) point process to model the spatial distribution of UAV base stations, ensuring a minimum safety distance between them. In order to enable tractable analysis of the aggregate signal from multiple APs, a distance-based power control scheme is introduced. Leveraging tools from stochastic geometry, we have studied the coverage probability. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key system parameters on coverage performance, providing useful insights into the deployment and optimization of UAV-assisted cell-free vehicular networks."}

This paper investigates the jamming mitigation by leveraging an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS), where the channel uncertainties are particularly addressed for robust anti-jamming design. Towards this issue, we adopt the Stackelberg game formulation to model the strategic interaction between the legitimate side and the adversary, acting as the leader and follower, respectively. We prove the existence of the game equilibrium and adopt the backward induction method for equilibrium analysis. We first derive the optimal jamming policy as the follower's best response, which is then incorporated into the legitimate-side optimization for robust anti-jamming design. We address the uncertainty issue and reformulate the legitimate-side problem by exploiting the error bounds to combat the worst-case jamming attacks. The problem is decomposed within a block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM) framework to tackle the power allocation, transceiving beamforming, and active reflection, respectively, which are iterated towards the robust jamming mitigation scheme. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in protecting the legitimate transmissions under uncertainties, and the superior performance in terms of jamming mitigation as compared with the baselines."}
