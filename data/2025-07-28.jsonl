The corresponding information theoretic model for\nthe uplink (from the wireless users to the CP) is a multiaccess-relay channel\nwith primitive oblivious relays. The relays (RUs) are oblivious, as they are\nagnostic of the users codebooks, and primitive, since the fronthaul links (from\nRUs to CP) are error-free with limited capacity. This class of networks has\nbeen intensely studied in the information theoretic literature, where several\napproximated or exact (under certain conditions) capacity results have been\nderived. In particular, in the Gaussian case, the model has been analyzed for\nfixed and known channel state. This paper is motivated by the fact that, in\npractice, the channel state is a random process, and it is estimated at the\nbase station side through uplink pilot symbols sent by the users. The pilot\ndimension may take up a large portion of the channel coherence block, i.e., the\nnumber of symbols over which the channel state remains approximately constant.\nHence, sending both pilot and data symbols from the relays to the CP may\nrequire a significant overhead, especially when the fronthaul capacity is\nsmall.

In this paper, we consider a 6DMA-equipped base station (BS) and\naim to maximize the average sum logarithmic rate of all users served by the BS\nby jointly designing 6DMA surface positions and rotations based on statistical\nchannel information (SCI). Different from prior works on 6DMA design which use\nalternating optimization to iteratively update surface positions and rotations,\nwe propose a new sequential optimization method that first determines the\noptimal rotations and then identifies feasible positions to realize these\nrotations under practical antenna placement constraints. Simulation results\nshow that our proposed optimization scheme significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity of conventional alternating optimization (AO), while\nachieving communication performance comparable to the AO-based approach and\nsuperior to existing fixed-position/rotation antenna arrays."}

This makes\nsuch an attack one of the most feasible approaches to carrying out collusion.\nIn order to trace all the colluders, several types of multimedia fingerprinting\ncodes were introduced to construct fingerprints resistant to averaging attacks\non multimedia contents, such as AND anti-collusion codes (AND-ACCs), binary\nseparable codes (SCs), logical anti-collusion codes (LACCs), binary frameproof\ncodes (FPCs), binary strongly-separable codes (SSCs) and binary secure code\nwith list decoding (SCLDs). Then codes with the rate as high as possible are\ndesired. However, the existing fingerprinting codes have low code rate due to\nthe strong combinatorial structure. The reason is that the previous research\nmethods adopted simple tracing algorithms. In this paper, we first propose\nnovel tracing algorithms and then find appropriate fingerprinting codes with\nweaker combinatorial structure, i.e., the binary strongly identifiable parent\nproperty code for multimedia fingerprinting (SMIPPC) and its concatenated code.\nTheoretical comparisons and numerical comparisons show that SMIPPCs have higher\ncode rates than those of the existing codes due to their weaker combinatorial\nstructures. It is worth noting that SMIPPCs can only trace a part of colluders\nby using the previous tracing algorithm and the concatenated SMIPPC may be not\nan SMIPPC. This implies that our tracing algorithms have strong traceability."}

By leveraging large volumes of low-precision measurements, we show\nhow traditionally costly constraints, such as matrix semi-definiteness and rank\nconditions, become redundant, yielding simple overdetermined linear feasibility\nproblems. We illustrate key algorithms, theoretical guarantees via the Finite\nVolume Property, and the sample abundance singularity phenomenon, where\ncomputational complexity sharply drops."}

The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined\nin the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to\nthe analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining\nsamplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of\npatches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets,\nand eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures\northogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to\nproperly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar\nwavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can\nefficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a\ndefinition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction.\nWe support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs\nwhose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation,\nwe combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful\npatches, with landmark \\texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional\nembeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness,\nscalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable\napproximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet\napproaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity."}
