The proposed\nmethod preserves the linear-time complexity of standard BP decoder while\nimproving the logical error rate. To further reduce the logical error rate, a\nnew decision rule is introduced for the post-processing list decoder,\noutperforming the conventional least-metric selector (LMS) criterion.

In addition, we explore a new\nsubclass of BB codes, that we refer to as the univariate bicycle (UB) codes,\nspecifically with lower-weight parity checks (\\(w=6,8\\)).

Most existing anti-jamming methods\nrely on the assumption of accurate sensing and optimize parameters on a single\ntimescale. However, such methods overlook two practical issues: mismatched\nexecution latencies across heterogeneous actions and measurement errors caused\nby sensor imperfections. Especially for deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based\nmethods, the inherent sensitivity of neural networks implies that even minor\nperturbations in the input can mislead the agent into choosing suboptimal\nactions, with potentially severe consequences. To ensure reliable wireless\ntransmission, we establish a multi-timescale decision model that incorporates\nstate uncertainty. Subsequently, we propose two robust schemes that sustain\nperformance under bounded sensing errors. First, a Projected Gradient\nDescent-assisted Double Deep Q-Network (PGD-DDQN) algorithm is designed, which\nderives worst-case perturbations under a norm-bounded error model and applies\nPGD during training for robust optimization.

Further, each local tracker can communicate with all\nother trackers, where each of them can exchange their estimate and finally a\nconsensus is reached. We propose a weighted harmonic mean density (HMD) based\ntracking to reach a consensus and provide a solution for the fusion of Gaussian\ndensities. In this approach, optimal weights are assigned by minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence measure. Performance of the proposed method is\nmeasured using root mean square error, percentage of track divergence, and\nnormalized estimation error squared. Simulation results demonstrate that the\noptimized HMD-based fusion outperforms existing fusion methods during a\ndistributed tracking."}

Although the background channel does\nnot carry direct ST information, its accurate modeling is critical for\nevaluating sensing performance, especially in complex environments. Existing\ncommunication standards characterize propagation between separated transmitter\n(Tx) and receiver (Rx).

In this paper, we firstly conduct ISAC monostatic background channel\nmeasurements for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz. Realistic channel parameters are\nextracted, revealing pronounced single-hop propagation and discrete multipath\ndistribution. Inspired by these properties, a novel stochastic model is\nproposed to characterizing the ISAC monostatic background channel as the\nsuperposition of sub-channels between the monostatic Tx&Rx and multiple\ncommunication Rx-like Reference Points (RPs).
