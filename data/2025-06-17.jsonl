Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance\ncomplexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used\nperformance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information, fail to capture\nthe suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate\nperformance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool\nfor analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use\nmismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat\ninterference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics.\nSpecifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under\ninterference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be\nmatched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched\ncapacity is derived using Mutual Information (MI), while a lower bound on the\nmismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using the\nGeneralized Mutual Information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the\nproposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in\nBit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that\nGMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput performance of BICM-type systems.\nFinally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases,\nwith an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder\noptimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In\nshort, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference,\nproposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance\nevaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference."}

Recent\nresearch demonstrates that RSMA can maintain its superiority without relying on\nSuccessive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers. In practical systems,\nSIC-free receivers are more attractive than SIC receivers because of their low\ncomplexity and latency. This paper evaluates the theoretical limits of RSMA\nwith and without SIC receivers under finite constellations. We first derive the\nconstellation-constrained rate expressions for RSMA. We then design algorithms\nbased on projected subgradient ascent to optimize the precoders and maximize\nthe weighted sum-rate or max-min fairness (MMF) among users. To apply the\nproposed optimization algorithms to large-scale systems, one challenge lies in\nthe exponentially increasing computational complexity brought about by the\nconstellation-constrained rate expressions. In light of this, we propose\nmethods to avoid such computational burden. Numerical results show that, under\noptimized precoders, SIC-free RSMA leads to minor losses in weighted sum-rate\nand MMF performance in comparison to RSMA with SIC receivers, making it a\nviable option for future implementations."}
