Conventionally, the jammer transmits Gaussian noise (GN)\nto enhance security; however, the GN scheme also degrades the legitimate\nreceiver's performance. Encoded jamming (EJ) mitigates this interference but\ndoes not always outperform GN under varying channel conditions. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with EJ to maximize the secrecy rate.\nIn the multiple-input single-output (MISO) case, we adopt a semidefinite\nrelaxation (SDR)-based alternating optimization method, while in the\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) case, we develop an alternating\noptimization algorithm based on the weighted sum mean-square-error minimization\n(WMMSE) scheme. Furthermore, we are the first to incorporate EJ into an\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, characterizing the Pareto\nboundary between secrecy rate and sensing mutual information (MI) by solving\nthe resulting joint optimization problem using a modified WMMSE-based\nalgorithm.
