This paper presents a novel\ntransceiver that achieves high receiver sensitivity and low computational\ncomplexity. At the transmitter, we replace the conventional direct sequence\nspread spectrum (DSSS) preamble with a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) preamble,\nconsisting of a pair of down-chirp and up-chirp signals that are conjugate to\neach other, simplifying packet synchronization. For enhanced coverage, the\npayload incorporates continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) to\nmaintain a constant envelope and phase continuity, in conjunction with DSSS to\nachieve a high spreading gain. At the receiver, we develop a double-peak\ndetection method to improve synchronization and a non-coherent joint\ndespreading and demodulation scheme that increases receiver sensitivity while\nmaintaining simplicity in implementation. Furthermore, we optimize the preamble\ndetection threshold and spreading sequences for maximum non-coherent receiver\nperformance. The software-defined radio (SDR) prototype, developed using GNU\nRadio and USRP, along with operational snapshots, showcases its practical\nengineering applications. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and field-test\ntrials demonstrate that our transceiver outperforms traditional ones in terms\nof receiver sensitivity, while also being low in complexity and cost-effective\nfor LPWAN requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bLPWAN\u6536\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CSS\u524d\u5bfc\u548cCPFSK\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u63a5\u6536\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLPWAN\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528CSS\u524d\u5bfc\u7b80\u5316\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CPFSK\u548cDSSS\u63d0\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6269\u9891\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5cf0\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u89e3\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u578b\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u4e3aLPWAN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to\nsimultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and\ncounteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive\nsingle-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as\nwell as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's\nlocation. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays\nthe role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers\nchannels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly\ndistributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the\nergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for\ntarget localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper.

This paper proposes an\nenvironmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the\ngenerative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location\nembedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS\nlocation information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the\ncross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to\nrespectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as\nthat among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target\nBSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM\ninference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.\nSpecifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free\nnetworks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM\nconstruction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N\nmodel is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any\npotential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by\nexploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same\nwireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to\nmulti-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same\nwireless environment from different BS locations.

This is achieved through the\ninterconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave\nreconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at\none port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local\ncontrol of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further\nenhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,\nchannel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among\nnon-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of\nNR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices\ncommunicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure\ntransmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses\nsignal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a\nphysics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural\nscattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,\nthe advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate\nan all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization\nalgorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual\ndecomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS\nconsistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal\n(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two\nimpinging and reflection directions need to be supported.

To address this\nlimitation, in this paper, we propose two types of multiple-parameter GFRFTs\n(MPGFRFTs) and establish their corresponding theoretical frameworks. We design\na spectral compression strategy tailored for ultra-low compression ratios,\neffectively preserving essential information even under extreme dimensionality\nreduction. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a learnable order vector scheme\nthat enables adaptive compression and denoising, demonstrating strong\nperformance on both graph signals and images. We explore the application of\nMPGFRFTs to image encryption and decryption. Experimental results validate the\nversatility and superior performance of the proposed MPGFRFT framework across\nvarious graph signal processing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u56fe\u5206\u6570\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff08MPGFRFT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9636\u6570\u5411\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u89e3\u5bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u5206\u6570\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff08GFRFT\uff09\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u9891\u7387\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u9636\u6570\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdMPGFRFT\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8c31\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9636\u6570\u5411\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MPGFRFT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MPGFRFT\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u52a0\u5bc6\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
