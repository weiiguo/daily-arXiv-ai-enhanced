Movable antennas (MAs) and reconfigurable antennas (RAs)\nenable dynamic control over antenna's position, orientation, radiation,\npolarization, and frequency response, introducing rich electromagnetic-domain\ndegrees of freedom for the design and performance enhancement of wireless\nsystems. This article overviews their application scenarios, hardware\narchitectures, and design methods. Field test and simulation results highlight\ntheir performance benefits over conventional fixed/non-reconfigurable antennas."}
