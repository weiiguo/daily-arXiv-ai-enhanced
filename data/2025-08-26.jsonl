Our core idea lies in\nthe fact that the vector nature of an electromagnetic wave is uniquely\ndetermined by its orthogonal electric and magnetic field components, both of\nwhich can be retrieved by a single Rydberg atomic receiver via\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based spectroscopy. To be\nspecific, in the presence of a static magnetic bias field that defines a stable\nquantization axis, a pair of sequential EIT measurements is carried out in the\nsame vapor cell. Firstly, the electric-field polarization angle is extracted\nfrom the Zeeman-resolved EIT spectrum associated with an electric-dipole\ntransition driven by the radio frequency (RF) field. Within the same\nexperimental cycle, the RF field is then retuned to a magnetic-dipole\nresonance, producing Zeeman-resolved EIT peaks for decoding the RF\nmagnetic-field orientation.

However, their rapid proliferation has\noutpaced the development of standardized evaluation benchmarks, which\ncomplicates direct model comparisons and hinders systematic scientific\nprogress. This fragmentation fosters scientific inefficiency and obscures\ngenuine architectural advancements. To address this critical gap, we introduce\nEEG-FM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for the systematic and\nstandardized evaluation of EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs). Our contributions\nare threefold: (1) we curate a diverse suite of downstream tasks and datasets\nfrom canonical EEG paradigms, implementing standardized processing and\nevaluation protocols within a unified open-source framework; (2) we benchmark\nprominent state-of-the-art foundation models to establish comprehensive\nbaseline results for a clear comparison of the current landscape; (3) we\nperform qualitative analyses of the learned representations to provide insights\ninto model behavior and inform future architectural design. Through extensive\nexperiments, we find that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction,\nmultitask unified training and neuropsychological priors would contribute to\nenhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. By offering a\nunified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, EEG-FM-Bench\nseeks to catalyze progress and guide the community toward the development of\nmore robust and generalizable EEG-FMs. Code is released at\nhttps://github.com/xw1216/EEG-FM-Bench."}

Given limited energy resources, WSNs must operate efficiently to\nensure long-term performance. Their deployment, however, is challenged by\ndynamic environments where EH conditions, network scale, and traffic rates\nchange over time. In this work, we address system dynamics that yield different\nlearning tasks, where decision variables remain fixed but strategies vary, as\nwell as learning domains, where both decision space and strategies evolve. To\nhandle such scenarios, we propose a cross-domain lifelong reinforcement\nlearning (CD-L2RL) framework for energy-efficient WSN design. Our CD-L2RL\nalgorithm leverages prior experience to accelerate adaptation across tasks and\ndomains. Unlike conventional approaches based on Markov decision processes or\nLyapunov optimization, which assume relatively stable environments, our\nsolution achieves rapid policy adaptation by reusing knowledge from past tasks\nand domains to ensure continuous operations. We validate the approach through\nextensive simulations under diverse conditions. Results show that our method\nimproves adaptation speed by up to 35% over standard reinforcement learning and\nup to 70% over Lyapunov-based optimization, while also increasing total\nharvested energy. These findings highlight the strong potential of CD-L2RL for\ndeployment in dynamic 6G WSNs."}

For production\nenvironments, angle-resolved scatterometry offers a non- invasive and in-line\ncompatible alternative to traditional surface inspection methods, such as\nscanning electron microscopy. However, angle-resolved scatterometry currently\nsuffers from long data acquisition time. Our study addresses the issue of slow\ndata acquisition by proposing a compressed learning framework for the accurate\nrecognition of nanosurface deficiencies using angle-resolved scatterometry\ndata. The framework uses the particle swarm optimization algorithm with a\nsampling scheme customized for scattering patterns. This combination allows the\nidentification of optimal sampling points in scatterometry data that maximize\nthe detection accuracy of five different levels of deficiency in ZnO\nnanosurfaces. The proposed method significantly reduces the amount of sampled\ndata while maintaining a high accuracy in deficiency detection, even in noisy\nenvironments. Notably, by sampling only 1% of the data, the method achieves an\naccuracy of over 86%, which further improves to 94% when the sampling rate is\nincreased to 6%. These results demonstrate a favorable balance between data\nreduction and classification performance. The obtained results also show that\nthe compressed learning framework effectively identifies critical sampling\nareas."}

However, chirprate estimation via these approaches remains\nless accurate than IF estimation, primarily due to the slow decay of the\nchirplet transform or WCT along the chirprate direction. To address this, the\nsynchrosqueezed chirplet transform (SCT) and multiple SCT methods were\nproposed, achieving moderate improvements in IF and chirprate estimation\naccuracy. Nevertheless, a novel approach is still needed to enhance the\ntransform's decay along the chirprate direction.\n  This paper introduces an X-ray transform-based wavelet-chirprate transform,\ntermed the X-ray wavelet-chirplet transform (XWCT), which exhibits superior\ndecay along the chirprate direction compared to the WCT. Furthermore,\nthird-order synchrosqueezed variants of the WCT and XWCT are developed to yield\nsharp time-frequency-chirprate representations of signals. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the XWCT achieves significantly faster decay along the\nchirprate axis, while the third-order synchrosqueezed XWCT enables accurate IF\nand chirprate estimation, as well as mode retrieval, without requiring multiple\nsynchrosqueezing operations."}

Experimental results demonstrate strong generalization to varying\nuser counts, modulation schemes, and pilot configurations, while satisfying\nlatency constraints imposed by practical systems. The architecture is evaluated\nacross three core use cases: (1) an End-to-End Receiver, which replaces the\nentire baseband processing pipeline from pilot symbols to bit-level decisions;\n(2) Channel Frequency Interpolation, implemented and tested within a\n3GPP-compliant OAI+Aerial system; and (3) Channel Estimation, where the model\ninfers full-band channel responses from sparse pilot observations.
