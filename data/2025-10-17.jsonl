They offer\nunprecedented flexibility and spatial reconfigurability by enabling dynamic\npositioning and activation of radiating elements along a signal-guiding medium\n(e.g., dielectric waveguides), which is not possible with conventional fixed\nantenna systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of generalized\npinching antenna systems, which retain the core principle of creating localized\nradiation points on demand, but can be physically realized in a variety of\nsettings. These include implementations based on dielectric waveguides, leaky\ncoaxial cables, surface-wave guiding structures, and other types of media,\nemploying different feeding methods and activation mechanisms (e.g.,\nmechanical, electronic, or hybrid). Despite differences in their physical\nrealizations, they all share the same inherent ability to form, reposition, or\ndeactivate radiation sites as needed, enabling user-centric and dynamic\ncoverage. We first describe the underlying physical mechanisms of\nrepresentative generalized pinching-antenna realizations and their associated\nwireless channel models, highlighting their unique propagation and\nreconfigurability characteristics compared with conventional antennas. Then, we\nreview several representative pinching-antenna system architectures, ranging\nfrom single- to multiple-waveguide configurations, and discuss advanced design\nstrategies tailored to these flexible deployments.

To address this issue, we\nintroduce a new axiomatic framework, termed System Information Decomposition\n(SID), specifically tailored for three-variable systems. SID resolves the WESP\nviolation by redefining the summation rules of decomposed information atoms\nbased on synergistic relationships. However, we further show that for systems\nwith four or more variables, no partial summation approach within the existing\nlattice-based structures can fully eliminate WESP inconsistencies. Our results\nthus highlight the inherent inadequacy of (antichain) lattice-based\ndecompositions for general multivariate systems."}

They offer\nunprecedented flexibility and spatial reconfigurability by enabling dynamic\npositioning and activation of radiating elements along a signal-guiding medium\n(e.g., dielectric waveguides), which is not possible with conventional fixed\nantenna systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of generalized\npinching antenna systems, which retain the core principle of creating localized\nradiation points on demand, but can be physically realized in a variety of\nsettings. These include implementations based on dielectric waveguides, leaky\ncoaxial cables, surface-wave guiding structures, and other types of media,\nemploying different feeding methods and activation mechanisms (e.g.,\nmechanical, electronic, or hybrid). Despite differences in their physical\nrealizations, they all share the same inherent ability to form, reposition, or\ndeactivate radiation sites as needed, enabling user-centric and dynamic\ncoverage. We first describe the underlying physical mechanisms of\nrepresentative generalized pinching-antenna realizations and their associated\nwireless channel models, highlighting their unique propagation and\nreconfigurability characteristics compared with conventional antennas. Then, we\nreview several representative pinching-antenna system architectures, ranging\nfrom single- to multiple-waveguide configurations, and discuss advanced design\nstrategies tailored to these flexible deployments. Furthermore, we examine\ntheir integration with emerging wireless technologies to enable synergistic,\nuser-centric solutions. Finally, we identify key open research challenges and\noutline future directions, charting a pathway toward the practical deployment\nof generalized pinching antennas in next-generation wireless networks."}

Specifically, we consider a cell-free network comprising a large\nnumber of users, multiple targets, and distributed base stations (BSs). In each\ntime slot, a random subset of users becomes active, transmitting pilot signals\nthat can be scattered by the targets before reaching the BSs. Unlike\nconventional massive random access schemes, where the primary objectives are\ndevice activity detection and channel estimation, our framework also enables\ntarget localization by leveraging the multipath propagation effects introduced\nby the targets. However, due to the intricate dependency between user channels\nand target locations, characterizing the posterior distribution required for\nminimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation presents significant computational\nchallenges. To handle this problem, we propose a hybrid message passing-based\nframework that incorporates multiple approximations to mitigate computational\ncomplexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves\nhigh-accuracy device activity detection, channel estimation, and target\nlocalization simultaneously, validating the feasibility of embedding\nlocalization functionality into massive communication systems for future 6G\nnetworks."}
