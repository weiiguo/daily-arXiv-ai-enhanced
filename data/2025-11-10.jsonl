This research is motivated by\ntwo critical challenges: limited coverage provided by mmWave frequencies and\nhigh infrastructure costs associated with current technologies. IRSs can help\neliminate these issues because they can reflect electromagnetic waves to\nenhance signal propagation, thereby reducing blockages and extending network\ncoverage. However, deploying a separate IRS for each mobile network operator\n(MNO) can result in inefficiencies, redundant infrastructure, potential\nconflicts over placement, and interoperator interference. To address these\nchallenges, in this study, an IRS sharing system is proposed in which multiple\nMNOs collaborate to use a common IRS infrastructure. This approach not only\nenhances network flexibility and reduces costs but also minimizes the effect of\ninteroperator interference. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that IRS\nsharing effectively balances performance and fairness among MNOs, outperforming\nMNO-specific deployment methods in multi-MNO scenarios. This study provides\ninsights into the potential of IRS sharing to support sustainable 6G networks,\nthereby contributing to the efficient deployment and operation of\nnext-generation wireless communication systems."}
