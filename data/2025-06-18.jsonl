At high speeds and in cluttered environments, Doppler shifts and rapid multipath changes can dramatically raise packet error rates. This paper investigates these phenomena in the context of ExpressLRS (ELRS) long-range FPV control links and demonstrates a novel solution: real-time geometry tuning of a circularly polarized helical antenna array. This study integrates Maxwell-equation-based full-wave simulations (via Ansys HFSS) with controlled, blind field trials to validate performance. A new analysis framework incorporates Doppler-induced frequency offset into the antenna's radiation pattern and the system's error model. Compared to a conventional fixed antenna, the adaptive helical array shows a 20-30% PER reduction when drones exceed 150 mph. The adaptive system automatically adjusts coil pitch and diameter to retune the antenna as flight parameters (velocity, attitude) change. Measured VSWR stays near unity, preventing transmitter reflection spikes. RSSI variation is reduced by half, indicating stronger link stability in urban multi-path. A regression analysis confirms that the reduction in PER due to tuning is highly statistically significant. Calibration data and error analyses are provided to validate our methodology. These findings advance the understanding of high-mobility UAV communication channels and demonstrate that reconfigurable hardware-here, mechanically tunable helices-can effectively counter Doppler and multi-path impairments. The findings inform new design principles for UAV antenna arrays and suggest a path toward AI-integrated adaptive RF systems for drone swarms and racing platforms."}

Given that acoustic waves represent an effective medium for long-distance transmission in aquatic environments, underwater acoustic target tracking has become a prominent research area of underwater communications and networking. Existing literature reviews often offer a narrow perspective or inadequately address the paradigm shifts driven by emerging technologies like deep learning and reinforcement learning. To address these gaps, this work presents a systematic survey of this field and introduces an innovative multidimensional taxonomy framework based on target scale, sensor perception modes, and sensor collaboration patterns. Within this framework, we comprehensively survey the literature (more than 180 publications) over the period 2016-2025, spanning from the theoretical foundations to diverse algorithmic approaches in underwater acoustic target tracking. Particularly, we emphasize the transformative potential and recent advancements of machine learning techniques, including deep learning and reinforcement learning, in enhancing the performance and adaptability of underwater tracking systems. Finally, this survey concludes by identifying key challenges in the field and proposing future avenues based on emerging technologies such as federated learning, blockchain, embodied intelligence, and large models."}

However, in practice, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper considers a hybrid near-far field activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO, and establishes a covariance-based formulation, which facilitates the development of a distributed algorithm to alleviate the computational burden at the central processing unit (CPU). Specifically, each AP performs local activity detection for the devices and then transmits the detection result to the CPU for further processing. In particular, a novel coordinate descent algorithm based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury update with Taylor expansion is proposed to handle the local detection problem at each AP. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how the hybrid near-far field channels affect the detection performance. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing approaches."}

Unlike traditional MIMO, FAS involves joint port selection and precoder design, a combinatorial NP-hard optimization problem. Moreover, fully leveraging FAS requires acquiring Channel State Information (CSI) across its ports, a challenge exacerbated by the system's near-continuous reconfigurability. These factors make traditional system design methods impractical for FAS due to nonconvexity and prohibitive computational complexity. While deep learning (DL)-based approaches have been proposed for MIMO optimization, their limited generalization and fitting capabilities render them suboptimal for FAS. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) extend DL's capabilities by offering general-purpose adaptability, reasoning, and few-shot learning, thereby overcoming the limitations of task-specific, data-intensive models. This article presents a vision for LLM-driven FAS design, proposing a novel flexible communication framework. To demonstrate the potential, we examine LLM-enhanced FAS in multiuser scenarios, showcasing how LLMs can revolutionize FAS optimization."}

However, the dynamic nature of satellite channels and their inherent impairments present significant challenges. In this paper, a novel post-compensation scheme that combines the complex-valued extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (CELMAH) architecture and widely linear processing (WLP) is developed to address these issues by exploiting signal impropriety in satellite communications. Although CELMAH shares structural similarities with WLP, it employs a different core algorithm and does not fully exploit the signal impropriety. By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution."}

This paper combines MC with identification and proposes a one-dimensional (1D) diffusion-based model. Diffusion noise is modeled as a Poisson process, and a lower bound on channel capacity is derived. Simulations, microscopic, and with short-length deterministic codes, validate theoretical results, including the channel impulse response and error bounds.

In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks."}
