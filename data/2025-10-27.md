### [1] [Information Theoretic Learning for Diffusion Models with Warm Start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20903)
*Yirong Shen,Lu Gan,Cong Ling*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种更紧的似然下界，用于改进基于噪声的生成模型的极大似然学习，提高了准确性和效率，在多个数据集上取得了竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扰动的似然估计模型虽然强大，但面临收敛慢和理论理解有限的问题，需要改进似然边界来提升学习效果。

Method: 将经典KL散度Fisher信息关系扩展到任意噪声扰动，超越高斯假设，允许使用结构化噪声分布，将扩散过程视为高斯通道来表达数据与模型之间的失配熵。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上取得竞争性负对数似然，在ImageNet多个分辨率上达到最先进结果，无需数据增强，且框架自然扩展到离散数据。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为噪声驱动模型提供了更紧的似然边界，提高了最大似然学习的准确性和效率，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Generative models that maximize model likelihood have gained traction in many
practical settings. Among them, perturbation based approaches underpin many
strong likelihood estimation models, yet they often face slow convergence and
limited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we derive a tighter
likelihood bound for noise driven models to improve both the accuracy and
efficiency of maximum likelihood learning. Our key insight extends the
classical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise
perturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured
noise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise
distributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization
effects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with
standard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian
channel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model,
showing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood
(NLL). In experiments, our models achieve competitive NLL on CIFAR-10 and SOTA
results on ImageNet across multiple resolutions, all without data augmentation,
and the framework extends naturally to discrete data.

### [2] [Overlapped-repetition Shor codes achieving fourfold asymptotic rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21030)
*En-Jui Chang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 通过重叠少量重复码，将Shor码的渐近码率提高四倍，在最小距离d=3时从[[9,1,3]]优化到[[7,1,3]]配置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Shor码使用两个重复码作为内外码，结构简单但码率相对较低，需要改进码率性能

Method: 通过重叠少量重复码来构建量子纠错码，优化码结构

Result: 渐近码率提高四倍，最小距离d=3时从[[9,1,3]]优化到[[7,1,3]]，减少了开销

Conclusion: 重叠重复码的方法能有效提高量子纠错码的码率，在保持纠错能力的同时减少物理量子比特需求

Abstract: The standard Shor code employs two repetition codes as inner and outer codes,
yielding a simple structure but a relatively low code rate. By overlapping a
small number of repetition codes, we enhance the asymptotic code rate fourfold.
In the minimal-distance case $d = 3$, this construction reduces the overhead
from $[[9,1,3]]$ to the more efficient $[[7,1,3]]$ configuration.

### [3] [Complex DNA Synthesis Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21253)
*Boaz Moav,Ryan Gabrys,Eitan Yaakobi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合DNA合成框架，结合了酶促合成和光刻合成的优点，在受限核苷酸子集中进行并行合成，建立了新的复杂合成序列概念和信息率分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA存储具有高密度和耐久性，但可扩展性受限于并行链合成的效率。现有方法要么允许无约束的核苷酸添加，要么强制所有链进行相同添加，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 引入混合合成框架，在每个周期从受限核苷酸子集中选择并并行合成；定义了复杂合成序列概念；扩展了信息率定义；设计了动态规划算法计算最优合成序列。

Result: 推导了最大信息率及其渐近行为的紧致表达式；建立了约束模型与理想化设置之间的理论桥梁；为已知链设计了最优合成序列算法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个全面统一的DNA合成理论框架，涵盖了先前的模型，为该领域的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: DNA-based storage offers unprecedented density and durability, but its
scalability is fundamentally limited by the efficiency of parallel strand
synthesis. Existing methods either allow unconstrained nucleotide additions to
individual strands, such as enzymatic synthesis, or enforce identical additions
across many strands, such as photolithographic synthesis. We introduce and
analyze a hybrid synthesis framework that generalizes both approaches: in each
cycle, a nucleotide is selected from a restricted subset and incorporated in
parallel. This model gives rise to a new notion of a complex synthesis
sequence. Building on this framework, we extend the information rate definition
of Lenz et al. and analyze an analog of the deletion ball, defined and studied
in this setting, deriving tight expressions for the maximal information rate
and its asymptotic behavior. These results bridge the theoretical gap between
constrained models and the idealized setting in which every nucleotide is
always available. For the case of known strands, we design a dynamic
programming algorithm that computes an optimal complex synthesis sequence,
highlighting structural similarities to the shortest common supersequence
problem. We also define a distinct two-dimensional array model with synthesis
constraints over the rows, which extends previous synthesis models in the
literature and captures new structural limitations in large-scale strand
arrays. Additionally, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm for this
problem as well. Our results establish a new and comprehensive theoretical
framework for constrained DNA, subsuming prior models and setting the stage for
future advances in the field.

### [4] [Text-Guided Diffusion Model-based Generative Communication for Wireless Image Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21299)
*Shengkang Chen,Tong Wu,Zhiyong Chen,Feng Yang,Meixia Tao,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散模型的生成式通信框架，在极低传输速率下通过JSCC和语义引导重建实现可靠图像传输


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极低传输速率下传统压缩和信道编码无法保持足够视觉质量的问题

Method: 结合JSCC与预训练生成模型，发送端编码图像并传输文本提示，接收端通过Stable Diffusion和ControlNet融合语义信息重建图像

Result: 在极端带宽限制下仍能产生感知可信的图像，在各种信道条件下均优于传统编码方案和深度学习基线

Conclusion: 该生成式通信框架在极低速率下实现了优越的感知质量和鲁棒性

Abstract: Reliable image transmission over wireless channels is particularly
challenging at extremely low transmission rates, where conventional compression
and channel coding schemes fail to preserve adequate visual quality. To address
this issue, we propose a generative communication framework based on diffusion
models, which integrates joint source channel coding (JSCC) with
semantic-guided reconstruction leveraging a pre-trained generative model.
Unlike conventional architectures that aim to recover exact pixel values of the
original image, the proposed method focuses on preserving and reconstructing
semantically meaningful visual content under severely constrained rates,
ensuring perceptual plausibility and faithfulness to the scene intent.
Specifically, the transmitter encodes the source image via JSCC and jointly
transmits it with a textual prompt over the wireless channel. At the receiver,
the corrupted low-rate representation is fused with the prompt and
reconstructed through a Stable Diffusion model with ControlNet, enabling
high-quality visual recovery. Leveraging both generative priors and semantic
guidance, the proposed framework produces perceptually convincing images even
under extreme bandwidth limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method consistently outperforms conventional coding-based schemes and
deep learning baselines, achieving superior perceptual quality and robustness
across various channel conditions.

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型能够学习无线信道的复杂先验分布，为传统信道估计提供了强大替代方案。

Method: 设计轻量级潜在扩散模型架构作为生成先验，增强扩散后验采样过程，引入似然项有效近似和变分自编码器潜在空间的定制自一致性约束。

Result: PSLD-CE在广泛实验中始终优于现有方法，获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持低计算复杂度和快速推理速度的同时，为下一代无线系统提供了高度有前景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep generative models offer a powerful alternative to conventional channel
estimation by learning the complex prior distribution of wireless channels.
Capitalizing on this potential, this paper proposes a novel channel estimation
algorithm based on latent diffusion models (LDMs), termed posterior sampling
with latent diffusion for channel estimation (PSLD-CE). The core of our
approach is a lightweight LDM architecture specifically designed for channel
estimation, which serves as a powerful generative prior to capture the
intricate channel distribution. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion posterior
sampling process by introducing an effective approximation for the likelihood
term and a tailored self-consistency constraint on the variational autoencoder
latent space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PSLD-CE
consistently outperforms a wide range of existing methods. Notably, these
significant performance gains are achieved while maintaining low computational
complexity and fast inference speed, establishing our method as a highly
promising and practical solution for next-generation wireless systems.

### [6] [Universal Maximum Likelihood (List) Decoding via Fast Vector-Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21414)
*Hoang Ly,Emina Soljanin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的最大似然解码框架，将最坏情况时间复杂度从q^k n降低到q^k，代价是较高的空间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最大似然解码的最坏情况时间复杂度与穷举搜索相当，需要q^k n次操作，这在实践中计算成本过高。

Method: 通过将码字的条件概率表示为两个向量的内积，将似然度评估转化为单次向量-矩阵乘法，并使用Mailman算法降低计算成本。

Result: 将最坏情况时间复杂度降低了n倍，降至q^k次操作，适用于线性和非线性分组码、硬判决和软判决解码。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了显著的时间复杂度降低，但需要O(q^{k+1} n)的空间复杂度来存储预计算的码本矩阵。

Abstract: Maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding for arbitrary block codes remains
fundamentally hard, with worst-case time complexity-measured by the total
number of multiplications-being no better than straightforward exhaustive
search, which requires $q^{k} n$ operations for an $[n,k]_q$ code. This paper
introduces a simple, code-agnostic framework that reduces the worst-case
complexity by a factor of $n$, down to $q^{k}$ operations, a highly desirable
reduction in practice. The result holds for both linear and nonlinear block
codes over general memoryless channels and under both hard-decision and
soft-decision decoding. It naturally extends to intersymbol-interference (ISI)
channels and ML list decoding with only a negligible increase in complexity.
Our core insight is that, upon receipt of each sequence at the receiver, the
conditional probability of that sequence for each codeword in the codebook
(i.e., the \emph{likelihood}) can be expressed as the inner product of two
carefully constructed vectors -- the first depending on the received sequence,
and the second on that codeword itself. As a result, evaluating the likelihoods
for all codewords in the codebook reduces to a single vector-matrix
multiplication, and ML decoding (MLD) becomes the simple task of picking the
maximum entry in the resulting vector. The only non-trivial cost lies in the
vector-matrix product. However, our matrix construction allows the use of the
Mailman algorithm to reduce this cost. This time reduction is achieved at the
cost of high space complexity, requiring $\mathcal{O}(q^{k+1} n)$ space to
store the pre-computed codebook matrix.

### [7] [Resilient Radio Access Networks: AI and the Unknown Unknowns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21587)
*Bho Matthiesen,Armin Dekorsy,Petar Popovski*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在5G网络中设计AI以实现网络弹性的挑战，特别关注未预料和罕见中断情况，指出当前统计学习方法的局限性，并建议结合在线学习和因果推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络虽然具有高可靠性和可用性，但在面对意外情况时仍可能失效。弹性系统能够适应现实世界的复杂性，包括系统设计时完全未预料到的运行条件。这使得弹性成为通信系统在缺乏模型或模型过于复杂无法提供统计保证的场景中维持服务的关键属性。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究为弹性无线接入网络设计AI的挑战，特别关注未预料和罕见中断。分析当前统计学习方法在弹性方面的局限性。

Result: 理论结果表明当前统计学习方法在实现网络弹性方面存在严重局限性。

Conclusion: AI将在提供网络弹性方面发挥重要作用，但需要超越传统统计学习方法，结合在线学习和因果推断等方法来应对未预料和罕见中断的挑战。

Abstract: 5G networks offer exceptional reliability and availability, ensuring
consistent performance and user satisfaction. Yet they might still fail when
confronted with the unexpected. A resilient system is able to adapt to
real-world complexity, including operating conditions completely unanticipated
during system design. This makes resilience a vital attribute for communication
systems that must sustain service in scenarios where models are absent or too
intricate to provide statistical guarantees. Such considerations indicate that
artifical intelligence (AI) will play a major role in delivering resilience. In
this paper, we examine the challenges of designing AIs for resilient radio
access networks, especially with respect to unanticipated and rare disruptions.
Our theoretical results indicate strong limitations of current statistical
learning methods for resilience and suggest connections to online learning and
causal inference.

### [8] [A Multiscale Approach for Enhancing Weak Signal Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20828)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阈值检测系统，结合随机共振和多尺度分析来增强弱信号检测，相比传统单阈值方法性能显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机共振技术基于单阈值检测器，局限于时间无关信号，且需要大量噪声，可能扭曲复杂信号特征

Method: 使用双阈值检测系统，在原始数据域和多尺度域（小波变换）进行集成评估，并与现有方法比较

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入稳健的弱信号识别方法推进了基于随机共振的检测技术，在多个学科具有应用潜力

Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate
modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within
non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold
detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often
large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort
complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study
explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale
applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be
analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying
dynamics.
  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two
single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it
both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated
and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.
  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the
proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection
compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is
further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while
outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based
detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal
identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.

### [9] [Is Repeater-Assisted Massive MIMO Compatible with Dynamic TDD?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20998)
*Martin Andersson,Anubhab Chowdhury,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一个在动态时分双工中继辅助大规模MIMO网络中联合优化中继器增益放大和相移的框架，通过算法校准增益以放大期望信号并限制干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中继器作为具有放大和相移功能的有源散射体，能增强用户接收信号强度，但在动态TDD系统中也会放大噪声和干扰信号，特别是由于上下行并发传输引入的跨链路干扰，需要在期望信号和干扰信号放大之间进行权衡。

Method: 首先推导下行和上行频谱效率，然后开发用于频谱效率最大化的中继器增益优化算法。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的算法成功校准了中继器增益，能够放大期望信号同时限制干扰。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决动态TDD中继网络中期望信号与干扰信号放大的权衡问题，通过优化中继器增益提升系统性能。

Abstract: We present a framework for joint amplification and phase shift optimization
of the repeater gain in dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) repeater-assisted
massive MIMO networks. Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification
and phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they
inevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become
particularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink
(DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among
access points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes
a non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals.
To underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve
performance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then
develop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization.
Numerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the
repeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference.

*Zhonglun Wang,Yizhe Zhao,Gangming Hu,Yali Zheng,Kun Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种6D可移动全息表面(6DMHS)集成数据与能量传输系统，通过三阶段协议协调6DMHS，有效服务IDET接收器，提升了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可重构全息表面(RHS)虽然能实现低成本大规模阵列，但其幅度控制的全息波束成形存在方向波动问题，难以充分利用RHS的空间增益。6D可移动天线(6DMA)为解决这一问题提供了潜在方案。

Method: 提出三阶段协议：上行链路感知阶段、方向调整阶段和下行链路传输阶段。首先利用全息感知技术获取接收器信息；然后固定旋转参数，优化6DMHS的方向和RHS的全息波束成形；最后固定6DMHS方向和全息波束成形，优化数字波束成形、功率分配因子和能量收集功率。

Conclusion: 6DMHS集成系统通过协调空间定位和波束成形，有效解决了RHS的方向波动问题，为集成数据与能量传输系统提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) enables cost-effective large-scale
arrays with high spatial gain. However, its amplitude-controlled holographic
beamforming suffers from directional fluctuations, making it difficult to fully
exploit the spatial gain of RHS. Fortunately, the promising 6D movable antenna
(6DMA) provides a potential solution to this problem. In this paper, we study a
6D movable holographic surface (6DMHS) integrated data and energy transfer
(IDET) system, where a three-stage protocol is proposed, consisting of an
uplink sensing stage, an orientation adjustment stage and a downlink
transmission stage, to coordinate the 6DMHS and effectively serve the IDET
receivers. Firstly, the holographic-based sensing technology is proposed and
the sensing information of the IDET receivers is exploited. Secondly, by fixing
the rotations with the sensing information, the orientation optimization
problem is formulated for designing the holographic beamforming of the RHS and
adjusting the translations of the 6DMHS. As a result, the directions with
maximum beamforming gain are aligned with each IDET receiver. Thirdly, by
fixing the orientation of the 6DMHS and the holographic beamforming, the
equivalent wireless channel is obtained. The IDET performance optimization
problem is formulated for obtaining the optimal digital beamforming, power
splitting factor and energy harvesting (EH) power. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of improving the IDET
performance compared to the benchmarks.

Abstract: Collective perception is a key aspect for autonomous driving in smart cities
as it aims to combine the local environment models of multiple intelligent
vehicles in order to overcome sensor limitations. A crucial part of
multi-sensor fusion is track-to-track association. Previous works often suffer
from high computational complexity or are based on heuristics. We propose an
association algorithms based on stochastic optimization, which leverages a
multidimensional likelihood incorporating the number of tracks and their
spatial distribution and furthermore computes several association hypotheses.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in Monte Carlo simulations and
a realistic collective perception scenario computing high-likelihood
associations in ambiguous settings.

Abstract: This work investigates an integrated sensing and edge artificial intelligence
(ISEA) system, where multiple devices first transmit probing signals for target
sensing and then offload locally extracted features to the access point (AP)
via analog over-the-air computation (AirComp) for collaborative inference. To
characterize the relationship between AirComp error and inference performance,
two proxies are established: the \emph{computation-optimal} proxy that
minimizes the aggregation distortion, and the \emph{decision-optimal} proxy
that maximizes the inter-class separability, respectively. Optimal transceiver
designs in terms of closed-form power allocation are derived for both
time-division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)
settings, revealing threshold-based and dual-decomposition structures,
respectively. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings.
