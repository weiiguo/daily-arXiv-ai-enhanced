Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced. These results suggest that reconstructing what the brain perceives, rather than what it classifies, is key to faithful EEG-based image generation."}

To address these challenges, the propagation environment semantics-aware wireless environment knowledge beam prediction (PES-WEKBP) framework is proposed. PES-WEKBP pioneers a novel electromagnetic (EM)-grounded knowledge distillation method, transforming raw visual data into an ultra-lean, interpretable material and location-related wireless environment knowledge matrix. This matrix explicitly encodes critical propagation environment semantics, which is material EM properties and spatial relationships through a physics-informed parameterization process, distilling the environment and channel interplay into a minimal yet information-dense representation. A lightweight decision network then leverages this highly compressed knowledge for low-complexity beam prediction. To holistically evaluate the performance of PES-WEKBP, we first design the prediction consistency-efficiency index (PCEI), which combines prediction accuracy with a stability-penalized logarithmic training time to ensure a balanced optimization of reliability and computational efficiency. Experiments validate that PES-WEKBP achieves a 99.75% to 99.96% dimension reduction and improves accuracy by 5.52% to 8.19%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PCEI scores across diverse vehicular scenarios."}

Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries."}

Signal Process", "summary": "Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is well-suited for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), yet its cyclic prefix (CP) is dimensioned for communications-grade multipath and is generally insufficient for sensing. When echoes exceed the CP duration, inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISI/ICI) break subcarrier orthogonality and degrade sensing. This paper presents a unified analytical and algorithmic framework for OFDM-ISAC beyond the CP limit. We first develop a general echo model that explicitly captures the structured coupling of ISI and ICI caused by CP insufficiency. Building on this model, we derive closed-form expressions for the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the range-Doppler peak sidelobe level ratio (PSLR), both of which are shown to deteriorate approximately linearly with the normalized excess delay beyond the CP. To mitigate these effects, we propose two standard-compatible successive interference cancellation (SIC) methods: SIC-DFT, a low-complexity DFT-based scheme, and SIC-ESPRIT, a super-resolution subspace approach. Simulations corroborate the analysis and demonstrate consistent gains over representative benchmarks. Both algorithms provide more than $4$dB SINR improvement under CP-insufficient conditions, while SIC-ESPRIT reduces range/velocity root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) by about one order of magnitude, approaching the performance achievable with a sufficiently long CP. These results offer both theoretical insight and practical solutions for reliable long-range OFDM-ISAC sensing beyond the CP limit."}

A repeater is an active scatterer that retransmits incoming signals with a complex gain almost instantaneously, thereby enhancing sensing performance by amplifying the echoes reflected by the targets. The same mechanism can also improve downlink communication by mitigating coverage holes. However, the repeater introduces noise and increases interference at the sensing receiver, while also amplifying the interference from target detection signals at the downlink users. The proposed framework accounts for these sensing-communication trade-offs and demonstrates the potential benefits achievable through a carefully designed precoder at the transmitting base station. In particular, our finding is that a higher value of probability of detection can be attained with considerably lower target radar-cross-section variance by deploying repeaters in the target hot-spot areas."}

Our key idea lies in spreading data symbols across the delay-Doppler (DD) domain through orthogonal chirp-Zak transform (CZT). To enable efficient signal multiplexing, the proposed modulation scheme employs a transmitter signal that maintains orthogonality with the inherent resolution characteristics of the DD plane. Termed as Orthogonal Chirp Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (CDDM), we demonstrate a synergistic integration of chirp waveform properties with the channel structure of the DD domain, thereby achieving advantages with both lower computational efficiency and improved detection performance. We introduce a novel CZT-based superimposed sparse pilot structure to enable simultaneous estimation of delay-Doppler shifts and channel coefficients. For enhanced performance, we further develop an embedded pilot scheme that demonstrates channel estimation performance comparable to that of Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ODDM) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that CDDM achieves significant bit error rate (BER) improvements over existing modulation schemes , under perfect channel state information (CSI), as well as superior out-of-band emissions (OOBE). Further, for the imperfect CSI case, the proposed CZT-based superimposed pilot scheme leads to significantly reduced normalized mean square error (NMSE), whilst attaining equivalent estimation accuracy to that of ODDM with lower computational complexity."}

The receiver aims to decode only user 1 message but may also decode user 2 message when beneficial. In the synchronous setting, the receiver employs two parallel sub-decoders: one dedicated to decoding user 1 message and another that jointly decodes both users messages. Their outputs are synthesized to produce the final decoding or collision decision. For the asynchronous setting, we examine a time interval containing $L$ consecutive codewords from each user. The receiver deploys $2^{2L}$ parallel sub-decoders, each responsible for decoding a subset of the message-code index pairs. In both synchronous and asynchronous cases, every sub-decoder partitions the coding space into three disjoint regions: operation, margin, and collision, and outputs either decoded messages or a collision report according to the region in which the estimated code index vector lies. Error events are defined for each sub-decoder and for the overall receiver whenever the expected output is not produced. We derive achievable upper bounds on the generalized error performance, defined as a weighted sum of incorrect-decoding, collision, and miss-detection probabilities, for both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios."}

The effectiveness of the developed three-stage strategy stems from the careful design of both the pilot signal sequence of the users and the vectors of RIS. Specifically, in Stage I, the cascaded channel components are eliminated by configuring the RIS phase shift vectors with a π difference to estimate the direct channels for all users. The orthogonal subspace projection is employed in Stage II to obtain equivalent signal matrices, enabling the estimation of angles of departure (AoDs) of the user-RIS channel for all users. In Stage III, we combine the signals of the time slots with the same pilots and project obtained measurement matrix to the orthogonal complement space of the component consisting of the portion of the direct channel, which removes the direct components and thus prevents error propagation from the direct channels to the cascaded channels. Then, we estimate the angles of arrival (AoAs) of the RIS-BS channel and remaining parameters of the cascaded channel for all users by exploiting the sparsity and correlation in the obtained equivalent matrices.

In addition, learnable historical sidelobe information is introduced to enhance the robustness and environmental adaptability of the detection process. Furthermore, based on multichannel echo data, a target reconstruction model that combines the Candan algorithm with least-squares estimation is established, incorporating the CLEAN concept to suppress sidelobe interference. Monte Carlo simulations and real-world measurement experiments demonstrate that the proposed CT-CFAR algorithm achieves high-precision target detection without requiring prior knowledge of abnormal samples.

On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI."}

Existing work typically focuses solely on protecting the function value and not the underlying data. In this work, we propose a general framework that offers protection for both the data and the function values. Since protecting the data inherently contributes to protecting the function value, we focus on scenarios where the function value requires stronger protection than the data itself. We first introduce a more general approach and a framework for function-correcting codes that incorporates data protection along with protection of function values. A two-step construction procedure for such codes is proposed, and bounds on the optimal redundancy of general FCCs with data protection are reported. Using these results, we exhibit examples that show that data protection can be added to existing FCCs without increasing redundancy. Using our two-step construction procedure, we present explicit constructions of FCCs with data protection for specific families of functions, such as locally bounded functions and the Hamming weight function. We associate a graph called minimum-distance graph to a code and use it to show that perfect codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes cannot provide additional protection to function values over and above the amount of protection for data for any function. Then we focus on linear FCCs and provide some results for linear functions, leveraging their inherent structural properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of FCCs with a linear structure. Finally, we generalize the Plotkin and Hamming bounds well known in classical error-correcting coding theory to FCCs with data protection."}

Semantic Communication (SemCom) emerges as a promising solution to enhance spectral efficiency by transmitting essential semantic information. This paper proposes a novel multi-cluster UAV-aided SAGIN SemCom architecture that supports both semantic users (SemUsers) and conventional users (ConUsers).

In addition, most existing CSI acquisition methods fail to leverage the spatio-temporal sparsity inherent in the channel, resulting in suboptimal estimation performance. To address these challenges, we consider an XL-IRS-aided wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose an efficient channel estimation and tracking (CET) algorithm. Specifically, a unified near-field cascaded channel representation model is presented first, and a hierarchical spatio-temporal sparse prior is then constructed to capture two-dimensional (2D) block sparsity in the polar domain, one-dimensional (1D) clustered sparsity in the angle-delay domain, and temporal correlations across different channel estimation frames. Based on these priors, a tensor-based sparse CET (TS-CET) algorithm is proposed that integrates tensor-based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with particle-based variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing.

We begin by characterizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multi-target angle of arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the antenna's positions in MA arrays, thereby establishing a theoretical foundation for antenna position optimization. Then, aiming at improving the sensing coverage performance, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the expectation of the trace of the CRB matrix over random target angles subject to a given distribution by optimizing the antennas' positions. To tackle the formulated challenging optimization problem, the Monte Carlo method is employed to approximate the intractable objective function, and a swarm-based gradient descent algorithm is subsequently proposed to address the approximated problem. In addition, a lower-bound on the sum of CRBs for multi-target AoA estimation is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-based design achieves superior sensing performance compared to conventional systems using fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays and single-target-oriented MA arrays, in terms of decreasing both CRB and the actual AoA estimation mean square error (MSE). Fundamentally, the designed MA array geometry exhibits low correlation and high effective power of sensitivity vectors for multi-target sensing in the angular domain, leading to significant CRB performance improvement.

While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This \"Energy-Time-Space\" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence."}

However, conventional MA implementations often adopt fully digital beamforming (FDB), which requires a dedicated RF chain for each antenna. This requirement significantly increase hardware costs, making such systems impractical for multi-antenna deployments. To address this, hardware-efficient analog beamforming (AB) offers a cost-effective alternative. This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) in an MA-enabled multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system with an emphasis on AB. In this scenario, an MA-enabled transmitter with AB broadcasts common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, while a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our objective is to maximize the multicast secrecy rate (MSR) by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the AB and the positions of the MAs, subject to constraints on the movement area of the MAs and the constant modulus (CM) property of the analog phase shifters. This MSR maximization problem is highly challenging, as we have formally proven it to be NP-hard. To solve it efficiently, we propose a penalty constrained product manifold (PCPM) framework. Specifically, we first reformulate the position constraints as a penalty function, enabling unconstrained optimization on a product manifold space (PMS), and then propose a parallel conjugate gradient descent algorithm to efficiently update the variables. Simulation results demonstrate that MA-enabled systems with AB can achieve a well-balanced performance in terms of MSR and hardware costs."}

Our core methodology reconfigures the fundamental polarization process by stitching additional structures to enhance the reliability of less reliable information bits in the original code. This approach preserves the polar transformation structure and maintains the same encoding and decoding complexity. Thanks to the flexible configuration, stitched polar codes consistently outperform regular polar codes, effectively solving the performance degradation issue in rate-matched scenarios. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis on the weight spectrum and the polarization speed of stitched polar codes to prove their superiority."}

To enhance service reliability in remote areas, this paper proposes a hybrid satellite architecture for task offloading that combines Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and LEO satellites. We develop an optimization framework to maximize task offloading admission rate while balancing the energy consumption and delay requirements. Accounting for satellite visibility and limited computing resources, our approach integrates dynamic path selection with frequency and computational resource allocation. Because the formulated problem is NP-hard, we reformulate it into a mixed-integer convex form using disjunctive constraints and convex relaxation techniques, enabling efficient use of off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Simulation results show that, compared to a standalone LEO network, the proposed hybrid LEO-MEO architecture improves the task admission rate by 15\\% and reduces the average delay by 12\\%. These findings highlight the architecture's potential to enhance connectivity and user experience in remote Arctic areas."}

Unlike learning-based JSCC methods that implicitly absorb channel variations, Robust-NTC explicitly models element-wise latent distributions via a variational objective with a Gaussian proxy for quantization and channel noise, allowing encoder-decoder to capture latent uncertainty without channel-specific training. Using the learned statistics, Robust-NTC also facilitates rate-distortion optimization to adaptively select element-wise quantizers and bit depths according to online channel condition. To support practical deployment, Robust-NTC is integrated into an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a unified resource allocation framework jointly optimizes latent quantization, bit allocation, modulation order, and power allocation to minimize transmission latency while guaranteeing learned distortion targets. Simulation results demonstrate that for practical OFDM systems, Robust-NTC achieves superior rate-distortion efficiency and stable reconstruction fidelity compared to digital JSCC baselines across wide-ranging SNR conditions."}

On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI."}

In this paper, we propose a novel dual-RIS-assisted architecture for smart indoor wireless signal routing, wherein the second RIS (RIS$_2$) is dynamically configured based on source data bits to steer signals toward specific receivers or indoor zones. The first RIS (RIS$_1$), positioned near a fed antenna or access point, passively reflects the incident signal. RIS$_2$, equipped with a lightweight controller, performs bit-driven spatial modulation to enable data-dependent direction selection at the physical layer. We develop a complete end-to-end system model, including multi-hop channel representation, RIS phase configuration mapping, and signal detection based on space shift keying (SSK). Performance analysis is evaluated in terms of achievable capacity and outage probability under varying inter-RIS distances and carrier frequencies."}

Through asymptotic analysis, we identify a critical spatial scale $n_c=σ^2/v$ separating diffusion- and drift-dominated regimes, revealing that the channel effectively behaves as a ``Truncated Cauchy'' model. Numerical results show that Gaussian approximations severely underestimate capacity at low drift, while the zero-drift case provides the appropriate performance lower bound for systems where drift assists particle transport."}

DiPASS introduces the first channel model that accurately captures the directional, pencil-like radiation of pinching antennas, incorporates a practical waveguide attenuation of 1.3 dB/m, and accounts for stochastic line-of-sight blockage. A key enabler of DiPASS is our new \"equal quota division\" power allocation strategy, which guarantees predetermined coupling lengths independent of antenna positions, thereby overcoming a critical barrier to practical deployment. Our analysis yields foundational insights: we derive closed-form solutions for optimal antenna placement and orientation in single-PA scenarios, quantifying the core trade-off between waveguide and free-space losses. For multi-PA systems, we develop a scalable optimization framework that leverages directional sparsity, revealing that waveguide diversity surpasses antenna density in enhancing system capacity. Extensive simulations validate our analysis and demonstrate that DiPASS provides a realistic performance benchmark, fundamentally reshaping the understanding and design principles for future PASS-enabled 6G networks."}
