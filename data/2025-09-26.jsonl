Prior works have shown that timestamps form a\ndiscrete-time Markov chain, whose stationary distribution can be computed as\nthe leading left eigenvector of a large transition matrix. However,\nconstructing this matrix is known to be computationally expensive because of\nthe coupling between states and the dead time. This paper presents the first\nnon-sequential Markov modeling for the timestamp distribution. The key\ninnovation is an equivalent formulation that reparameterizes the integral\nbounds and separates the effect of dead time as a deterministic row permutation\nof a base matrix. This decoupling enables efficient vectorized matrix\nconstruction, yielding up to $1000 \\times$ acceleration over existing methods.\nThe new model produces a nearly exact stationary distribution when compared\nwith the gold standard Monte Carlo simulations, yet using a fraction of the\ntime.

The arguments for the proof involve a careful\nanalysis of a genie-aided decoder, which knows the correct locations of the\nreads. The converse is not tight in general. However, it meets the\nachievability result asymptotically in some channel parameters."}

An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components,\nthe number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In\nthe same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed.\nFor example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions\nand data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger\ncodes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables\nswitching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while\nreducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable\nSC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design\nprobabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is\nachieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes\nmemory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of\nshort cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability\ndistribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown\ndistribution characterizing the additional components. We use the\ngradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of\ncycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to\ndesign any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other\ncases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC\ncodes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts\nand remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a\nliterature-based straightforward scheme."}

Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on\n  Information Theory", "summary": "This paper studies the capacity of massive random-access cellular networks,\nmodeled as a MIMO fading channel with an infinite number of interfering cells.\nTo characterize the symmetric sum rate of the network, a random-coding argument\nis invoked together with the assumption that in all cells users draw their\ncodebooks according to the same distribution. This can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of the assumption of Gaussian codebooks, often encountered in\nthe literature. The network is further assumed to be noncoherent: the\ntransmitters and receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading\ncoefficients, but are ignorant of their realizations. Finally, it is assumed\nthat the users access the network at random. For the considered channel model,\nrigorous bounds on the capacity are derived. The behavior of these bounds\ndepends critically on the path loss from signals transmitted in interfering\ncells to the intended cell. In particular, if the fading coefficients of the\ninterferers (ordered according to their distance to the receiver) decay\nexponentially or more slowly, then the capacity is bounded in the transmit\npower. This confirms that the saturation regime in interference-limited\nnetworks -- observed by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews (\"Fundamental limits of\ncooperation\", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Sept. 2013) -- cannot be avoided by\nrandom user activity or by using channel inputs beyond the scale family. In\ncontrast, if the fading coefficients decay faster than double-exponentially,\nthen the capacity is unbounded in the transmit power. Proving an unbounded\ncapacity is nontrivial even if the number of interfering cells is finite, since\nthe condition that the users' codebooks follow the same distribution prevents\ninterference-avoiding strategies such as time- or frequency-division multiple\naccess. We obtain this result by using bursty signaling together with treating\ninterference as noise."}

Neural-network-based\nISAC leverages data-driven learning techniques to add sensing capabilities to\nexisting communication infrastructure. This paper presents a novel\nsignal-processing framework for such neural ISAC systems based on the\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) downlink. Our approach enables generalized sensing\nfunctionality without modifying the MIMO-OFDM communication link. Specifically,\nour neural ISAC pipeline measures the backscattered communication signals to\ngenerate discrete map representations of spatial occupancy, formulated as\nmulticlass or multilabel classification problems, which can then be utilized by\nspecialized downstream tasks. To improve sensing performance in closed or\ncluttered environments, our neural ISAC pipeline relies on features\nspecifically designed to mitigate strong reflective paths. Extensive\nsimulations using ray-tracing models demonstrate that our neural ISAC framework\nreliably reconstructs scene maps without altering the MIMO-OFDM communication\npipeline or reducing data rates."}
