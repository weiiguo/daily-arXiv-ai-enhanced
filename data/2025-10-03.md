Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: JaneEye是一个专为可穿戴设备设计的基于事件的眼动追踪硬件加速器，采用轻量级神经网络架构和硬件优化，实现了高精度、低延迟和低功耗的眼动追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于帧的眼动追踪系统在扩展现实(XR)应用中难以满足高精度、低延迟和低功耗的要求，而事件相机提供了超高的时间分辨率和低功耗的替代方案。

Method: 提出超轻量级神经网络架构，包含新颖的ConvJANET层（仅保留遗忘门的简化ConvLSTM），使用自定义线性激活函数近似和定点量化，通过软硬件协同设计实现高效硬件加速。

Result: 在3ET+数据集上达到2.45像素误差的高精度，仅使用17.6K参数，支持1250Hz事件帧率；12nm ASIC实现400MHz运行频率，端到端延迟0.5ms（相当于2000FPS），能效为18.9μJ/帧。

Conclusion: JaneEye为下一代XR可穿戴设备设定了低功耗、高性能眼动追踪解决方案的新基准。

Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in
Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems
often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency,
and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering
ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we
present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware
accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse,
high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural
network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the
traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving
computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our
proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+
dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To
further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of
activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization.
Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at
400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames
Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a
new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable
for integration into next-generation XR wearables.

### [2] [Satellite Assignment Policy Learning for Coexistence in LEO Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01408)
*Jeong Min Kong,Ian P. Roberts*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图结构学习的端到端算法，用于推断低地球轨道卫星系统中主系统的卫星分配策略，以帮助次系统在不干扰主用户的情况下运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LEO卫星系统中，次系统需要避免对主用户造成过度干扰，但主系统的卫星分配策略未公开。因此需要开发方法来推断这些策略。

Method: 使用基于图结构学习的端到端算法，利用有限的历史数据学习主卫星分配策略，能够直接将主卫星坐标映射到主用户的分配决策。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法优于最佳基线，预测准确率提高了约15%。

Conclusion: 所提出的图结构学习方法能有效推断主系统卫星分配策略，为次系统提供可靠的干扰避免机制。

Abstract: Unlike in terrestrial cellular networks, certain frequency bands for
low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems have thus far been allocated on a
non-exclusive basis. In this context, systems that launch their satellites
earlier (referred to as primary systems) are given spectrum access priority
over those that launch later, known as secondary systems. For a secondary
system to function, it is expected to either coordinate with primary systems or
ensure that it does not cause excessive interference to primary ground users.
Reliably meeting this interference constraint requires real-time knowledge of
the receive beams of primary users, which in turn depends on the primary
satellite-to-primary user associations. However, in practice, primary systems
have thus far not publicly disclosed their satellite assignment policies;
therefore, it becomes essential for secondary systems to develop methods to
infer such policies. Assuming there is limited historical data indicating which
primary satellites have served which primary users, we propose an end-to-end
graph structure learning-based algorithm for learning highest elevation primary
satellite assignment policies, that, upon deployment, can directly map the
primary satellite coordinates into assignment decisions for the primary users.
Simulation results show that our method can outperform the best baseline,
achieving approximately a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy.

### [3] [Delay-Augmented Stacked Intelligent Surfaces: Potential, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01411)
*Hibatallah Alwazani,Omran Abbas,Loic Markley,Anas Chaaban*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出延迟增强堆叠智能表面(DA-SIS)概念，通过在SIS中集成延迟单元实现时空信号处理，展示其作为模拟均衡器消除多径干扰的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIS技术主要局限于空间波域信号处理，需要增强时间处理能力以扩展其应用范围，特别是在消除多径引起的符号间干扰方面。

Method: 在堆叠智能表面中集成可调延迟单元，构建DA-SIS系统，将其作为模拟均衡器来消除ISI，并与数字均衡器进行性能对比。

Result: DA-SIS能够有效消除多径干扰，通过比特误码率评估显示其均衡性能，与数字均衡器相比展现出潜力。

Conclusion: 延迟增强SIS为HMIMO和umMIMO技术提供了新的时空处理能力，未来需要进一步研究以实现这一概念的实际应用。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS)s have been proposed recently as an
enabling technology for Holographic Multiple Input Multiple Output (HMIMO) and
Ultra-massive MIMO (umMIMO) technologies. Their utility can extend beyond
spatial wave-domain processing of signals if they are enhanced with
strategically-tuned symbol-duration level delays to enable temporal processing
as well. In this work, we introduce the idea of a delay-augmented SIS (DA-SIS).
We shed light on the feasibility of realizing delay units in an SIS. Then, we
discuss the relevance of the proposed DA-SIS and present a use case that
illustrates its potential, wherein the DA-SIS serves as an analog equalizer
that aids in eliminating multi-path-induced inter-symbol-interference (ISI). We
show how the number of elements affect the equalization process using the bit
error rate (BER) as a metric, and demonstrate the potential of the DA-SIS in
equalization via comparing with digital equalizers as a benchmark. Finally, we
present opportunities and future research directions that can be undertaken to
bring this idea to fruition.

### [4] [A Drone-mounted Magnetometer System for Automatic Interference Removal and Landmine Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01417)
*Alex Paul Hoffmann,Matthew G. Finley,Eftyhia Zesta,Mark B. Moldwin,Lauro V. Ojeda*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无人机双磁力计的有效地雷检测方法，通过两步算法消除无人机电子设备干扰并检测地雷信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地雷在冲突地区长期存在，对平民构成持续威胁，而现有无人机磁力计检测方法受无人机电子设备干扰影响严重。

Method: 使用框架安装的双磁力计载荷，采用WAIC-UP方法消除干扰，然后使用RUDE算法检测地雷信号。

Result: 该方法在蒙特卡洛模拟中验证有效，能够实现高保真度军械检测，计算成本低，且简化了磁测载荷设计。

Conclusion: WAIC-UP/RUDE方法为无人机地雷检测提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案，在不同飞行高度下均表现良好。

Abstract: Landmines have been extensively used in conflict zones as an indiscriminate
weapon to control military movements, often remaining active long after
hostilities have ended. Their presence poses a persistent danger to civilians,
hindering post-war recovery efforts, causing injuries or death, and restricting
access to essential land for agriculture and infrastructure. Unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAV) equipped with magnetometers are commonly used to detect remnant
hidden landmines but come with significant technical challenges due to magnetic
field interference from UAV electronics such as motors. We propose the use of a
frame-mounted UAV-borne two-magnetometer payload to perform a two-step
automated interference removal and landmine detection analysis. The first step
removes interference via the Wavelet-Adaptive Interference Cancellation for
Underdetermined Platform (WAIC-UP) method designed for spaceflight
magnetometers. The second method uses the Rapid Unsupervised Detection of
Events (RUDE) algorithm to detect landmine signatures. This two-step
WAIC-UP/RUDE approach with multiple magnetometers achieves high-fidelity
ordinance detection at a low computational cost and simplifies the design of
magnetic survey payloads. We validate the method through a Monte Carlo
simulation of randomized landmine placements in a 10 x 10 m square grid and
drone motor interference. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of the algorithm
by varying the drone's altitude, examining its performance at different heights
above the ground.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一个全双工场景，基站配备可移动天线，同时为上下行用户提供通信服务并支持目标检测的感知功能，实现集成感知与通信技术。通过联合优化波束成形向量、用户发射功率和天线位置，最大化回波信干噪比，同时满足感知和通信的服务质量要求。

Conclusion: 基于可移动天线的全双工集成感知与通信系统在实用中具有显著优势，所提出的元学习方法能有效解决大规模优化问题。

Abstract: This paper investigates a full-duplex (FD) scenario where a base station (BS)
equipped with movable antennas (MAs) simultaneously provides communication
services to a set of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users while also enabling
sensing functionalities for target detection, thereby supporting integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) technology. Additionally, a receiving BS, also
equipped with MAs (denoted as BS R), is responsible for capturing the reflected
echo. To optimize this setup, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at
maximizing the signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) of the captured
echo. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors
at the FD BS, the receiving beamforming vectors at both the FD BS and BS R, the
UL users' transmit power, and the MAs' positions at both BSs, all while
satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for both sensing and
communication. Given the non-convex nature of the problem and the high coupling
between the variables, we employ a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach
tailored for large-scale optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning approach, achieving results within
99% of the optimal solution. Furthermore, the MA-based scheme outperforms
several benchmark approaches, highlighting its advantages in practical ISAC
applications.

### [6] [The Analysis and Performance of LODC-OFDM Signal in Nonlinear Rydberg Atomic Sensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01605)
*Hao Wu,Xinyuan Yao,Rui Ni,Chen Gong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对里德堡原子传感器的LODC-OFDM方案，解决了宽带OFDM接收的挑战，并通过实验验证了理论分析的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 里德堡原子传感器在射频测量中具有高灵敏度，但其光学接口的单极性特性限制了传统OFDM接收，需要采用单极性OFDM方案。

Method: 建立了里德堡原子传感器的AM-AM特性经验近似函数，基于DCO-OFDM框架提出了LODC-OFDM方案，并采用Bussgang定理分析非线性失真。

Result: 推导了泰勒级数展开和理想预失真情况下的闭式解，实验结果表明理论与实验结果吻合良好。

Conclusion: LODC-OFDM方案有效解决了里德堡原子传感器的宽带OFDM接收问题，为兼容信号传输提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors have been seen as novel radio frequency (RF)
measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it
attractive for communications reception. However, the signal sensing process in
Rydberg system involves sequential transduction from electromagnetic waves to
optical signals and finally to electrical signals. The unipolar characteristic
of the optical interface inherently restricts conventional OFDM reception.
Therefore, adopting unipolar OFDM schemes, inspired by optical communication
systems, becomes essential for compatible signal transmission. In this work, we
investigate the amplitude modulation-to-amplitude modulation (AM-AM)
characteristics of Rydberg atomic sensors, establishing an empirical
approximation function. Building on the direct current-biased optical
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) framework, we propose a
novel local oscillator direct current-biased OFDM (LODC-OFDM) scheme
specifically optimized for Rydberg-based sensing, effectively addressing the
broadband OFDM reception challenge. Then, we adopt Bussgang theorem to analyze
the nonlinear distortion of LODC-OFDM signals and the results in closed-form
solutions are derived for AM/AM curves approximated by Taylor series expansion
and for the ideal pre-distortion case. In real experiments, the experimental
and theoretical results fit well.

Method: 采用新颖的分析方法，推导了1比特量化SIMO系统在QPSK调制和MRC接收下的精确SEP表达式。

Result: 获得了SIMO-MRC系统的精确SEP表达式，并确定了其分集和编码增益；同时量化了SIMO-SC系统在任意接收天线数下的分集和编码增益。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展和补充了先前结果，为1比特量化SIMO系统的性能分析提供了更完整的理论框架。

Abstract: The average symbol error probability (SEP) of a 1-bit quantized single-input
multiple-output (SIMO) system is analyzed under Rayleigh fading channels and
quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Previous studies have
partially characterized the diversity gain for selection combining (SC). In
this paper, leveraging a novel analytical method, an exact analytical SEP
expression is derived for a 1-bit quantized SIMO system employing QPSK
modulation at the transmitter and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the
receiver. The corresponding diversity and coding gains of a SIMO-MRC system are
also determined. Furthermore, the diversity and coding gains of a 1-bit
quantized SIMO-SC system are quantified for an arbitrary number of receive
antennas, thereby extending and complementing prior results.

### [8] [3D 8-Ary Noise Modulation Using Bayesian- and Kurtosis-based Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01748)
*Hadi Zayyani,Felipe A. P. de Figueiredo,Mohammad Salman,Rausley A. A. de Souza*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的三维8元噪声调制方案，通过引入高斯混合分布的概率维度，在均值和方差维度基础上增加第三个维度，使每个传输符号携带3比特信息，数据速率比现有方案提高1.5-3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有噪声调制方案通常只使用均值和方差两个维度，限制了数据速率。为了进一步提高通信系统的数据速率和频谱效率，需要开发新的调制维度。

Method: 采用高斯混合分布的概率作为第三维度，每个符号对应三个子信道比特。使用阈值检测器（均值调制）、最大似然检测器（方差调制）、峰度检测器、Jarque-Bera测试和贝叶斯假设检测器（概率调制）的组合检测方案。

Result: 仿真结果显示，第三子信道比特的误码率与现有二维方案相当，数据速率比广义二次噪声调制器和经典二进制KLJN噪声调制器分别提高1.5倍和3倍。峰度检测器复杂度低，误码率约为0.06。

Conclusion: 所提出的三维噪声调制方案成功扩展了调制维度，在保持可接受误码率的同时显著提高了数据速率，为噪声调制通信系统提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) 8-ary noise modulation
scheme that introduces a new dimension: the mixture probability of a Mixture of
Gaussian (MoG) distribution. This proposed approach utilizes the dimensions of
mean and variance, in addition to the new probability dimension. Within this
framework, each transmitted symbol carries three bits, each corresponding to a
distinct sub-channel. For detection, a combination of specialized detectors is
employed: a simple threshold based detector for the first sub-channel bit
(modulated by the mean), a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector for the second
sub-channel bit (modulated by the variance), a Kurtosis-based, Jarque-Bera (JB)
test, and Bayesian Hypothesis (BHT)-based detectors for the third bit
(modulated by the MoG probability). The Kurtosis- and JB-based detectors
specifically distinguish between Gaussian (or near-Gaussian) and non-Gaussian
MoG distributions by leveraging higher-order statistical measures. The Bit
Error Probabilities (BEPs) are derived for the threshold-, Kurtosis-, and
BHT-based detectors. The optimum threshold for the Kurtosis-based detector is
also derived in a tractable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that a
comparably low BEP is achieved for the third sub-channel bit relative to
existing two-dimensional (2D) schemes. Simultaneously, the proposed scheme
increases the data rate by a factor of 1.5 and 3 compared to the Generalized
Quadratic noise modulator and the classical binary KLJN noise modulator,
respectively. Furthermore, the Kurtosis-based detector offers a low-complexity
solution, achieving an acceptable BEP of approximately 0.06.

Motivation: 研究在参数和噪声分布受Wasserstein距离约束的线性测量模型中，如何解决无限维非凸极小极大问题，特别是鞍点存在性问题。

Result: 给出了鞍点存在的可验证条件，证明了当Wasserstein半径足够小时鞍点总是存在，并在无鞍点时提供了鲁棒线性估计器的构造方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为Wasserstein距离约束下的鲁棒估计问题提供了理论分析和实用解决方案，包括鞍点存在性条件和鲁棒估计器的构造方法。

Abstract: This paper primarily considers the robust estimation problem under
Wasserstein distance constraints on the parameter and noise distributions in
the linear measurement model with additive noise, which can be formulated as an
infinite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem. We prove that the existence of
a saddle point for this problem is equivalent to that for a finite-dimensional
minimax problem, and give a counterexample demonstrating that the saddle point
may not exist. Motivated by this observation, we present a verifiable necessary
and sufficient condition whose parameters can be derived from a convex problem
and its dual. Additionally, we also introduce a simplified sufficient
condition, which intuitively indicates that when the Wasserstein radii are
small enough, the saddle point always exists. In the absence of the saddle
point, we solve an finite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem, obtained by
restricting the estimator to be linear. Its optimal value establishes an upper
bound on the robust estimation problem, while its optimal solution yields a
robust linear estimator. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate
our theoretical results.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出通过叠加两个广义二次噪声调制器(GQNM)输出创建16进制噪声调制器，类似于经典通信中的QAM调制器，在信息比特的四个不同均值和四个不同方差上进行调制，可获得比KLJN和GQNM调制器更好的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 为了创建更高阶的噪声调制方案，提高通信系统性能，通过叠加多个GQNM调制器实现类似于经典QAM调制的噪声调制器。

Method: 通过简单叠加两个GQNM调制器的输出创建16进制噪声调制器，在四个不同均值和四个不同方差上调制信息比特，通过选择满足理论可区分性条件的参数来优化性能。

Result: 仿真验证表明，该方法相比KLJN调制器和GQNM调制器具有更好的性能，实现了更低的误比特概率(BEP)。

Conclusion: 通过增加调制器、发射机和接收机检测器的复杂度，可以获得更好的性能，该方法可扩展到高于16进制的调制方案，但需要进一步研究。

Abstract: This letter proposes superposing two Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulators
(GQNM) by simply adding their outputs. It creates a 16-ary noise modulator that
resembles QAM modulators in classical communication. It modulates the
information bits on four different means and four different variances. It could
also be applied to reach higher-order modulations than 16-ary schemes by adding
the outputs of more than two modulators, which is not discussed in detail in
this letter and left for future work. By selecting the parameters necessary for
satisfying the theoretical distinguishability conditions provided in the paper,
we can reach better performances in comparison to the Kirchhoff-Law Johnson
Noise (KLJN) modulator and the GQNM modulator, which is verified by the
simulations. The better result in terms of smaller Bit Error Probability (BEP)
is achieved by increasing the complexity in the modulator, the transmitter, and
the detectors in the receiver.

Conclusion: 结合多普勒和ToA测量的定位算法能有效解决非凸优化问题，提供闭式解，且无人机轨迹设计也有闭式解，整体方法高效可行。

Abstract: In this paper, a single Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle (UAV)-aided localization
algorithm which uses both Doppler and Time of Arrival (ToA) measurements is
presented. In contrast to Doppler-based localization algorithms which are based
on non-convex functions, exploiting ToA measurements in a Least-Square (LS)
Doppler-based cost function, leads to a quadratic convex function whose
minimizer lies on a line. Utilizing the ToA measurements in addition to the
linear equation of minimizer, a closed form solution is obtained for the
emitter location using a constrained LS optimization. In addition, a trajectory
design of the UAV is provided which has also closed-form solution. Simulation
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in
comparison to some others in the literature.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology offers a flexible approach to enhancing
wireless channel conditions by adjusting antenna positions within a designated
region. While most existing works focus on narrowband MA systems, this paper
investigates MA position optimization for an MA-enhanced multiple-input
single-output (MISO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system.
This problem appears to be particularly challenging due to the frequency-flat
nature of MA positioning, which should accommodate the channel conditions
across different subcarriers. To overcome this challenge, we discretize the
movement region into a multitude of sampling points, thereby converting the
continuous position optimization problem into a discrete point selection
problem. Although this problem is combinatorial, we develop an efficient
partial enumeration algorithm to find the optimal solution using a
branch-and-bound framework, where a graph-theoretic method is incorporated to
effectively prune suboptimal solutions. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
regime, a simplified graph-based algorithm is also proposed to obtain the
optimal MA positions without the need for enumeration. Simulation results
reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed-position
antennas (FPAs), while narrowband-based antenna position optimization can
achieve near-optimal performance.

Conclusion: NGGAN能够有效学习NB-PLC系统中实际噪声的复杂特性，生成更接近真实噪声的数据，为数据增强和噪声处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive
noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband
powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical
noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive
noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the
noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of
practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the
statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise
via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC
modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches
based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the
length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate
cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss
function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training
dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various
applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based
models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform
quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a
piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a
frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC
systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using
waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms
of the quality of the generated noise.

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition based on biosignals has shown strong potential for
developing intuitive human-machine interaction strategies that closely mimic
natural human behavior. In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained
attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the
limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and
reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and
A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on
power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete
gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-low-power (sub-50 mW)
system for concurrent acquisition of 8-channel EMG and 4-channel A-mode US
signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable,
dry-contact armbands. We propose a framework for continuous tracking of 23
degrees of freedom (DoFs), 20 for the hand and 3 for the wrist, using a
kinematic glove for ground-truth labeling. Our method employs lightweight
encoder-decoder architectures with multi-task learning to simultaneously
estimate hand and wrist joint angles. Experimental results under realistic
sensor repositioning conditions demonstrate that EMG-US fusion achieves a root
mean squared error of $10.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$, compared to
$12.0^\circ\pm1^\circ$ for EMG and $13.1^\circ\pm2.6^\circ$ for US, and a R$^2$
score of $0.61\pm0.1$, with $0.54\pm0.03$ for EMG and $0.38\pm0.20$ for US.

Abstract: Inspired by Costa's pioneering work on dirty paper coding (DPC), this paper
proposes a novel scheme for integrated communication and computing (ICC), named
Computing on Dirty Paper, whereby the transmission of discrete data symbols for
communication, and over-the-air computation (AirComp) of nomographic functions
can be achieved simultaneously over common multiple-access channels. In
particular, the proposed scheme allows for the integration of communication and
computation in a manner that is asymptotically interference-free, by
precanceling the computing symbols at the transmitters (TXs) using DPC
principles. A simulation-based assessment of the proposed ICC scheme under a
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) setup is also offered, including the
evaluation of performance for data detection, and of mean-squared-error (MSE)
performance for function computation, over a block of symbols. The results
validate the proposed method and demonstrate its ability to significantly
outperform state-of-the-art (SotA) ICC schemes in terms of both bit error rate
(BER) and MSE.

Result: 广泛仿真验证了JMD在干扰抑制方面的有效性，能够应对动态变化的智能多天线干扰。

Conclusion: JMD范式消除了专用训练阶段的需求，同时能够有效缓解智能和动态多天线干扰器的威胁。

Abstract: Multi-antenna (or MIMO) processing is a promising solution to the problem of
jammer mitigation. Existing methods mitigate the jammer based on an estimate of
its spatial signature that is acquired through a dedicated training phase. This
strategy has two main drawbacks: (i) it reduces the communication rate since no
data can be transmitted during the training phase and (ii) it can be evaded by
smart or multi-antenna jammers that do not transmit during the training phase
or that dynamically change their subspace through time-varying beamforming. To
address these drawbacks, we propose Joint jammer Mitigation and data Detection
(JMD), a novel paradigm for MIMO jammer mitigation. The core idea of JMD is to
estimate and remove the jammer interference subspace jointly with detecting the
legitimate transmit data over multiple time slots. Doing so removes the need
for a dedicated and rate-reducing training period while being able to mitigate
smart and dynamic multi-antenna jammers. We provide two JMD-type algorithms,
SANDMAN and MAED, that differ in the way they estimate the channels of the
legitimate transmitters and achieve different complexity-performance tradeoffs.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of JMD for jammer mitigation.

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has garnered significant
attention due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios, coupled
with multiple waveform parameters that provide greater degrees of freedom for
system design. This paper introduces a novel secure affine frequency division
multiplexing (SE-AFDM) system, which advances prior designs by dynamically
varying an AFDM pre-chirp parameter to enhance physical-layer security. In the
SE-AFDM system, the pre-chirp parameter is dynamically generated from a
codebook controlled by a long-period pseudo-noise (LPPN) sequence. Instead of
applying spreading in the data domain, our parameter-domain spreading approach
provides additional security while maintaining reliability and high spectrum
efficiency. We also propose a synchronization framework to solve the problem of
reliably and rapidly synchronizing the time-varying parameter in fast
time-varying channels. The theoretical derivations prove that unsynchronized
eavesdroppers cannot eliminate the nonlinear impact of the time-varying
parameter and further provide useful guidance for codebook design. Simulation
results demonstrate the security advantages of the proposed SE-AFDM system in
high-mobility scenarios, while our hardware prototype validates the
effectiveness of the proposed synchronization framework.

Abstract: This paper investigates joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) and attitude sensing
using tri-polarized continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs). By employing
electromagnetic (EM) information theory, the spatially continuous received
signals in tri-polarized CAPA are modeled, thereby enabling accurate DOA and
attitude estimation. To facilitate subspace decomposition for continuous
operators, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation technique is
developed. Moreover, both self- and cross-covariances of tri-polarized signals
are exploited to construct a tri-polarized spectrum, significantly enhancing
DOA estimation performance. Theoretical analyses reveal that the
identifiability of attitude information fundamentally depends on the
availability of prior target snapshots. Accordingly, two attitude estimation
algorithms are proposed: one capable of estimating partial attitude information
without prior knowledge, and the other achieving full attitude estimation when
such knowledge is available. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and
superiority of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: 该研究成功实现了感知安全的ISAC框架，在通信、合法感知和感知安全性之间建立了三向权衡关系，为ISAC系统的安全部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) brings along
unprecedented vulnerabilities to authorized sensing, necessitating the
development of secure solutions. Sensing parameters are embedded within the
target-reflected signal leaked to unauthorized passive radar sensing
eavesdroppers (Eve), implying that they can silently extract sensory
information without prior knowledge of the information data. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a sensing-secure ISAC framework that ensures secure
target detection and estimation for the legitimate system, while obfuscating
unauthorized sensing without requiring any prior knowledge of Eve. By
introducing artificial imperfections into the ambiguity function (AF) of ISAC
signals, we introduce artificial targets into Eve's range profile which
increase its range estimation ambiguity. In contrast, the legitimate sensing
receiver (Alice) can suppress these AF artifacts using mismatched filtering,
albeit at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. Employing an OFDM
signal, a structured subcarrier power allocation scheme is designed to shape
the secure autocorrelation function (ACF), inserting periodic peaks to mislead
Eve's range estimation and degrade target detection performance. To quantify
the sensing security, we introduce peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated
sidelobe level (ISL) as key performance metrics. Then, we analyze the three-way
trade-offs between communication, legitimate sensing, and sensing security,
highlighting the impact of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling on system
performance. We formulate a convex optimization problem to maximize ISAC
performance while guaranteeing a certain sensing security level. Numerical
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC
signaling, demonstrating its ability to degrade Eve's target estimation while
preserving Alice's performance.

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架成功解决了符号级预编码的高复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率，适用于完美和不完美CSI场景。

Abstract: Although symbol-level precoding (SLP) based on constructive interference (CI)
exploitation offers performance gains, its high complexity remains a
bottleneck. This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the
structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent
tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input
induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the
computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known
closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP)
and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a
mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on
which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that
delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging
these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE
module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we
design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary
variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures
substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately
80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong
generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.

Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver processing is a key
technology for current and next-generation wireless communications. However, it
faces significant challenges related to complexity and scalability as the
number of antennas increases. Artificial intelligence (AI), a cornerstone of
next-generation wireless networks, offers considerable potential for addressing
these challenges. This paper proposes an AI-driven, universal MIMO receiver
architecture based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Unlike
existing AI-based methods that treat receiver processing as a black box, our
MCMC-based approach functions as a generic Bayesian computing engine applicable
to various processing tasks, including channel estimation, symbol detection,
and channel decoding. This method enhances the interpretability, scalability,
and flexibility of receivers in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed
approach integrates these tasks into a unified probabilistic framework, thereby
enabling overall performance optimization. This unified framework can also be
seamlessly combined with data-driven learning methods to facilitate the
development of fully intelligent communication receivers.

Abstract: DNA strings and their properties are widely studied since last 20 years due
to its applications in DNA computing. In this area, one designs a set of DNA
strings (called DNA code) which satisfies certain thermodynamic and
combinatorial constraints such as reverse constraint, reverse-complement
constraint, $GC$-content constraint and Hamming constraint. However recent
applications of DNA codes in DNA data storage resulted in many new constraints
on DNA codes such as avoiding tandem repeats constraint (a generalization of
non-homopolymer constraint) and avoiding secondary structures constraint.
Therefore, in this chapter, we introduce DNA codes with recently developed
constraints. In particular, we discuss reverse, reverse-complement,
$GC$-content, Hamming, uncorrelated-correlated, thermodynamic, avoiding tandem
repeats and avoiding secondary structures constraints. DNA codes are
constructed using various approaches such as algebraic, computational, and
combinatorial. In particular, in algebraic approaches, one uses a finite ring
and a map to construct a DNA code. Most of such approaches does not yield DNA
codes with high Hamming distance. In this chapter, we focus on algebraic
constructions using maps (usually an isometry on some finite ring) which yields
DNA codes with high Hamming distance. We focus on non-cyclic DNA codes. We
briefly discuss various metrics such as Gau distance, Non-Homopolymer distance
etc. We discuss about algebraic constructions of families of DNA codes that
satisfy multiple constraints and/or properties. Further, we also discuss about
algebraic bounds on DNA codes with multiple constraints. Finally, we present
some open research directions in this area.

Motivation: 随着并行硬件平台的发展，需要满足高吞吐量和低延迟要求的高效通用解码器。软判决GRAND虽然能达到最大似然解码，但其固有的串行特性阻碍了并行化，导致高解码延迟。

Method: 利用统一的错误模式树表示法，提出了并行SGRAND设计，通过剪枝策略和基于树的计算保持ML最优性，同时开发了混合GRAND算法，将EP树表示与ORBGRAND结合。

Conclusion: 基于EP树的并行GRAND解码器设计有效解决了软判决GRAND的延迟问题，在保持ML解码性能的同时显著提升了并行效率，为高效通用解码器的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Advances in parallel hardware platforms have motivated the development of
efficient universal decoders capable of meeting stringent throughput and
latency requirements. Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) is a
recently proposed decoding paradigm that sequentially tests Error Patterns
(EPs) until finding a valid codeword. While Soft GRAND (SGRAND) achieves
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding, its inherently sequential nature hinders
parallelism and results in high decoding latency. In this work, we utilize a
unified binary tree representation of EPs, termed the EP tree, which enables
compact representation, efficient manipulation, and parallel exploration.
Building upon this EP tree representation, we propose a parallel design of
SGRAND, preserving its ML optimality while significantly reducing decoding
latency through pruning strategies and tree-based computation. Furthermore, we
develop a hybrid GRAND algorithm that enhances Ordered Reliability Bits (ORB)
GRAND with the EP tree representation, thereby achieving ML decoding with
minimal additional computational cost beyond ORBGRAND while retaining parallel
efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that parallel SGRAND achieves a
$3.75\times$ acceleration compared to serial implementation, while the hybrid
enhanced method achieves a $4.8\times$ acceleration, with further gains
expected under hardware mapping.

Motivation: BCH码是重要的纠错码，具有强大的代数结构、多错误纠正能力和高效解码算法。尽管其实际重要性已被广泛研究，但其参数（包括维数、最小距离和Bose距离）在一般情况下仍然未知。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 研究长度为$(q^m - 1)/\lambda$的BCH码，其中$\lambda$是$q - 1$的正因子。对于$m \geq 4$的窄带BCH码，在设计的距离$\delta$的较大范围内，推导维数和Bose距离的显式公式，并推广到某些非窄带BCH码。

Result: 对于窄带BCH码，在$2 \leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda} + 1$范围内给出了维数的显式公式，在$2 \leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda}$范围内给出了Bose距离的显式公式。这些范围显著大于先前已知的结果。

Conclusion: 本文成功推导了BCH码在更大设计距离范围内的维数和Bose距离的显式公式，并识别出几个具有良好参数的BCH码，为BCH码的参数研究提供了重要进展。

Abstract: BCH codes are important error correction codes, widely utilized due to their
robust algebraic structure, multi-error correcting capability, and efficient
decoding algorithms. Despite their practical importance and extensive study,
their parameters, including dimension, minimum distance and Bose distance,
remain largely unknown in general. This paper addresses this challenge by
investigating the dimension and Bose distance of BCH codes of length $(q^m -
1)/\lambda$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\lambda$ is a positive
divisor of $q - 1$. Specifically, for narrow-sense BCH codes of this length
with $m \geq 4$, we derive explicit formulas for their dimension for designed
distance $2 \leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda}
+ 1$. We also provide explicit formulas for their Bose distance in the range $2
\leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda}$. These
ranges for $\delta$ are notably larger than the previously known results for
this class of BCH codes. Furthermore, we extend these findings to determine the
dimension and Bose distance for certain non-narrow-sense BCH codes of the same
length. Applying our results, we identify several BCH codes with good
parameters.

Conclusion: 所提出的RUOM算法在RIS增强的无人机NOMA网络中有效平衡了公平性和资源效率。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of downlink non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) communication in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks enhanced
by partitionable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). We analyze three
types of links between base station (BS) and UAVs: direct, RIS-only indirect,
and composite links, under both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-LoS (NLoS)
propagation. The RIS-only indirect link and direct link are modeled using
double Nakagami-m and Nakagami-m fading, respectively, while the composite link
follows a combined fading channel model. Closed-form expressions for the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) are derived for all links, enabling tractable outage probability
analysis. Then, we formulate a fairness-efficiency bilevel optimization problem
to minimize the maximum outage probability among UAVs while minimizing the
total number of required RIS reflecting elements. Accordingly, an RIS-assisted
UAV Outage Minimization (RUOM) algorithm is proposed, which fairly allocates
the NOMA power coefficients while minimizing the total number of RIS reflecting
elements required, subject to NOMA-defined constraints, RIS resource
limitations, and maximum allowable outage threshold. Simulation results
validate the analytical models and demonstrate that the proposed RUOM algorithm
significantly improves fairness and efficiency in BS-UAV communication.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret
keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice
and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We
propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the
variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice
and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their
observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high
agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is
realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial
training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction
reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is
guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study
physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely
on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus
suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility
scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps
measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified
through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR)
measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's
position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of
both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation
method.

Abstract: Quantum sensing has attracted significant attention due to its ability to
measure physical quantities with extremely high accuracy. Rydberg atoms -
typically alkali atoms with a highly excited valence electron that is far from
the nucleus - exhibit strong sensitivity to external electromagnetic fields.
This sensitivity leads to coupling between different atomic energy levels,
which can be observed by monitoring changes in a control laser beam before and
after it passes through a vapor cell containing the Rydberg atoms. By analyzing
the transmitted laser signal with a photodetector, variations in transmission
can be attributed to the presence and characteristics of the external
electromagnetic field. Because Rydberg atoms operate in a highly excited
quantum state without relying on traditional electronic circuitry, they
inherently avoid thermal noise, thereby enabling more sensitive detection. In
this paper, we investigate the performance of a Rydberg atomic receiver based
on Rb-85 and compare it with that of a conventional receiver in detecting an
8-level pulse amplitude modulation (8-PAM) signal in the presence of
off-resonant interference. We demonstrate that the Rydberg receiver can
suppress interference without the need for an additional filter. Effectively,
our results show that the Rydberg receiver serves as an integrated filter and
demodulator, outperforming conventional circuit-based receivers in terms of
achievable symbol error rate

Conclusion: 联合考虑语义相关性和信道状态的方法在无线协作边缘推理中表现优越，特别是在恶劣传播条件下，能够显著提升推理性能。

Abstract: We focus on collaborative edge inference over wireless, which enables
multiple devices to cooperate to improve inference performance in the presence
of corrupted data. Exploiting a key-query mechanism for selective information
exchange (or, group formation for collaboration), we recall the effect of
wireless channel impairments in feature communication. We argue and show that a
disjoint approach, which only considers either the semantic relevance or
channel state between devices, performs poorly, especially in harsh propagation
conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a joint approach that takes
into account semantic information relevance and channel states when grouping
devices for collaboration, by making the general attention weights dependent of
the channel information. Numerical simulations show the superiority of the
joint approach against local inference on corrupted data, as well as compared
to collaborative inference with disjoint decisions that either consider
application or physical layer parameters when forming groups.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the framework of collaborative inference, or edge
ensembles. This framework enables multiple edge devices to improve
classification accuracy by exchanging intermediate features rather than raw
observations. However, efficient communication strategies are essential to
balance accuracy and bandwidth limitations. Building upon a key-query mechanism
for selective information exchange, this work extends collaborative inference
by studying the impact of channel noise in feature communication, the choice of
intermediate collaboration points, and the communication-accuracy trade-off
across tasks. By analyzing how different collaboration points affect
performance and exploring communication pruning, we show that it is possible to
optimize accuracy while minimizing resource usage. We show that the
intermediate collaboration approach is robust to channel errors and that the
query transmission needs a higher degree of reliability than the data
transmission itself.
