The introduction of frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz), comprising non-contiguous sub-bands across a wide frequency span, further reinforces the importance of multi-band operation. In such scenarios, frequency-dependent propagation effects that are collectively referred to as dense multipath components (DMC), including clutter, diffraction, and diffuse scattering, must be carefully considered. Building on prior literature and our experimental observations, this paper proposes a novel ISAC channel analysis tailored to multi-band sensing, based on a channel model with background DMCs. It also assesses the sensing trade-offs among sub-bands by analyzing Cramér-Rao bound (CRB)-based fundamental limits. Furthermore, a scalable multi-band estimator is proposed that resolves angular ambiguities arising from the grating lobes effect. Simulation results of the multi-band estimator demonstrate substantial gains in estimation accuracy and reductions in false alarm rate over single-band estimators operating on each constituent sub-band within the CRB-achieving regime. In a representative test case, the proposed estimator achieves reductions of 37.41% and 17.04% in the root mean squared error of delay estimation compared to single-band estimators operating at 8.75 GHz and 21.7 GHz, respectively."}

To address these limitations, we propose a discrete representation of sEMG signals based on a physiology-informed tokenization framework. The method employs a sliding window aligned with the minimal muscle contraction cycle to isolate individual muscle activation events. From each window, ten time-frequency features, including root mean square (RMS) and median frequency (MDF), are extracted, and K-means clustering is applied to group segments into representative muscle-state tokens. We also introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset, ActionEMG-43, comprising 43 diverse actions and sEMG recordings from 16 major muscle groups across the body. Based on this dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations to assess the inter-subject consistency, representation capacity, and interpretability of the proposed sEMG tokens. Our results show that the token representation exhibits high inter-subject consistency (Cohen's Kappa = 0.82+-0.09), indicating that the learned tokens capture consistent and subject-independent muscle activation patterns. In action recognition tasks, models using sEMG tokens achieve Top-1 accuracies of 75.5% with ViT and 67.9% with SVM, outperforming raw-signal baselines (72.8% and 64.4%, respectively), despite a 96% reduction in input dimensionality. In movement quality assessment, the tokens intuitively reveal patterns of muscle underactivation and compensatory activation, offering interpretable insights into neuromuscular control. Together, these findings highlight the effectiveness of tokenized sEMG representations as a compact, generalizable, and physiologically meaningful feature space for applications in rehabilitation, human-machine interaction, and motor function analysis."}

To safeguard confidential transmissions, we formulate a new secrecy rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming vector and a continuous FAA shape control parameter. Due to the non convex nature of the problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed to decompose the joint design into tractable subproblems, which are solved iteratively to refine both the FAA geometry and beamforming strategy. Simulation results confirm that the proposed joint optimization framework significantly outperforms conventional fixed shape or beamforming only schemes, demonstrating the potential of FAA enabled reconfigurability for secure wireless communications."}

While polynomials inherently possess smoothness, it is particularly interesting to investigate their behavior under convolution. This interest stems from the fact that numerous engineering and physical phenomena can be modeled through such operations, including weighted averages, blurring effects and convolutional integral equations. In this work, we show that under certain mild conditions, the convolution with any even Schwartz function acts as an automorphism on the vector space of finite-order polynomials. We derive explicit equations for the inverse operation of this convolution, which are numerically simple to implement. In addition, we extend the deconvolution with (not necessarily even) Schwartz functions to a broader class of functions, including $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$, $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, the Schwartz space and tempered distributions. Specifically, we establish a explicit rigorous formula for the deconvolution of a function or distribution that has been convolved with a Schwartz function, being a particular example the Weierstrass Transform. For the latter, we show that any Schwartz function and tempered distribution that has been transformed, can be recovered, in their respective topologies, by the limit of a sequence of linear combination of recursive convolutions. This provides a new formula for the inverse of the Weierstrass Transform that can be numerically implemented."}

This paper proposes a coupling-aware, wideband, circuit-based framework that captures frequency-dependent mutual coupling and wideband channel responses over multiple subbands. Based on this model, we formulate a joint active and passive beamforming design that optimizes the base-station precoder to enable carrier aggregation across frequency-selective subbands, together with metasurface phase shifts, to maximize spectral efficiency. Simulation results reveal the importance of accounting for coupling and wideband effects, and show that performance depends strongly on operating conditions. Single-layer RIS configurations can be favorable in narrowband and/or low-SNR regimes, whereas SIMs can significantly outperform under wideband multi-user conditions by mitigating coupling-induced distortion and maintaining a more consistent phase response across frequencies. The results provide physical insights into design trade-offs between structural simplicity and wideband adaptability, highlighting SIMs as a scalable solution for future-generation wideband multi-user MIMO systems.

Despite strong predictive performance, many models rely on statistical correlations that are unstable across acquisition settings, patient populations, and institutional practices, limiting robustness, interpretability, and clinical trust. We advocate a causal signal processing perspective in which biomedical signals are treated as effects of latent generative mechanisms rather than as isolated predictive inputs. Using clinical risk prediction as a motivating example, we show how disease-related factors generate observable biomarkers, while acquisition processes act as confounders influencing signal appearance. In clinical disease risk prediction from chest CT scans and patient risk factors, correlational models may fail under scanner changes, whereas causal abstractions remain invariant. Building on this view, we propose a unifying conceptual framework integrating causal modeling with learning-based signal processing and neuro-symbolic reasoning. Statistical models extract multimodal representations that are mapped to interpretable causal abstractions and combined with symbolic knowledge encoding clinical risk factors and guidelines. This structure enables clinically grounded explanations, counterfactual reasoning about hypothetical interventions, and improved robustness to distribution shifts arising from changes in acquisition conditions or screening policies. Rather than introducing a specific algorithm, this article presents schematic causal structures and a comparative analysis of correlation-based, causal, and neuro-symbolic approaches to guide the design of robust and interpretable medical decision-support systems."}

In commonly adopted channel models for CFmMIMO networks, inter-AP channel correlation is assumed to be absent, thereby eliminating the potential benefits of centralized processing. However, by carefully designing the pilot transmission phase, the AP received signals during pilot transmission can become correlated, and thus, centralization can improve channel estimation performance, despite the absence of inter-AP channel correlation. In this paper, we propose a channel estimation scheme, termed master-assisted channel estimation (MACE), that aims to leverage inter-AP signal correlation by means of partially centralized processing and hence improve channel estimation performance. In MACE, a subset of APs fuse and forward their received pilot signals to a master AP, which then performs channel estimation using the fused signals together with its locally received signals. This scheme strikes a balance between local and fully centralized processing by leveraging inter-AP signal correlation, while reducing fronthaul signaling and computational complexity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that MACE consistently outperforms local channel estimation, where inter-AP signal correlation is neglected."}

F. de Almeida"], "title": "Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal RIS Exploiting Core Tensor Sparsity", "comment": null, "summary": "Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS)s enhance wave manipulation through inter-element couplings but pose significant channel estimation challenges due to cascaded channels and block-Kronecker structures. This paper proposes a compressive sensing framework exploiting sparse Tucker decomposition of the measurement tensor and the Kronecker rank-one structure of channel components. Two algorithms are developed: Sparse Tensor Orthogonal Recovery Method (STORM), which uses orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for greedy support recovery, and Sparse Tensor subspace- Aided Recovery (STAR), which leverages subspace-based projection for enhanced noise robustness. Both perform joint sparse support identification, followed by a Kronecker rank-one factorization via singular value decomposition (SVD) to recover the channel parameters. Simulations show that STAR achieves oracle-assisted least squares (LS) performance at moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with significantly fewer measurements than baseline methods, enabling practical BD-RIS deployment in next-generation millimeter wave (mmWave)/sub-terahertz (sub-THz) networks."}

This work proposes a novel deep learning-based antenna coding optimization algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is supported by a heterogeneous multi-head selection mechanism, whose main idea is to train multiple neural networks based on various coding schemes and select the one that leads to the best system performance. Unlike traditional heuristic searching-based algorithms that require high computational complexity to achieve satisfactory performance, the proposed data-driven deep learning approach can achieve 98\\% of the performance achieved by the searching-based algorithms with significantly reduced computational complexity. Results demonstrate that in pixel antenna empowered single-input single-output systems, the proposed algorithm achieves a computational speed 81 times faster than the searching-based algorithm. For more complex pixel antenna empowered multiple-input multiple-output systems, the computational speed is 297 times faster than the existing searching-based algorithm. Benefiting from the high performance and low computational complexity, this algorithm demonstrates the significant potential of pixel antennas as a novel and practical technology to enhance wireless systems."}
