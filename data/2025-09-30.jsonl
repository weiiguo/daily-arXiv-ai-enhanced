Existing approaches often\ndepend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize\nto rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that\nintegrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and\ndecision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using\nsynchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is\nemployed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error\nand discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary\ndecision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational\nefficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error\ndistributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and\nclassification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an\nidentification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs.\nThis design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically\nclassifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a\nkey limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and\nenvelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further\nhighlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for\nwide-area event analysis in modern power systems."}

In OvEP, the large-scale measurement\nvector is partitioned into partially overlapping blocks. For each block and its\noverlapping part, a low-complexity linear minimum mean square error\n(LMMSE)-based filter is designed according to the partitioned structure. The\nresulting LMMSE outputs are then combined to generate the input to the\ndenoiser.

Traditional methods, such as empirical\nmodel-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement\nrequirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches\noften struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave\nequation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network\n(cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for\nAP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss\ndistributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN\nto create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions,\nsignificantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In\nthe DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the\naction space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal\nimprovement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances\nconvergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the\nlikelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show\nthat the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and\ntraditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received\npower, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency.
