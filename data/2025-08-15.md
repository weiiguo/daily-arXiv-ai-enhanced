### [1] [Using nonassociative algebras to classify skew polycyclic codes up to isometry and equivalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10139)
*Susanne Pumpluen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了新的斜多环码的等价和等距定义，以减少已知的分类数量并明确不同概念的重合条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更精确地分类斜多环码，避免重复现有代码，并消除对代码长度的限制。

Method: 利用斜多环码的生成器与主左理想的生成器的一一对应关系，通过代数同构保持汉明距离来分类代码。

Result: 减少了等价和等距类的数量，明确了不同概念的重合条件，并适用于非结合代数。

Conclusion: 新定义提供了更紧的分类方法，适用于更广泛的代码类型，包括秩度量线性码。

Abstract: We propose new definitions of equivalence and isometry for skew polycyclic
codes that will lead to tighter classifications than existing ones. This helps
to reduce the number of previously known isometry and equivalence classes, and
state precisely when these different notions coincide. In the process, we
classify classes of skew $(f,\sigma,\delta)$-polycyclic codes with the same
performance parameters, to avoid duplicating already existing codes.
  We exploit that the generator of a skew polycyclic code is in one-one
correspondence with the generator of a principal left ideal in its ambient
algebra. Algebra isomorphisms that preserve the Hamming distance (called
isometries) map generators of principal left ideals to generators of principal
left ideals and preserve length, dimension and Hamming distance of the codes.
We allow the ambient algebras to be nonassociative, thus eliminating the need
on restrictions on the length of the codes. The isometries between the ambient
algebras can also be used to classify corresponding linear codes equipped with
the rank metric.

### [2] [Space-time Coded Differential Modulation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10244)
*Jiawei Qiu,Harry Leib*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合差分空时调制（DSTM）和差分反射调制（DRM）的方案，以绕过可重构智能表面（RIS）系统中信道状态信息（CSI）的需求，同时提高误码率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIS技术是6G系统的关键技术，但CSI获取困难。本文旨在解决这一问题，同时提升系统性能。

Method: 采用基于酉群码的DSTM方案，并与DRM结合，扩展了反射模式数量（K=2,3,4），并研究了编解码复杂度。

Result: 仿真结果表明，DRM-DSTM编码系统在准静态瑞利衰落信道中优于未编码的DRM方案。

Conclusion: DRM-DSTM方案有效解决了RIS系统中CSI获取的难题，并提供了性能优势。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) hold the promise of improving
significantly coverage, as well as spectral and energy efficiency in wireless
communication systems. Techniques based on RIS form a key technology for 6G
systems. An important issue in RIS technology is Channel State Information
(CSI), which is much more difficult to acquire in such systems. This work
introduces a Differential Space-Time Modulation (DSTM) scheme integrated with
Differential Reflecting Modulation (DRM) to bypass the requirement for CSI in
such systems, while providing error rate gains. The DSTM scheme is based on
unitary group codes. We first consider uncoded DRM for RIS to serve as a
reference point. Next we provide an overview of DSTM and outline the procedures
for its integration with DRM. Furthermore, we explore the extension of both the
original DRM and the coded DRM-DSTM scheme to a larger number of RIS reflecting
patterns $K$, and provide tables of codes for $K= 2, 3, 4$. Encoding and
decoding complexities are studied as well. Extensives simulation results over
quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels confirm the effectiveness of the DRM-DSTM
coded system, illustrating its advantages over uncoded DRM with proper system
parameters.

### [3] [The Conditional Regret-Capacity Theorem for Batch Universal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10282)
*Marco Bondaschi,Michael Gastpar*

Main category: cs.IT

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用批次训练数据优化预测器的性能，并探索信息度量之间的深层联系。

Method: 推导条件版本的遗憾容量定理，并将其应用于二元无记忆源类，进一步推广到Rényi信息度量。

Result: 揭示了条件Rényi散度与条件Sibson互信息之间的深层联系。

Conclusion: 条件遗憾容量定理为批次数据下的预测提供了理论支持，同时扩展了信息度量的应用范围。

Abstract: We derive a conditional version of the classical regret-capacity theorem.
This result can be used in universal prediction to find lower bounds on the
minimal batch regret, which is a recently introduced generalization of the
average regret, when batches of training data are available to the predictor.
As an example, we apply this result to the class of binary memoryless sources.
Finally, we generalize the theorem to R\'enyi information measures, revealing a
deep connection between the conditional R\'enyi divergence and the conditional
Sibson's mutual information.

### [4] [Energy-Efficient Index and Code Index Modulations for Spread CPM Signals in Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10290)
*Long Yuan,Wenkun Wen,Junlin Liu,Peiran Wu,Minghua Xia*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新型调制方案（IM-CPM-SS和CIM-CPM-SS），结合CPM与SS技术，以解决物联网技术中的低功耗、高效频谱利用等需求，并在下行NOMA系统中验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网技术发展面临四大需求：超低功耗、高频谱效率、低成本实现和大规模连接支持。传统方法难以同时满足这些需求。

Method: 提出两种方案：1) IM-CPM-SS，利用索引调制选择CPM-SS序列；2) CIM-CPM-SS，通过码索引调制将输入比特映射到相位键控符号和序列索引。

Result: 仿真结果显示，两种方案在BER、频谱和能量效率、非线性失真抗性等方面优于传统方法，同时保持了恒包络和连续相位特性。

Conclusion: IM-CPM-SS和CIM-CPM-SS方案在下行NOMA系统中表现出色，为物联网技术提供了高效、低功耗的解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of Internet of Things technologies is driven by four key
demands: ultra-low power consumption, high spectral efficiency, reduced
implementation cost, and support for massive connectivity. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes two novel modulation schemes that integrate
continuous phase modulation (CPM) with spread spectrum (SS) techniques. We
begin by establishing the quasi-orthogonality properties of CPM-SS sequences.
The first scheme, termed IM-CPM-SS, employs index modulation (IM) to select
spreading sequences from the CPM-SS set, thereby improving spectral efficiency
while maintaining the constant-envelope property. The second scheme, referred
to as CIM-CPM-SS, introduces code index modulation (CIM), which partitions the
input bits such that one subset is mapped to phase-shift keying symbols and the
other to CPM-SS sequence indices. Both schemes are applied to downlink
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. We analyze their performance in
terms of bit error rate (BER), spectral and energy efficiency, computational
complexity, and peak-to-average power ratio characteristics under nonlinear
amplifier conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that both schemes
outperform conventional approaches in BER while preserving the benefits of
constant-envelope, continuous-phase signaling. Furthermore, they achieve higher
spectral and energy efficiency and exhibit strong resilience to nonlinear
distortions in downlink NOMA scenarios.

### [5] [Integrated Communication and Remote Sensing in LEO Satellite Systems: Protocol, Architecture and Prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10317)
*Yichao Xu,Xiaoming Chen,Ming Ying,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于正交延迟多普勒分复用（ODDM）信号波形的LEO卫星通信与SAR遥感集成架构，实现了实时SAR成像和信息传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对卫星信道高动态特性和卫星载荷处理能力有限的问题，探索通信与SAR遥感在LEO卫星系统中的集成。

Method: 提出基于ODDM波形的集成架构，设计兼容5G NR标准的传输协议和统一信号处理框架。

Result: 通过分析和仿真验证了系统性能，并开发了SDR原型验证毫米波频段的有效性。

Conclusion: 该集成系统在实时SAR成像和信息传输方面表现出色，适用于卫星直连用户设备场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of communication and synthetic
aperture radar (SAR)-based remote sensing in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite
systems to provide real-time SAR imaging and information transmission.
Considering the high-mobility characteristics of satellite channels and limited
processing capabilities of satellite payloads, we propose an integrated
communication and remote sensing architecture based on an orthogonal
delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) signal waveform. Both communication
and SAR imaging functionalities are achieved with an integrated transceiver
onboard the LEO satellite, utilizing the same waveform and radio frequency (RF)
front-end. Based on such an architecture, we propose a transmission protocol
compatible with the 5G NR standard using downlink pilots for joint channel
estimation and SAR imaging. Furthermore, we design a unified signal processing
framework for the integrated satellite receiver to simultaneously achieve
high-performance channel sensing, low-complexity channel equalization and
interference-free SAR imaging. Finally, the performance of the proposed
integrated system is demonstrated through comprehensive analysis and extensive
simulations in the sub-6 GHz band. Moreover, a software-defined radio (SDR)
prototype is presented to validate its effectiveness for real-time SAR imaging
and information transmission in satellite direct-connect user equipment (UE)
scenarios within the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band.

### [6] [Predictive Position Control for Movable Antenna Arrays in UAV Communications: A Spatio-Temporal Transformer-LSTM Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10720)
*Kan Yu,Kaixuan Li,Xiaowu Liu,Qixun Zhang,Zhiyong Feng*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种预测性MA-UAV协作控制框架，通过最大化保密率和Transformer增强的LSTM网络预测天线位置，解决了MA部署中的速度不匹配问题，显著提升了通信可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市复杂环境中动态障碍和多径效应导致通信链路衰减和覆盖盲区，传统方法难以平衡能效、实时适应性和空间灵活性。MA技术虽有潜力，但面临UAV移动速度与机械重定位延迟不匹配的问题。

Method: 提出预测性MA-UAV协作控制框架：1) 通过保密率最大化确定最优天线位置；2) 使用Transformer增强的LSTM网络预测未来MA位置。

Result: 仿真显示预测精度显著提升（NMSE降低超过49%），通信可靠性优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了MA-UAV协作中的实时优化问题，为城市低空通信提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In complex urban environments, dynamic obstacles and multipath effects lead
to significant link attenuation and pervasive coverage blind spots.
Conventional approaches based on large-scale fixed antenna arrays and UAV
trajectory optimization struggle to balance energy efficiency, real-time
adaptation, and spatial flexibility. The movable antenna (MA) technology has
emerged as a promising solution, offering enhanced spatial flexibility and
reduced energy consumption to overcome the bottlenecks of urban low-altitude
communications. However, MA deployment faces a critical velocity mismatch
between UAV mobility and mechanical repositioning latency, undermining
real-time link optimization and security assurance. To overcome this, we
propose a predictive MA-UAV collaborative control framework. First, optimal
antenna positions are derived via secrecy rate maximization. Second, a
Transformer-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network predicts future MA
positions by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in antenna trajectories.
Extensive simulations demonstrate superior prediction accuracy (NMSE reduction
exceeds 49\%) and communication reliability versus current popular benchmarks.

### [7] [MapLibre Tile: A Next Generation Vector Tile Format](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10791)
*Markus Tremmel,Roland Zink*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MapLibre Tile (MLT)格式，旨在解决Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT)的局限性，提供更高的压缩比和解码速度，并为下一代地图渲染器奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MVT格式已过时，无法满足新型地理空间数据源的需求，因此需要一种更高效的格式。

Method: 提出MLT格式，并通过实验模拟用户会话，比较其与MVT的性能。

Result: MLT在压缩比和解码速度上显著优于MVT，某些情况下性能提升超过六倍。

Conclusion: MLT为下一代地图渲染器提供了基础，有望完全利用GPU处理，突破摩尔定律的限制。

Abstract: The Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) format is widely considered the leading open
standard for large-scale map visualization, as evidenced by its widespread
adoption by major technology companies such as AWS, Meta, and Microsoft for
their products and services. However, MVT was developed nearly a decade ago
and, consequently, does not fully align with the capabilities of new geospatial
data sources that are characterized by rapidly increasing data volumes due to
advancements in geospatial sensors and automated detection through artificial
intelligence. In this paper, we introduce the MapLibre Tile (MLT) format, a
novel vector tile specification designed from the ground up to address the
limitations of MVT. Our experiments, simulating user sessions on widely used
basemap datasets, demonstrate that MLT achieves up to three times better
compression ratios compared to MVT on encoded tilesets, with over six times
better on certain large tiles. Additionally, MLT offers decoding speeds that
are up to three times faster and significantly enhances processing performance.
MLT also introduces new functionalities and is specifically designed to lay the
foundation for the next generation of map renderers, which we expect to
entirely offload processing to the GPU, thereby overcoming the stagnation of
Moore`s law.

### [8] [Comparative Analysis of Attention Mechanisms for Automatic Modulation Classification in Radio Frequency Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09996)
*Ferhat Ozgur Catak,Murat Kuzlu,Umit Cali*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种注意力机制（多头注意力、因果注意力和稀疏注意力）与CNN结合的RF信号分类性能，提出了一种新型CNN-Transformer混合架构，实验结果显示基线注意力准确率最高，但因果和稀疏注意力在计算效率上优势显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索不同注意力机制在无线电信号分类中的性能差异，为实时信号处理应用提供高效解决方案。

Method: 方法包括提出CNN-Transformer混合架构，利用三种注意力机制（多头、因果、稀疏）处理RML2016.10a数据集中的I/Q样本。

Result: 结果显示基线注意力准确率85.05%，因果和稀疏注意力分别减少83%和75%的推理时间，同时保持84%以上的分类性能。

Conclusion: 结论表明不同调制方案对注意力模式有偏好，为实时无线电信号处理的高效注意力机制设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a critical component in
cognitive radio systems and spectrum management applications. This study
presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of three attention mechanisms
(i.e., baseline multi-head attention, causal attention, and sparse attention)
integrated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for radio frequency (RF)
signal classification. It proposes a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture
that leverages different attention patterns to capture temporal dependencies in
I/Q samples from the RML2016.10a dataset. The experimental results demonstrate
that while baseline attention achieves the highest accuracy of 85.05\%, causal
and sparse attention mechanisms offer significant computational advantages with
inference times reduced by 83\% and 75\% respectively, while maintaining
competitive classification performance above 84\%. The analysis reveals
distinct attention pattern preferences across different modulation schemes,
providing insights for designing efficient attention mechanisms for real-time
radio signal processing applications.

### [9] [Information Retention in Iterative Random Projection of Convex Bodies to Lower Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10218)
*Nazanin Mirhosseini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了高维凸体通过随机正交投影降维时的信息保留问题，推导了条件互信息的上界，并探讨了凸体对称性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高维凸体在连续随机正交投影降维过程中信息保留的量化问题，以及凸体对称性对信息保留的影响。

Method: 通过两次随机正交投影将凸体从n维降至n-2维，推导条件互信息的上界，并推广到m次投影的情况。

Result: 推导了条件互信息的上界，并发现凸体的对称性会影响该上界的可达性。

Conclusion: 连续随机正交投影降维过程中，信息保留的上界受凸体对称性影响，为高维数据降维提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a bounded convex body $K_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$
subjected to two successive random orthogonal projections onto
$\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$, respectively. First, we project
$K_0$ orthogonally onto $U_{1}^{\perp}$, the orthogonal complement of
$\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$, where $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$ is uniformly
distributed on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$. This yields a random convex body $K_1
= \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_1}^{\perp}}(K_0) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. We then repeat
the process, projecting $K_1$ orthogonally onto ${U}_{2}^{\perp}$, the
orthogonal complement of $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_2$ chosen uniformly from the
unit sphere in $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_{1}^{\perp}$ or $S^{n-2}$, resulting in a
second random convex body $K_2 = \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_2}^{\perp}}(K_1) \subset
\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$. To quantify information retention through these sequential
dimension reductions, we derive an upper bound for the conditional mutual
information $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$. Furthermore, we extend this process to $m$
iterations and generalize the upper bound on $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$ to establish
an analogous upper bound for $I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$. Finally, we examine the
influence of $K_0$'s symmetry on the achievability of this upper bound for
$I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$.

### [10] [A Deep Learning based Signal Dimension Estimator with Single Snapshot Signal in Phased Array Radar Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10263)
*Yugang Ma,Yonghong Zeng,Sumei Sun,Gary Lee,Ernest Kurniawan,Francois Chin Po Shin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的信号维度估计方法（DLSDE），适用于单次观测的相控阵雷达，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号维度是高分辨率延迟估计和方向查找算法的前提，准确估计信号维度至关重要。

Method: 使用二维卷积神经网络（2D-CNN）自动提取信号维度特征，无需多数据快照。

Result: 在32天线相控阵雷达中，DLSDE将检测信噪比提升>15dB，分辨率提升>1°，适用于空间相关或小角度分离信号。

Conclusion: DLSDE在单次观测下表现优异，解决了现有深度学习方法无法处理单快照信号的问题。

Abstract: Signal dimension, defined here as the number of copies with different delays
or angular shifts, is a prerequisite for many high-resolution delay estimation
and direction-finding algorithms in sensing and communication systems. Thus,
correctly estimating signal dimension itself becomes crucial. In this paper, we
present a deep learning-based signal dimension estimator (DLSDE) with
single-snapshot observation in the example application of phased array radar.
Unlike traditional model-based and existing deep learning-based signal
dimension estimators relying on eigen-decomposition and information criterion,
to which multiple data snapshots would be needed, the proposed DLSDE uses
two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to automatically develop
features corresponding to the dimension of the received signal. Our study shows
that DLSDE significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of the
successful detection rate and resolution. In a phased array radar with 32
antenna elements, DLSDE improves detection Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by >15dB
and resolution by >1{\deg}. This makes the proposed method suitable for
distinguishing multiple signals that are spatially correlated or have small
angular separation. More importantly, our solution operates with a single
snapshot signal, which is incompatible with other existing deep learning-based
methods.

### [11] [Environment Reconstruction in Terahertz Monostatic Sensing: Joint Millimeter-level Geometry Mapping and Material Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10372)
*Zitong Fang,Yejian Lyu,Ziming Yu,Chong Han*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的太赫兹（THz）环境重建框架，结合CCA辅助的多径分量估计与滑动窗口优化策略，实现了毫米级几何映射和可靠材料分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升太赫兹集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统的环境感知能力，实现高精度环境重建。

Method: 采用CCA加速参数提取，结合SAGE算法和滑动窗口优化策略，通过反射损失分析分类信道分量，并利用THz-TDS数据库进行材料识别。

Result: 几何映射平均距离误差为4.9毫米，比文献提升一个数量级；材料分类准确可靠。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了THz ISAC系统的环境感知能力，为高精度通信与感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers high-speed
communication alongside precise environmental sensing. This paper presents a
computationally efficient framework for THz-based environment reconstruction by
integrating connected component analysis (CCA)-assisted multipath component
(MPC) estimation with a sliding-window refinement strategy. To start with, a
monostatic sensing experiment is conducted in an indoor scenario using a vector
network analyzer (VNA)-based sounder operating from 290 to 310 GHz. On one
hand, as for geometry mapping, a CCA-based region search is employed to
accelerate parameter extraction, significantly reducing the search space for
space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)-based estimation
and achieving an 8.4 times acceleration, while preserving resolution. Further
analysis of the connected component structure enables the identification of
indoor features such as flat walls and corners. A sliding-window refinement
applied to the identified regions improves geometric mapping, achieving the
mean distance error of 4.9 mm, which is one order of magnitude better than the
literature. On the other hand, the deterministic and stochastic components of
the monostatic channel are classified through reflection loss analysis. Then,
material identification is performed by looking up the reflection loss in a THz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) database, which comprises over 200 materials
across a 0-6 THz range. Experimental results validate millimeter-level accuracy
in geometry mapping and reliable material classification, enhancing the
environmental awareness capabilities of THz ISAC systems.

Conclusion: 提出的交织收发设计方法在MIMO ISAC系统中实现了高性能，且计算效率高。

Abstract: This paper proposes an interleaved transceiver design method for a
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) system utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms. We consider a continuous transmission system and focus on the design
of the transmission signal and a receiving filter in the time domain for an
interleaved transmission architecture. For communication performance,
constructive interference (CI) is integrated into the optimization problem. For
radar sensing performance, the integrated mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratio (IMSR) of
the beampattern is considered to ensure desirable directivity. Additionally, we
tackle the challenges of inter-block interference and eliminate the spurious
peaks, which are crucial for accurate target detection. Regarding the hardware
implementation aspect, the power of each time sample is constrained to manage
the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The design problem is addressed using
an alternating optimization (AO) framework, with the subproblem for transmitted
waveform design being solved via the successive convex approximation (SCA)
method. To further enhance computational efficiency, the alternate direction
penalty method (ADPM) is employed to solve the subproblems within the SCA
iterations. The convergence of ADPM is established, with convergence of the
case of more than two auxiliary variables being established for the first time.
Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our transceiver design in
achieving desirable performance in both radar sensing and communication, with
the fast algorithm achieving comparable performance with greater computational
efficiency.

### [13] [Second Order Channel Statistics: An Analysis for Optimal Single-user RIS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10476)
*Amy S. Inwood,Peter J. Smith,Philippa A. Martin,Graeme K. Woodward*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了可重构智能表面（RIS）系统中信道状态信息获取的挑战，通过二阶统计方法分析了单用户RIS系统的时空行为，推导了关键性能指标，并通过仿真验证了结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 被动RIS无法生成导频信号或处理数据，导致信道快速变化时难以获取信息，且RIS信道的空间变化影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 假设RIS与基站（BS）之间存在视距（LoS）链路，推导了RIS链路的电平交叉率（LCR）表达式，并提出了全局信道LCR的数值稳定近似方法，进一步分析了平均衰落持续时间（AFD）和时空相关性。

Result: 仿真验证了所有分析结果，表明RIS的使用不会显著放大信道变化。

Conclusion: 通过二阶统计方法，论文为RIS系统的信道行为提供了理论支持，并揭示了关键系统参数的影响。

Abstract: A key challenge facing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is channel
state information acquisition. Passive RISs cannot generate pilot signals or
process data, making rapid temporal changes in the channel problematic.
Additionally, the impact of spatial changes in RIS channels has not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in this work, we use second order
statistics to investigate the spatio-temporal behaviour of a single-user (SU)
RIS system. Assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) RIS to base station (BS) link, we
derive an exact expression for the level crossing rate (LCR) of the RIS link
(user equipment (UE)-RIS-BS path) and propose a numerically stable
approximation for the LCR of the global UE-BS channel. Each LCR expression
attained is then utilised to find the corresponding average fade duration
(AFD). The temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) correlation is also derived
assuming an LoS RIS-BS link. Assuming a Ricean RIS-BS link, expressions for the
spatial correlation matrix of the global channel and the mean SNR loss due to
channel ageing are derived. All of the analyses are verified by simulation, and
the impact of key system parameters is investigated. We show that the use of an
RIS does not significantly amplify changes in the channel.

Abstract: We consider a single-user (SU) continuous fluid antenna system (CFAS)
employing matched filtering (MF) operating over a Ricean fading channel.
Focusing on the upper tail of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
distribution (the high SNR probability (HSP)), we derive accurate
approximations for the HSP in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions using the expected Euler
characteristic (EEC), presenting the first analytical results for a CFAS in a
Ricean environment. In the process, we provide the first closed-form expression
for the Euler characteristic density of a non-central chi-squared random field.
We then examine the impact of the Ricean K-factor on the CFAS performance,
emphasizing the critical role of channel variations in achieving a strong HSP.

Motivation: 研究如何更有效地从雷达散射截面测量数据中提取目标部分的散射截面。

Method: 比较反投影和迭代平滑重加权ℓ1最小化两种方法。

Result: 反投影稳健准确但分辨率有限；迭代方法适用于密集散射体但精度较低。

Conclusion: 反投影适合高精度需求，迭代方法适合密集散射体场景。

Abstract: Radar Cross Section measurement data is often analyzed using Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Radar images. This paper compares backprojection and
iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization as methods to analyze radar
cross section measurements and extract radar cross section for parts of the
measured object. The main conclusion is that using backprojection images to
extract RCS is robust and accurate but is more limited by the resolution than

Abstract: Supervised deep learning methods have shown promise for large-scale channel
estimation (LCE), but their reliance on ground-truth channel labels greatly
limits their practicality in real-world systems. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised learning framework for LCE that does not require ground-truth
channels. The proposed approach leverages Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk
Estimate (GSURE) as a principled unsupervised loss function, which provides an
unbiased estimate of the projected mean-squared error (PMSE) from compressed
noisy measurements. To ensure a guaranteed performance, we integrate a deep
equilibrium (DEQ) model, which implicitly represents an infinite-depth network
by directly learning the fixed point of a parameterized iterative process. We
theoretically prove that, under mild conditions, the proposed GSURE-based
unsupervised DEQ learning can achieve oracle-level supervised performance. In
particular, we show that the DEQ architecture inherently enforces a
compressible solution. We then demonstrate that DEQ-induced compressibility
ensures that optimizing the projected error via GSURE suffices to guarantee a
good MSE performance, enabling a rigorous performance guarantee. Extensive
simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms various baselines when ground-truth channel
is unavailable.

Result: 研究表明，利用折射透镜的色差可以避免使用昂贵的衍射透镜。

Conclusion: 折射透镜在压缩光谱成像系统中具有潜力，可降低成本并简化设计。

Abstract: Earth observation from space is an important scientific and industrial
activity that has applications in many sectors. The instruments employed are
often large, complex, and expensive. In addition, they generate large amounts
of data, which is challenging for storage and transfer purposes. Compressive
spectral imaging would be a cheaper, more efficient, and well-adapted technique
to perform Earth observation. An interesting architecture is compressive
spectral imaging with diffractive lenses, which is extremely compact. This work
investigates the possibility of replacing the diffractive lens in this system
with a classical refractive lens. Taking advantage of the chromatic aberration
of a lens makes the use of expensive diffractive lenses unnecessary.
Simulations are performed to test the feasibility of the method. Signal
recovery is a basis pursuit solved using the Douglas-Rashford algorithm.

Conclusion: 混合PNT方法通过结合多种技术和误差模型，为月球任务提供了高精度和鲁棒性的导航解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) are crucial for upcoming
lunar surface missions. Lunar satellite navigation systems are being developed,
but lack coverage during early deployment phases. Hybrid lunar PNT combining
cooperative navigation, satellite systems, and an optional reference station
offers improved accuracy and availability. This study develops realistic error
models that incorporate temporal correlations often ignored in existing works.
We derive a cooperative navigation error model considering fading and
pseudorange bias from multipath propagation, and compare three error models for
lunar satellite pseudorange and pseudorange rate signal-in-space error. These
temporal error correlation models integrate easily into Kalman filters and
provide realistic performance predictions essential for robust navigation
engines. We perform case studies to demonstrate that hybrid navigation
significantly improves accuracy, particularly with static users present. Most
notably, hybrid navigation enables optimal performance when using a lunar
reference station, achieving sub-meter accuracy with only two visible
satellites.

Result: AFDM-PLIM的频谱效率高于其他AFDM-IM技术，且感知性能更优，尤其在距离估计方面表现突出。

Conclusion: AFDM-PLIM在ISAC系统中具有潜力，因其高效率和优越的感知能力。

Abstract: This study proposes an index modulation (IM) technique for affine frequency
division multiplexing (AFDM) signals and examines its communication and sensing
performance toward integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The
power levels of subcarriers are utilized as modulation indices while also
transmitting data symbols within each subcarrier. Thus, the proposed AFDM with
subcarrier power-level index modulation (AFDM-PLIM) maintains all subcarriers
active at all times to achieve a higher spectral efficiency compared to other
AFDM-IM techniques, where some of the subcarriers are turned off for IM. A low
complexity estimator and subcarrier grouping are also proposed to reduce the
computational complexity of the maximum likelihood estimator. Furthermore, this
study also examines the delay and Doppler ambiguity functions of the proposed
AFDM-PLIM and evaluates its range estimation performance. The results show that
its sensing performance is better than AFDM-IM waveforms due to keeping all
subcarriers active at all times.

Abstract: Objective. Wearable devices with embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) enable
continuous non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity, offering a promising
strategy to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. However,
monitoring during daily life introduces motion artifacts that can compromise
the signals. Traditional signal decomposition techniques often fail with severe
artifacts. Deep learning denoisers are more effective but have poorer
interpretability, which is critical for clinical acceptance. This study
proposes a framework that combines the advantages of both signal decomposition
and deep learning approaches. Approach. We leverage algorithm unfolding to
integrate prior knowledge about the PPG structure into a deep neural network,
improving its interpretability. A learned convolutional sparse coding model
encodes the signal into a sparse representation using a learned dictionary of
kernels that capture recurrent morphological patterns. The network is trained
for denoising using the PulseDB dataset and a synthetic motion artifact model
from the literature. Performance is benchmarked with PPG during daily
activities using the PPG-DaLiA dataset and compared with two reference deep
learning methods. Main results. On the synthetic dataset, the proposed method,
on average, improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7.07 dB to 11.23 dB
and reduced the heart rate mean absolute error (MAE) by 55%. On the PPG-DaLiA
dataset, the MAE decreased by 23%. The proposed method obtained higher SNR and
comparable MAE to the reference methods. Significance. Our method effectively
enhances the quality of PPG signals from wearable devices and enables the
extraction of meaningful waveform features, which may inspire innovative tools
for monitoring cardiovascular diseases.

Conclusion: 流体天线结合新方法在DOA估计中展现出高效性和灵活性，为无线通信提供新思路。

Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA) technology has emerged as a promising approach in wireless
communications due to its capability of providing increased degrees of freedom
(DoFs) and exceptional design flexibility. This paper addresses the challenge
of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for aligned received signals (ARS) and
non-aligned received signals (NARS) by designing two specialized uniform FA
structures under time-constrained mobility. For ARS scenarios, we propose a
fully movable antenna configuration that maximizes the virtual array aperture,
whereas for NARS scenarios, we design a structure incorporating a fixed
reference antenna to reliably extract phase information from the signal
covariance. To overcome the limitations of large virtual arrays and limited
sample data inherent in time-varying channels (TVC), we introduce two novel DOA
estimation methods: TMRLS-MUSIC for ARS, combining Toeplitz matrix
reconstruction (TMR) with linear shrinkage (LS) estimation, and TMR-MUSIC for
NARS, utilizing sub-covariance matrices to construct virtual array responses.
Both methods employ Nystrom approximation to significantly reduce computational
complexity while maintaining estimation accuracy. Theoretical analyses and
extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
underdetermined DOA estimation using minimal FA elements, outperform
conventional methods in estimation accuracy, and substantially reduce
computational complexity.

Abstract: This paper investigates a design framework for sparse fluid antenna systems
(FAS) enabling high-performance direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation,
particularly in challenging millimeter-wave (mmWave) environments. By
ingeniously harnessing the mobility of fluid antenna (FA) elements, the
proposed architectures achieve an extended range of spatial degrees of freedom
(DoF) compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays. This
innovation not only facilitates the seamless application of super-resolution
DOA estimators but also enables robust DOA estimation, accurately localizing
more sources than the number of physical antenna elements. We introduce two
bespoke FA array structures and mobility strategies tailored to scenarios with
aligned and misaligned received signals, respectively, demonstrating a
hardware-driven approach to overcoming complexities typically addressed by
intricate algorithms. A key contribution is a light-of-sight (LoS)-centric,
closed-form DOA estimator, which first employs an eigenvalue-ratio test for
precise LoS path number detection, followed by a polynomial root-finding
procedure. This method distinctly showcases the unique advantages of FAS by
simplifying the estimation process while enhancing accuracy. Numerical results
compellingly verify that the proposed FA array designs and estimation
techniques yield an extended DoF range, deliver superior DOA accuracy, and
maintain robustness across diverse signal conditions.

Abstract: Most existing antenna array-based source localization methods rely on
fixed-position arrays (FPAs) and strict assumptions about source field
conditions (near-field or far-field), which limits their effectiveness in
complex, dynamic real-world scenarios where high-precision localization is
required. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel scalable fluid antenna
system (SFAS) that can dynamically adjust its aperture configuration to
optimize performance for different localization tasks. Within this framework,
we develop a two-stage source localization strategy based on the exact spatial
geometry (ESG) model: the first stage uses a compact aperture configuration for
initial direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, while the second stage employs
an expanded aperture for enhanced DOA and range estimation. The proposed
approach eliminates the traditional need for signal separation or isolation to
classify source types and enables a single SFAS array to achieve high
localization accuracy without field-specific assumptions, model
simplifications, or approximations, representing a new paradigm in array-based
source localization. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method in terms of localization accuracy, computational efficiency,
and robustness to different source types.

Abstract: Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the
first MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by existing
sensor technologies such as metal-oxide semi-conductor (MOS) sensors. However,
commercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive
behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly
molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this
gap, we propose a detector for molecule mixture communication with a general
non-linear, cross-reactive receiver (RX) array that performs approximate
maximum likelihood detection on the sensor outputs. Additionally, we introduce
an algorithm for the design of mixture alphabets that accounts for the RX
characteristics. We evaluate our detector and alphabet design algorithm through
simulations that are based on measurements reported for two commercial MOS
sensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves
similar symbol error rates as data-driven methods without requiring large
numbers of training samples and that the alphabet design algorithm outperforms
methods that do not account for the RX characteristics. Since the proposed
detector and alphabet design algorithm are also applicable to other chemical
sensors, they pave the way for reliable air-based MC.
