This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  possible publication", "summary": "A common assumption in signal processing is that underlying data numerically\nconforms to a Gaussian distribution. It is commonly utilized in signal\nprocessing to describe unknown additive noise in a system and is often\njustified by citing the central limit theorem for sums of random variables,\nalthough the central limit theorem applies only to sums of independent\nidentically distributed random variables. However, many linear operations in\nsignal processing take the form of weighted sums, which transforms the random\nvariables such that their distributions are no longer identical. One such\noperation is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. FIR filters are commonly\nused in signal processing applications as a pre-processing step. FIR output\nnoise is generally assumed to be Gaussian. This article examines the FIR output\nresponse in the presence of uniformly distributed quantization noise. We\nexpress the FIR output uncertainty in terms of the input quantization\nuncertainty and filter coefficients. We show that the output uncertainty cannot\nbe assumed to be Gaussian, but depending on the application a Gaussian\nestimation may still be useful. Then, we show through detailed numerical\nsimulations that the output uncertainty distribution of the filter can be\nestimated through its most dominant coefficients."}

Traditional\nwireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the\nstringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,\nand privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel\nintegrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In\nthe proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions\nand monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.\nInstead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and\ncommunicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This\nsemantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical\nrelevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the\ntransmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the\nrobot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track\npatient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and\nreliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming\nmatrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and\npower budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic\nsecrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC\nframework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission\nefficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint\nsensing and communication methods."}

Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF)\nlower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can\ndeal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect\nchannel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address\nlimitations of UatF-based algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the\nUatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme\ncases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels,\nthe UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale\ninvariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically,\nespecially when simple beamforming strategies are employed. In contrast, our\nframework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer\nfrom the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min\npower control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous\nCSI at the decoder."}

To address this issue, we propose to\nintegrate antenna element self-calibration into a variational sparse Bayesian\nlearning (VSBL) algorithm for parametric channel estimation. We model antenna\ngain and phase deviations as latent variables and derive explicit update\nequations to jointly infer these calibration parameters and the channel\nparameters: the model order, complex amplitudes, delays, angles, and the noise\nvariance. The resulting algorithm operates online and adapts in real time to\nhardware-induced mismatches. We assess its performance in terms of the root\nmean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric,\ndemonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without\ncalibration.
