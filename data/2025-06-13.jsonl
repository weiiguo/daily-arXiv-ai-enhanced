The\ntransmission of a source through a channel can be accomplished either by\nseparate or joint source-channel coding (SSCC or JSCC).

Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and\nreliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents\nand increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this\ncontext is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the\nreliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter\nvariations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may\naffect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In\nthis work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel\nimbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean\nsquares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to\nestimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected\ntargets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior\nknowledge on the angular parameters of the targets.

Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these\ncodes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a\nfundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment\nin communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural\npolar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off\nby simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER\ncharacteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough\nthrough three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture\nthat leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex\ndependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly\noptimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an\nadaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code\n(DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for\nrobust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code\nconfiguration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and\nBLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and\nDeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved\narchitecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further\namplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error\nrate metrics over existing approaches. DeepPolar+ effectively bridges the gap\nbetween theoretical potential and practical implementation of neural polar\ncodes, offering a viable path forward for next-generation error correction\nsystems."}

The architecture incorporates a single or multiple\nradio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase\nprofiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller\nencompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and\nconsequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel\nchannel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal\ntraining pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable\nabsorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its\nsignal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly\nused by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase\nconfiguration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation\nalgorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the\nentire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank\nproperties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for\ncommunication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical\ninvestigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation\ntechnique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware\nconfiguration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel\nestimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized\nreflection coefficients of its unit elements."}
