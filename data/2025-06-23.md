Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has been identified as a new
disruptive technology for future wireless systems to support a large number of
users with only a few antennas. However, the intricate relationships between
the signal carrier wavelength and the transceiver region size lead to
inaccuracies in traditional far-field 6DMA channel model, causing discrepancies
between the model predictions and the hybrid-field channel characteristics in
practical 6DMA systems, where users might be in the far-field region relative
to the antennas on the same 6DMA surface, while simultaneously being in the
near-field region relative to different 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, due to the
high-dimensional channel and the coupled position and rotation constraints, the
estimation of the 6DMA channel and the joint design of the 6DMA positions and
rotations and the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) incur extremely
high computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose an efficient
hybrid-field generalized 6DMA channel model, which accounts for planar-wave
propagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical-wave propagation
among different 6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, by leveraging directional sparsity,
we propose a low-overhead channel estimation algorithm that efficiently
constructs a complete channel map for all potential antenna position-rotation
pairs while limiting the training overhead incurred by antenna movement. In
addition, we propose a low-complexity design leveraging deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), which facilitates the joint design of the 6DMA positions,
rotations, and beamforming in a unified manner. Numerical results demonstrate
that the proposed hybrid-field channel model and channel estimation algorithm
outperform existing approaches and that the DRL-enhanced 6DMA system
significantly surpasses flexible antenna systems.

### [2] [Code Rate Optimization via Neural Polar Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15836)
*Ziv Aharoni,Bashar Huleihel,Henry D Pfister,Haim H Permuter*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种通过神经极化解码器（NPDs）优化通信码率的方法，适用于未知信道模型的情况，通过两阶段训练和推理优化输入分布，实验证明在非均匀输入分布下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在未知信道模型的情况下，如何优化通信码率并实现高效编码是研究的核心动机。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：训练阶段通过NPDs估计互信息并优化输入分布参数；推理阶段利用优化模型构建极化码，结合HY方案和列表解码提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际通信系统提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，连接了理论容量估计与实际编码性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to optimize communication code rates via the
application of neural polar decoders (NPDs). Employing this approach enables
simultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while
providing a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The
proposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,
treating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input
samples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to
estimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and
optimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves
a two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training
phase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step
estimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the
improvement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI
estimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is
used to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto
(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding
to enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and
finite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
particularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution
is non-uniform. For these cases, we show significant improvements in MI and bit
error rates (BERs) over those achieved by uniform and independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) input distributions, validating our method for
block lengths up to 1024. This scalable approach has potential applications in
real-world communication systems, bridging theoretical capacity estimation and
practical coding performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能量收集在无线系统中具有吸引力，但如何在同时涉及数据缓冲和能量存储的中继网络中实现全分集阶是一个挑战。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel relay selection scheme for buffer-aided wireless
networks with relays equipped with both data buffers and energy storage. While
buffer-aided relay networks have demonstrated significantly improved
performance, energy harvesting has become an attractive solution in many
wireless systems, garnering considerable attention when applied to buffer-aided
relay networks. It is known that state-dependent selection rules must be used
to achieve full diversity order in buffer-aided relay networks, requiring link
priorities for data transmission to be set based on system states. This task
becomes challenging when both data buffers and energy storage are involved. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method for setting link priorities, which
forms the basis for a new selection rule. The outage probability of the
proposed selection scheme is derived. The simulation results demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed algorithm which achieves full diversity in
buffer-aided relay selection with energy storage, and consistently outperforms
baseline approaches across various metrics.

### [4] [Information-computation trade-offs in non-linear transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15948)
*Connor Ding,Abhiram Rao Gorle,Jiwon Jeong,Naomi Sagan,Tsachy Weissman*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了非线性变换在信息处理和压缩中的关键作用，分析了INR和GS两种框架的特性，提出了文本变换和LZ78变换，揭示了编码效率与计算成本之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非线性变换在压缩任务中的表现，探索其在现代信息处理任务中的潜力，如分类、去噪和生成AI。

Method: 分析了INR和GS的表示特性、压缩行为和收敛动态；提出了文本变换和LZ78变换，并验证其效果。

Result: INR和GS各有优劣；文本变换在超低比特率下高效且提升感知质量；LZ78变换保留了算法的通用性。

Conclusion: 非线性变换在压缩和其他任务中具有潜力，为平衡资源与性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the interplay between information and computation in
non-linear transform-based compression for broad classes of modern
information-processing tasks. We first investigate two emerging nonlinear data
transformation frameworks for image compression: Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs) and 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS). We analyze their
representational properties, behavior under lossy compression, and convergence
dynamics. Our results highlight key trade-offs between INR's compact,
resolution-flexible neural field representations and GS's highly
parallelizable, spatially interpretable fitting, providing insights for future
hybrid and compression-aware frameworks. Next, we introduce the textual
transform that enables efficient compression at ultra-low bitrate regimes and
simultaneously enhances human perceptual satisfaction. When combined with the
concept of denoising via lossy compression, the textual transform becomes a
powerful tool for denoising tasks. Finally, we present a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78)
"transform", a universal method that, when applied to any member of a broad
compressor family, produces new compressors that retain the asymptotic
universality guarantees of the LZ78 algorithm. Collectively, these three
transforms illuminate the fundamental trade-offs between coding efficiency and
computational cost. We discuss how these insights extend beyond compression to
tasks such as classification, denoising, and generative AI, suggesting new
pathways for using non-linear transformations to balance resource constraints
and performance.

### [5] [End-to-End Learning of Probabilistic Constellation Shaping through Importance Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16098)
*Shrinivas Chimmalgi,Laurent Schmalen,Vahid Aref*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自动微分和重要性采样的新型损失函数，用于自动编码器学习概率星座成形，解决了传统方法中梯度计算易出错的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，手动计算梯度项容易出错，限制了概率星座成形在编码调制系统中的优化效果。

Method: 采用自动微分和重要性采样的新型损失函数，优化星座点概率，确保使用精确梯度。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在高斯白噪声信道和简化强度调制直接检测信道模型中的性能与现有方法一致。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简化了梯度计算，提升了概率星座成形的优化效率和准确性。

Abstract: Probabilistic constellation shaping enables easy rate adaption and has been
proven to reduce the gap to Shannon capacity. Constellation point probabilities
are optimized to maximize either the mutual information or the bit-wise mutual
information. The optimization problem is however challenging even for simple
channel models. While autoencoder-based machine learning has been applied
successfully to solve this problem [1], it requires manual computation of
additional terms for the gradient which is an error-prone task. In this work,
we present novel loss functions for autoencoder-based learning of probabilistic
constellation shaping for coded modulation systems using automatic
differentiation and importance sampling. We show analytically that our proposed
approach also uses exact gradients of the constellation point probabilities for
the optimization. In simulations, our results closely match the results from
[1] for the additive white Gaussian noise channel and a simplified model of the
intensity-modulation direct-detection channel.

### [6] [All Kolmogorov complexity functions are optimal, but are some more optimal?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16180)
*Bruno Bauwens,Alexander Kozachinskiy,Alexander Shen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文讨论了自1965年以来关于Kolmogorov复杂度定义中编程语言选择的不同建议，特别是更强的通用性要求，并证明在许多情况下这不会改变复杂度函数的集合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过选择特定的编程语言或添加其他要求来优化Kolmogorov复杂度的定义。

Method: 分析不同建议，特别是更强的通用性要求，并比较其对复杂度函数的影响。

Result: 证明在许多情况下，更强的通用性要求不会改变复杂度函数的集合。

Conclusion: 尽管有更强的通用性要求，但复杂度函数的集合通常保持不变，表明这些额外要求可能并不必要。

Abstract: Kolmogorov (1965) defined the complexity of a string $x$ as the minimal
length of a program generating $x$. Obviously this definition depends on the
choice of the programming language. Kolmogorov noted that there exist
\emph{optimal} programming languages that make the complexity function minimal
up to $O(1)$ additive terms, and we should take one of them -- but which one?
  Is there a chance to agree on some specific programming language in this
definition? Or at least should we add some other requirements to optimality?
What can we achieve in this way?
  In this paper we discuss different suggestions of this type that appeared
since 1965, specifically a stronger requirement of universality (and show that
in many cases this does not change the set of complexity functions).

### [7] [Data Compression with Relative Entropy Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16309)
*Gergely Flamich*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 研究证明了相对熵编码的理论最优性，并展示了其在图像、音频、视频和蛋白质数据压缩中的高效性能。

Conclusion: 相对熵编码为现代机器学习压缩提供了强大的理论基础和实用工具，尤其在隐私保护和感知质量方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Over the last few years, machine learning unlocked previously infeasible
features for compression, such as providing guarantees for users' privacy or
tailoring compression to specific data statistics (e.g., satellite images or
audio recordings of animals) or users' audiovisual perception. This, in turn,
has led to an explosion of theoretical investigations and insights that aim to
develop new fundamental theories, methods and algorithms better suited for
machine learning-based compressors.
  In this thesis, I contribute to this trend by investigating relative entropy
coding, a mathematical framework that generalises classical source coding
theory. Concretely, relative entropy coding deals with the efficient
communication of uncertain or randomised information. One of its key advantages
is that it extends compression methods to continuous spaces and can thus be
integrated more seamlessly into modern machine learning pipelines than
classical quantisation-based approaches. Furthermore, it is a natural
foundation for developing advanced compression methods that are
privacy-preserving or account for the perceptual quality of the reconstructed
data.
  The thesis considers relative entropy coding at three conceptual levels:
After introducing the basics of the framework, (1) I prove results that provide
new, maximally tight fundamental limits to the communication and computational
efficiency of relative entropy coding; (2) I use the theory of Poisson point
processes to develop and analyse new relative entropy coding algorithms, whose
performance attains the theoretic optima and (3) I showcase the strong
practical performance of relative entropy coding by applying it to image,
audio, video and protein data compression using small, energy-efficient,
probabilistic neural networks called Bayesian implicit neural representations.

### [8] [Covert Communication over Physically-Degraded Alarm Two-Way Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16581)
*Tuna Erdoğan,Tyler Kann,Aria Nosratinia,Matthieu Bloch*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 研究了二进制输入离散无记忆警报双向信道上的隐蔽通信，展示了合作如何严格提升隐蔽通信吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在双向信道中隐蔽通信的可能性，特别是在存在窃听者的情况下，如何通过合作避免触发警报并提升通信效率。

Method: 通过公开时间共享表征双向信道的隐蔽容量区域，设计辅助随机变量以应对多用户隐蔽通信中的平方根定律。

Result: 合作显著提高了隐蔽通信的吞吐量，且协调避免触发警报的代价在渐近意义上是“免费”的。

Conclusion: 合作在隐蔽通信中具有重要作用，特别是在警报双向信道中，通过适当设计辅助随机变量可以实现高效隐蔽通信。

Abstract: We study covert communications over binary-input discrete memoryless alarm
two-way channels, in which two users interact through a two-way channel and
attempt to hide the presence of their communication from an eavesdropping
receiver. The alarm two-way channel is one in which simultaneous transmissions
by both users trigger an alarm at the eavesdropper, which captures the
challenges and opportunities of cooperation beyond interference management. In
particular, by characterizing the covert capacity region of two-way channels
when using public time sharing, we show how cooperation strictly improves
achievable covert communication throughputs. While our analysis falls short of
characterizing the two-way covert capacity region for all two-way channels, we
provide general achievable and converse bounds that illuminate the cooperation
mechanisms that benefit covertness and are tight for a physically-degraded
alarm two-way channels. Because of the unique nature of covert communications,
our analysis also shows that the coordination required to avoid triggering
alarms comes asymptotically "for free". The key technical challenge that we
address is how to appropriately design auxiliary random variables in a
multi-user covert communication setting subject to the square root law.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了采用线性码的分布式存储系统的服务速率区域（SRR），推导了数据对象最大请求速率的上界和下界，并验证了这些界限的紧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索分布式存储系统中线性码的服务速率区域，以优化系统吞吐量和可扩展性。

Method: 通过分析线性码的奇偶校验方程和码参数，推导了请求速率的上界和下界，并验证了这些界限在非系统码和系统码中的紧性。

Result: 证明了非系统码的界限是紧的，系统码的上界在特定条件下达到。以二进制汉明码为例，确定了其精确需求限制。

Conclusion: 通过组合设计理论，为SRR问题提供了新的解决视角。

Abstract: We investigate the service-rate region (SRR) of distributed storage systems
that employ linear codes. We focus on systems where each server stores one code
symbol, and a user recovers a data symbol by accessing any of its recovery
groups, subject to per-server capacity limits. The SRR--the convex polytope of
simultaneously achievable request rates--captures system throughput and
scalability. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum request rate
of each data object. These bounds hold for all linear codes and depend only on
the number of parity checks orthogonal to a particular set of codeword
coordinates associated with that object, i.e., the equations used in
majority-logic decoding, and on code parameters. We then check the bound
saturation for 1) all non-systematic codes whose SRRs are already known and 2)
systematic codes. For the former, we prove the bounds are tight. For systematic
codes, we show that the upper bound is achieved whenever the supports of
minimum-weight dual codewords form a 2-design. As an application, we determine
the exact per-object demand limits for binary Hamming codes. Our framework
provides a new lens to address the SRR problem through combinatorial design
theory.

### [10] [Neural Polar Decoders for DNA Data Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17076)
*Ziv Aharoni,Henry D. Pfister*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经极化解码器（NPD）的低复杂度解码方法，用于解决DNA数据存储中的同步错误问题，性能接近最优且复杂度显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA数据存储中的同步错误（插入、删除和替换）是主要挑战，传统最大似然解码器计算成本高，需要一种低复杂度的解决方案。

Method: 采用数据驱动的神经极化解码器（NPD），仅需样本访问通道，无需显式通道模型，复杂度为O(AN log N)。

Result: NPD在合成删除和IDS通道上表现优异，接近最优解码性能，且复杂度低于基于网格的解码器。在真实DNA存储场景中，NPD性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NPD为DNA数据存储系统提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解码方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Synchronization errors, such as insertions and deletions, present a
fundamental challenge in DNA-based data storage systems, arising from both
synthesis and sequencing noise. These channels are often modeled as
insertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channels, for which designing
maximum-likelihood decoders is computationally expensive. In this work, we
propose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design
low-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed
architecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN
log N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs
require only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an
explicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI)
estimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS
channels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal
decoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower
complexity than trellis-based decoders. We also provide numerical estimates of
the channel capacity for the deletion channel. We extend our evaluation to
realistic DNA storage settings, including channels with multiple noisy reads
and real-world Nanopore sequencing data. Our results show that NPDs match or
surpass the performance of existing methods while using significantly fewer
parameters than the state-of-the-art. These findings highlight the promise of
NPDs for robust and efficient decoding in DNA data storage systems.

*Sibo Zhang,Bruno Clerckx,David Vargas*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的下行链路RSMA架构CS-RSMA，通过直接编码用户消息并分割码字，优化了性能和实现复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RSMA在编码前分割用户消息为公共和私有部分，存在性能限制和实现复杂度问题。

Method: CS-RSMA直接编码用户消息后分割码字，并提出新的性能分析框架和预编码优化方法。

Result: CS-RSMA在总速率（SR）上优于传统RSMA，在最大最小公平性（MMF）上表现相似。

Conclusion: CS-RSMA在性能和实现复杂度上均有显著优势，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising
multiple access technique. We propose a novel architecture for downlink RSMA,
namely Codeword-Segmentation RSMA (CS-RSMA). Different from conventional RSMA
which splits users' messages into common and private parts before encoding,
CS-RSMA encodes the users' messages directly, segments the codewords into
common and private parts, and transmits the codeword segments using common and
private streams. In addition to the principle of CS-RSMA, a novel performance
analysis framework is proposed. This framework utilizes a recent discovery in
mismatched decoding under finite-alphabet input and interference, and can
better capture the receiver's complexity limits. Precoder optimization under
finite alphabets and suboptimal decoders for conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA to
maximize the Sum-Rate (SR) and the Max-Min Fairness (MMF) is also addressed.
The numerical results reveal the theoretical performance of conventional RSMA
and CS-RSMA. We observe that CS-RSMA leads to better performance than
conventional RSMA in SR, and similar performance in MMF. Furthermore, a
physical-layer implementation of CS-RSMA is proposed and evaluated through
link-level simulations. Aside performance benefits, we also demonstrate that
CS-RSMA brings significant benefits on the encoding/decoding, control
signaling, and retransmission process compared to conventional RSMA.

### [12] [Optimized cerebral blood flow measurement in speckle contrast optical spectroscopy via refinement of noise calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15843)
*Ninghe Liu,Yu Xi Huang,Simon Mahler,Changhuei Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于优化的自适应噪声校准框架，用于提高SCOS中CBF测量的准确性，特别是在低信号水平下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCOS在监测CBF时存在噪声校准误差，导致测量精度下降，尤其是在低信号水平下。

Method: 采用优化框架自适应细化噪声校准，减少CBF-CBV波形相关性。

Result: 在10名受试者中验证，将可靠CBF信号阈值从97降至26电子/像素。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了SCOS在低信号和大SD距离下的CBF测量准确性。

Abstract: Speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) offers a non-invasive and
cost-effective method for monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF). However,
extracting accurate CBF from SCOS necessitates precise noise pre-calibration.
Errors from this can degrade CBF measurement fidelity, particularly when the
overall signal level is low. Such errors primarily stem from residual speckle
contrast associated with camera and shot noise, whose fluctuations exhibit a
temporal structure that mimics cerebral blood volume (CBV) waveforms. We
propose an optimization-based framework that performs an adaptive refinement of
noise calibration, mitigating the CBV-mimicking artifacts by reducing the
CBF-CBV waveform correlation. Validated on 10 human subjects, our approach
effectively lowered the signal threshold for reliable CBF signal from 97 to 26
electrons per pixel for a 1920x1200 pixels SCOS system. This improvement
enables more accurate and robust CBF measurements in SCOS, especially at large
source-detector (SD) distances for deeper tissue interrogation.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于噪声感知的数字调制方法（ChannelComp框架），用于无线多址信道中的函数计算，解决了模拟方法的噪声敏感性和数字方法的设计复杂性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线多址信道（MACs）的物理叠加特性可用于函数计算，但现有模拟方法对噪声敏感，数字方法设计复杂且频谱效率不足。

Method: 提出噪声感知的星座设计方法，将编码器设计转化为基于噪声分布的最大-最小优化问题，支持高斯、拉普拉斯和重尾噪声模型。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在噪声MACs上的均方误差显著低于现有数字OAC方法。

Conclusion: ChannelComp框架通过噪声感知设计和量化采样方案，提升了数字OAC的可扩展性和计算精度。

Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) leverages the physical superposition property
of wireless multiple access channels (MACs) to compute functions while
communication occurs, enabling scalable and low-latency processing in
distributed networks. While analog OAC methods suffer from noise sensitivity
and hardware constraints, existing digital approaches are often limited in
design complexity, which may hinder scalability and fail to exploit spectral
efficiency fully. This two-part paper revisits and extends the ChannelComp
framework, a general methodology for computing arbitrary finite-valued
functions using digital modulation. In Part I, we develop a novel constellation
design approach that is aware of the noise distribution and formulates the
encoder design as a max-min optimization problem using noise-tailored distance
metrics. Our design supports noise models, including Gaussian, Laplace, and
heavy-tailed distributions. We further demonstrate that, for heavy-tailed
noise, the optimal ChannelComp setup coincides with the solution to the
corresponding max-min criterion for the channel noise with heavy-tailed
distributions. Numerical experiments confirm that our noise-aware design
achieves a substantially lower mean-square error than leading digital OAC
methods over noisy MACs. In Part II, we consider a constellation design with a
quantization-based sampling scheme to enhance modulation scalability and
computational accuracy for large-scale digital OAC.

Abstract: With the increase of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) array size and
carrier frequency, near-field MIMO communications will become crucial in 6G
wireless networks. Due to the increase of MIMO near-field range, the research
of near-field MIMO capacity has aroused wide interest. In this paper, we focus
on the theoretical analysis and empirical study of near-field MIMO capacity.
First, the near-field channel model is characterized from the electromagnetic
information perspective. Second, with the uniform planar array (UPA), the
channel capacity based on effective degree of freedom (EDoF) is analyzed
theoretically, and the closed-form analytical expressions are derived in
detail. Finally, based on the numerical verification of near-field channel
measurement experiment at 13 GHz band, we reveal that the channel capacity of
UPA-type MIMO systems decreases continuously with the communication distance
increasing. It can be observed that the near-field channel capacity gain is
relatively obvious when large-scale MIMO is adopted at both receiving and
transmitter ends, but the near-field channel capacity gain may be limited in
the actual communication system with the small antenna array at receiving end.
This work will give some reference to the near-field communication systems.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is one of the key enabling
technologies in future sixth-generation (6G) networks. Current ISAC systems
predominantly rely on deterministic pilot signals within the signal frame to
accomplish sensing tasks. However, these pilot signals typically occupy only a
small portion, e.g., 0.15% to 25%, of the time-frequency resources. To enhance
the system utility, a promising solution is to repurpose the extensive random
data payload signals for sensing tasks. In this paper, we analyze the ISAC
performance of a multi-antenna system where both deterministic pilot and random
data symbols are employed for sensing tasks. By capitalizing on random matrix
theory (RMT), we first derive a semi-closed-form asymptotic expression of the
ergodic linear minimum mean square error (ELMMSE). Then, we formulate an ISAC
precoding optimization problem to minimize the ELMMSE, which is solved via a
specifically tailored successive convex approximation (SAC) algorithm. To
provide system insights, we further derive a closed-form expression for the
asymptotic ELMMSE at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our analysis reveals
that, compared with conventional sensing implemented by deterministic signals,
the sensing performance degradation induced by random signals is critically
determined by the ratio of the transmit antenna size to the data symbol length.
Based on this result, the ISAC precoding optimization problem at high SNRs is
transformed into a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved.
Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived asymptotic expressions
of ELMMSE and the performance of the proposed precoding schemes. Particularly,
by leveraging data payload signals for sensing tasks, the sensing error is
reduced by up to 5.6 dB compared to conventional pilot-based sensing.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key feature for
sixth-generation (6G) networks, providing an opportunity to meet the dual
demands of communication and sensing. Existing ISAC research primarily focuses
on baseband optimization at individual access points, with limited attention to
the roles of electromagnetic (EM) shaping and network-wide coordination. The
intricate interdependencies between these domains remain insufficiently
explored, leaving their full potential for enhancing ISAC performance largely
untapped. To bridge this gap, we consider multi-domain ISAC optimization
integrating EM shaping, baseband processing, and network cooperation strategies
that facilitate efficient resource management and system-level design. We
analyze the fundamental trade-offs between these domains and offer insights
into domain-specific and cross-domain strategies contributing to ISAC
performance and efficiency. We then conduct a case study demonstrating the
effectiveness of joint multi-domain optimization. Finally, we discuss key
challenges and future research directions to connect theoretical advancements
and practical ISAC deployments. This work paves the way for intelligent and
scalable ISAC architectures, providing critical insights for their seamless
integration into next-generation wireless networks.

Motivation: 解决多组多播通信在PASS系统中的设计问题，以最大化多播速率。

Method: 1) WD架构采用逐元素顺序优化策略和LSE-PGD算法；2) WM架构基于MM框架，结合低复杂度优化方法和拉格朗日对偶性。

Result: WD和WM在PASS中显著提升多播速率，WM在密集部署中更稳健，WD在用户组空间分离时表现更优。

Conclusion: PASS系统在多组多播通信中具有显著优势，WD和WM架构各有适用场景。

Abstract: This article addresses the design of multigroup multicast communications in
the pinching-antenna system (PASS). A PASS-enabled multigroup transmission
framework is proposed to maximize multicast rates under a couple of
transmission architectures: waveguide-division (WD) and waveguide-multiplexing
(WM). 1) For WD, an element-wise sequential optimization strategy is proposed
for pinching beamforming, i.e., optimizing the activated positions of pinching
antennas along dielectric waveguides. Meanwhile, a log-sum-exp projected
gradient descent algorithm is proposed for transmit power allocation across
waveguides. 2) For WM, a majorization-minimization (MM)-based framework is
proposed to tackle the problem's non-smoothness and non-convexity. On this
basis, a low-complexity element-wise sequential optimization method is
developed for pinching beamforming using the MM surrogate objective.
Furthermore, the optimal transmit beamformer structure is derived from the MM
surrogate objective using the Lagrange duality, with an efficient transmit
beamforming algorithm proposed using projected adaptive gradient descent.
Numerical results demonstrate that: i) both WD and WM architectures in PASS
achieve significant multicast rate improvements over conventional MIMO
techniques, especially for systems with large service areas; ii) WM is more
robust than WD in dense deployments, while WD excels when user groups are
spatially separated.

Conclusion: DCFNet-LR是一种高效且兼容现有帧结构的ISAC解决方案，显著提升了感知性能。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a headline feature for the
forthcoming IMT-2030 and 6G releases, yet a concrete solution that fits within
the established orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) family
remains open. Specifically, Doppler-induced inter-carrier interference (ICI)
destroys sub-carrier orthogonality of OFDM sensing signals, blurring
range-velocity maps and severely degrading sensing accuracy. Building on
multi-user multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) OFDM systems, this paper proposes
Doppler-Correction Filter Network (DCFNet), an AI-native ISAC model that
delivers fine range-velocity resolution at minimal complexity without altering
the legacy frame structure. A bank of DCFs first shifts dominant ICI energy
away from critical Doppler bins; a compact deep learning network then
suppresses the ICI. To further enhance the range and velocity resolutions, we
propose DCFNet with local refinement (DCFNet-LR), which applies a generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to refine target estimates of DCFNet to sub-cell
accuracy. Simulation results show that DCFNet-LR runs $143\times$ faster than
maximum likelihood search and achieves significantly superior performance,
reducing the range RMSE by up to $2.7 \times 10^{-4}$ times and the velocity
RMSE by $6.7 \times 10^{-4}$ times compared to conventional detection methods.

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is gaining significant attention from academia
and industry. Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications
in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field
beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles,
while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency.
However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such
as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of
distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language
models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to

Conclusion: MASC为6G时代的非地面网络提供了集成感知与通信的可行方案，平衡了环境感知与高可靠性数据传输。

Abstract: Mars exploration missions increasingly demand reliable communication systems,
yet harsh environmental conditions -- particularly frequent dust storms,
extreme Doppler effects, and stringent resource constraints -- pose
unprecedented challenges to conventional communication approaches. This paper
presents the Martian Adaptive Sensing and Communication (MASC) system
specifically designed for the Martian environment. MASC establishes a
physically interpretable channel model and develops three key components:
environment-aware hybrid precoding, adaptive parameter mapping, and robust
communication precoding. Simulation results demonstrate that MASC maintains 45
percent sensing coverage under severe dust conditions compared to only 5
percent with conventional methods, provides up to 2.5 dB
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) improvement at 50 percent
channel state information (CSI) uncertainty, and yields 80 percent higher
capacity in moderate dust storms. Using an epsilon-constraint multi-objective
optimization approach, we enable mission planners to select operational modes
ranging from communication-priority (0.33 bps/Hz capacity, 28 percent sensing
coverage) to sensing-priority (90 percent coverage with minimal capacity),
offering a versatile framework that balances environmental awareness with
hyper-reliable data transmission. This work provides a validated blueprint for
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in non-terrestrial networks (NTN),
a key enabler for achieving ubiquitous connectivity in the 6G era.

Motivation: 解决传统方法假设观测独立同分布（i.i.d.）的局限性，针对异常状态随时间演化的场景，提出更贴合实际的隐马尔可夫模型框架。

Method: 设计ADHM算法，通过动态调整探测策略，利用统计证据和隐状态预测更新，优化资源分配以聚焦最具信息量的进程。

Result: 理论分析表明ADHM在已知隐状态分布下接近检测极限，仿真实验显示其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ADHM算法有效利用时间相关性，显著提升异常检测效率，适用于动态演化的异常场景。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting an anomalous process among a large number
of processes. At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal
state), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state)
or state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition
between states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over
time. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of
processes. Each probed process generates an observation depending on its hidden
state, either a typical distribution under state zero or an abnormal
distribution under state one. The objective is to design a sequential search
strategy that minimizes the expected detection time, subject to an error
probability constraint. In contrast to prior works that assume i.i.d.
observations, we address a new setting where anomalies evolve according to a
hidden Markov model. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Anomaly
Detection under Hidden Markov model (ADHM), which dynamically adapts the
probing strategy based on accumulated statistical evidence and predictive
belief updates over hidden states. ADHM effectively leverages temporal
correlations to focus sensing resources on the most informative processes. The
algorithm is supported by an asymptotic theoretical foundation, grounded in an
oracle analysis that characterizes the fundamental limits of detection under
the assumption of a known distribution of the hidden states. In addition, the
algorithm demonstrates strong empirical performance, consistently outperforming
existing methods in extensive simulations.

Conclusion: 金字塔采样策略在计算复杂性和功能计算准确性之间实现了可控的权衡，适用于大规模网络。

Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) harnesses the natural superposition of
wireless signals to compute aggregate functions during transmission, thereby
collapsing communication and computation into a single step and significantly
reducing latency and resource usage. In Part I, digital OAC was formulated as a
noise-aware constellation design problem by casting encoder design as a max-min
optimization that aligns minimum Euclidean distances between superimposed
constellation points with squared differences of their corresponding function
outputs.
  In this paper, Part II, we address the prohibitive complexity and
quantization challenges inherent in digital OAC constellation design for
large-scale edge networks. More precisely, we introduce a pyramid sampling
strategy that judiciously selects a subset of superimposed constellation points
to reduce the encoder design complexity from $\mathcal{O}(q^K)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(q^{K-p+1})$, where $p\in\{1,\dots, K\}$ denotes the sampling
order, $q$ levels of modulation, and $K$ denotes the number nodes in the
network. Under the assumption of symmetric aggregation, this approach enables a
controlled trade-off between computational complexity and function computation
accuracy. As a special case, we propose majority-based sampling ($p=K$), which
confines aggregation to only $q$ consensus points, inherently avoiding
destructive overlaps and permitting the use of standard digital modulations
(e.g., QAM, PSK, ASK) without bespoke constellation designs. We also show via
several simulations, across various aggregation functions, modulation levels,
and noise levels, that moderate sampling orders attain acceptable performance
with orders-of-magnitude fewer constraints than exhaustive designs.

Abstract: The upcoming roll-out of the new wireless communication standard for wireless
railway services, FRMCS, requires a thorough understanding of the system
performance in real-world conditions, since this will strongly influence the
deployment costs and the effectiveness of an infrastructure planned for
decades. The virtual testing of the equipment and network performance in
realistic simulated scenarios is key; its accuracy depends on the reliability
of the predicted radio channel properties. In this article, the authors explain
how they are evolving a ray-tracing (RT) tool to apply it to the specific case
of simulating the radio link between the FRMCS fixed infrastructure and an
antenna placed on the roof of a train moving in an urban environment. First, a
dynamic version of the RT tool is used to capture the rapid variations of all
channel metrics; a compromise is sought between computation time and accuracy.
Besides, a hybridization of RT and physical optics (PO) allows the integration
of objects near the track, such as catenary pylons, into the simulation. A case
study shows that the scattering by metallic pylons brings a significant
contribution.

Conclusion: 基于均值场优化的评估有望对6G和NextG标准化产生积极影响。

Abstract: The full-scale 6G standardization has attracted considerable recent
attention, especially since the first 3GPP-wide 6G workshop held in March 2025.
To understand the practical and fundamental values of 6G and facilitate its
standardization, it is crucial to explore the theoretical limits of spectrum,
energy, and coverage efficiency considering practical hardware and signaling
constraints. In this paper, we present a mean-field-approximation-based
investigation on two out of six use case scenarios defined by IMT-2030, namely,
massive communication and ubiquitous connectivity. Being aware of the
limitation in interference cancellation owing to constrained cost and hardware
complexity, we investigate the spectrum reuse architecture in both usage
scenarios. We propose a tractable spectrum reuse with low signaling overhead
consumed for channel estimation and channel state information (CSI) feedback.
Our analysis indicates that the massive communication over cellular and
device-to-device (D2D) networks can benefit from channel orthogonalization,
while it is unnecessary to share the CSI of interfering links. Moreover,
deploying relays or movable base stations, e.g. unmanned aerial vehicle, yields
substantial energy and spectrum gain for ubiquitous connectivity, despite
introducing interference. As such, the mean-field-optimization-based evaluation
is expected to positively impact 6G and NextG standardization in 3GPP and other
standardization bodies.

Motivation: Capon和MMSE波束形成器在信号功率估计中存在偏差问题，无法随着样本量增加而渐近无偏，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了一种改进的Capon$^+$波束形成器，通过优化缩放因子来最小化信号功率估计的均方误差。

Result: Capon$^+$波束形成器在信号功率和波形估计之间取得了更好的平衡，且偏差随样本量增加趋近于零。

Conclusion: Capon$^+$波束形成器显著改善了信号功率估计的偏差问题，是一种更优的波束形成方法。

Abstract: We study the properties of beamformers in their ability to either maintain or
estimate the true signal power of the signal of interest (SOI). Our focus is
particularly on the Capon beamformer and the minimum mean squared error (MMSE)
beamformer. The Capon beamformer, also known as the minimum power
distortionless response (MPDR) or the minimum variance distortionless response
(MVDR) beamformer, is a widely used method in array signal processing. A
curious feature of both the Capon and the MMSE beamformers is their tendency to
either overestimate or underestimate the signal power. That is, they are not
asymptotically unbiased (as the sample size approaches infinity). To address
this issue, we propose to shrink the Capon beamformer by finding a scaling
factor that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the signal power
estimate. The new beamformer, referred to as the Capon$^+$ beamformer, is
evaluated against the Capon and MMSE beamformers in terms of bias, signal power
MSE, and signal waveform MSE. The Capon$^+$ beamformer strikes a better balance
between signal power and waveform estimation while also exhibiting minimal
bias, which approaches zero as the sample size increases.

Abstract: This paper investigates the synergistic potential of reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance
the energy efficiency and performance of next-generation wireless networks. We
delve into the design of energy-efficient passive beamforming (PBF) strategies
within RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point (CoMP)-NOMA networks. Two distinct
RIS configurations, namely, enhancement-only PBF (EO) and enhancement &
cancellation PBF (EC), are proposed and analyzed. Our findings demonstrate that
RIS-assisted CoMP-NOMA networks offer significant efficiency gains compared to
traditional CoMP-NOMA systems. Furthermore, we formulate a PBF design problem
to optimize the RIS phase shifts for maximizing energy efficiency. Our results
reveal that the optimal PBF design is contingent upon several factors,
including the number of cooperating base stations (BSs), the number of RIS
elements deployed, and the RIS configuration. This study underscores the
potential of RIS-assisted CoMP-NOMA networks as a promising solution for
achieving superior energy efficiency and overall performance in future wireless
networks.

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a cost-effective
technology for terahertz (THz) communications by enabling programmable control
of the wireless environment. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of
IRSs-aided THz communications, covering hardware designs, advanced signal
processing techniques, and practical deployment strategies. It first examines
key THz reconfigurable metasurface architectures, including electronic,
optical, phase-change material, and micro-electromechanical systems
(MEMS)-based implementations, highlighting their reconfiguration mechanisms and
challenges. Then, fundamental effects including near field and beam squint in
wideband THz systems are analyzed, along with their impacts on system
performance. The paper further explores conventional and beam-squint-assisted
channel estimation methods, innovative beam management strategies, and
deployment considerations across large- and small-scale scenarios. Practical
experiments at 220 gigahertz (GHz) validate the effectiveness of IRS in
improving signal strength and communication reliability for both single-user
and multi-user setups.

Abstract: Adaptive track initiation remains a crucial component of many modern
multi-target tracking systems. For labeled random finite sets multi-object
filters, prior work has been established to construct a labeled multi-object
birth density using measurements from multiple sensors. A naive construction of
this adaptive birth set density results in an exponential number of newborn
components in the number of sensors. A truncation procedure was provided that
leverages a Gibbs sampler to truncate the birth density, reducing the
complexity to quadratic in the number of sensors. However, only a limited
discussion has been provided on additional algorithmic techniques that can be
employed to substantially reduce the complexity in practical tracking
applications. In this paper, we propose five efficiency enhancements for the
labeled random finite sets multi-sensor adaptive birth procedure. Simulation
results are provided to demonstrate their computational benefits and show that
they result in a negligible change to the multi-target tracking performance.
