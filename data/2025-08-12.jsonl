In this paper, we aim to resolve\nthis issue. First, we present an exact time-domain signal model for OFDM-based\ngrant-free access under frequency-selective fading. Then, we present a maximum\na posteriori (MAP)-based device activity detection problem and two minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE)-based channel estimation problems. The MAP-based device\nactivity detection problem and one of the MMSE-based channel estimation\nproblems are formulated for the first time. Next, we build a new factor graph\nthat captures the exact statistics of time-domain channels and device\nactivities. Based on it, we propose two approximate message passing (AMP)-based\nalgorithms, AMP-A-EC and AMP-A-AC, to approximately solve the MAP-based device\nactivity detection problem and two MMSE-based channel estimation problems. Both\nproposed algorithms alleviate the AMP's inherent convergence problem when the\npilot length is smaller or comparable to the number of active devices. Then, we\nanalyze AMP-A-EC's error probability of activity detection and mean square\nerror (MSE) of channel estimation via state evolution and show that AMP-A-AC\nhas the lower computational complexity (in dominant term). Finally, numerical\nresults show the two proposed AMP-based algorithms' superior performance and\nrespective preferable regions, revealing their significant values for\nOFDM-based grant-free access."}

To address it, two solution\nstrategies are developed. 1) A learning-aided gradient descent (LGD) algorithm\nis proposed, where the constrained problem is reformulated into a\ndifferentiable form and solved through end-to-end learning based on the\nprinciple of gradient descent. The PA position matrix is reparameterized to\ninherently satisfy minimum spacing constraints, while transmit power and\nwaveguide length limits are enforced via projection and normalization. 2) A\ntwo-stage optimization-based approach is designed, in which the transmit\nbeamforming is first optimized via successive convex approximation (SCA),\nfollowed by pinching beamforming optimization using a particle swarm\noptimization (PSO) search over candidate PA placements. The SCA-PSO algorithm\nachieves performance close to that of the element-wise method while\nsignificantly reducing computational complexity by exploring a randomly\ngenerated effective solution subspace, while further improving upon the LGD\nmethod by avoiding undesirable local optima."}

A comprehensive tutorial is presented in\nthis paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS\nsignal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna\nactivation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity\nlimits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance\nmetrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its\nsuperiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching\nbeamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is\nfirst characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general\nmultiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for\nPASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS,\nnamely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical\nprotocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications,\nnamely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A\npossible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further\nhighlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is\nelaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity\nand suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based\napproaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also\nexplored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training\nalgorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation\nwireless networks are highlighted."}

This paper deeply investigates the\napplication of Remote ID for UAV collision avoidance while minimizing\ncommunication delays. First, we propose a Remote ID based distributed multi-UAV\ncollision avoidance (DMUCA) framework to support the collision detection,\navoidance decision-making, and trajectory recovery. Next, the average\ntransmission delays for Remote ID messages are analyzed, incorporating the\npacket reception mechanisms and packet loss due to interference. The\noptimization problem is formulated to minimize the long-term average\ncommunication delay, where UAVs can flexibly select the Remote ID protocol to\nenhance the collision avoidance performance. To tackle the problem, we design a\nmulti-agent deep Q-network based adaptive communication configuration\nalgorithm, allowing UAVs to autonomously learn the optimal protocol\nconfigurations in dynamic environments.
