A critical enabler for\nISAC with Zak-OTFS is the design of pulse shaping filters. For sensing, a\nlocalized pulse shaping filter enables ideal input-output (I/O) relation\nestimates close to the physical scattering channel. For communication,\northogonality of the pulse shape on the information lattice prevents\ninter-symbol interference, and no time and bandwidth expansion enables full\nspectral efficiency. A filter simultaneously meeting all three objectives is\nideal for ISAC. Existing filter designs achieve two of the above objectives,\nbut not all three simultaneously. For instance, the sinc filter is orthogonal\nand bandwidth/time-limited, but is not localized. The Gaussian filter is\nlocalized and bandwidth/time-limited, but not orthogonal. The RRC filter is\nlocalized and orthogonal, but not bandwidth/time-limited. A recently proposed\nhybrid Gaussian-sinc filter is more localized than the sinc filter and\nbandwidth/time-limited, but is not orthogonal. In this work, we design optimal\npulse shaping filters meeting all three objectives via the Isotropic Orthogonal\nTransform Algorithm. The proposed pulse shaping filters offer improved data\ndetection (communication) and I/O relation estimation (sensing) performance\ncompared to existing filter choices in the literature."}
