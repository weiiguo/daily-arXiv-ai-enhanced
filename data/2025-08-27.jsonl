However, current research on XL-RIS overlooks the discrete\nphase-shift characteristics of RIS in practical systems, which will result in\nsignificant performance degradation.In this paper, we investigate near-field\ncommunication schemes assisted by XL-RIS with discrete phase\nshifts.Specifically, we propose a hierarchical beam training method to obtain\nthe user channel state information (CSI), and develop the jointly optimized\ncodebook construction (JOCC) method and separately optimized codebook\nconstruction (SOCC) method for base station (BS) precoding and XL-RIS phase\nshifts, respectively. With JOCC, the most superior beam training performance\ncan be obtained.With SOCC, higher performance than the single-antenna BS\ncodebook can be obtained at a similar complexity.Further, we propose a flexible\nmultiuser interference management (IM) method that is simple to solve. The IM\nmethod uses adaptive gain matrix approximation to take into account user\nfairness and can be solved in closed-form iterations.
