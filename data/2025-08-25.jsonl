Conventional physical-layer security solutions rely on\ndirectional beamforming or artificial noise injection implemented via signal\nprocessing in the baseband (BB) domain. However, these BB-domain approaches are\nconstrained by insufficient spatial resolution and the adverse effects of\nspatially correlated channels. To overcome these limitations, this paper\nproposes a novel secure ISAC framework empowered by compound reconfigurable\nantenna (CRA) arrays, which offer simultaneous reconfigurability of radiation\npatterns and polarization states in the electromagnetic (EM) domain.\nSpecifically, we develop a comprehensive channel model incorporating virtual\nangular domain, spatial domain, and depolarization effects, and formulate a\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly design EM-domain\nand BB-domain precoders and combiners. To efficiently solve this complex\noptimization problem, we propose an iterative decomposition-based algorithm\nleveraging fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM),\nsecond-order cone programming (SOCP), and penalty methods. Extensive simulation\nresults demonstrate that the CRA array architecture with proposed joint EM-and\nBB-domain design achieves significant performance improvements in secure ISAC\nsystems. In particular, radar sensing gains of up to 12dB are observed over\nconventional beamforming, while robust communication security is maintained.\nThese results highlight the considerable benefits attainable by jointly\nleveraging additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the EM domain for secure\nISAC system design."}

To address this, we\ninvestigate Frequency Modulated Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (FM\nOFDM) a constant envelope waveform that facilitates robust joint sensing and\ncommunication under highly mobile, doubly dispersive channel conditions. We\nderive a comprehensive input output relationship for FM OFDM in time varying\nmultipath channels, including analytical expressions for Inter Carrier\nInterference (ICI), Doppler effects, and effective channel gains. Extensive\nsimulations comparing FM OFDM with conventional Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal\nFrequency Division Multiplexing (CP OFDM) and Constant Envelope Orthogonal\nFrequency Division Multiplexing (CE OFDM) demonstrate superior range and\nvelocity estimation accuracy of FM-OFDM, particularly at high Signal to Noise\nRatios (SNRs) and under high mobility, highlighting its suitability as a\nunified waveform for high frequency ISAC applications in 6G."}

The system processes raw radar data through land clutter suppression,\ncell-wise detection, and clustering-based feature extraction. High-threshold\ndetections are used to track strong targets via the point tracker, while\nlow-threshold detections are employed for adaptive birth in the TBD module,\nenabling early initiation and sustained tracking of weak or ambiguous targets.\nValidated using real X-band radar data from the Trondheim Fjord, Norway, the\napproach demonstrates robust multi-target tracking performance in a full-scale\napplication with a large observation area under resource constraints,\nhighlighting its suitability for operational deployment in complex maritime\nenvironments needed for coastal surveillance and to support autonomy."}

The vehicular\nvisible light communication (VVLC) system is a key feature in leveraging\nexisting infrastructures, but it still has several critical challenges.\nEspecially, VVLC channels are highly correlated due to the small gap between\nlight emitting diodes (LEDs) in each headlight, making it difficult to increase\ndata rates by spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we exploit recently\nsynthesized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to reduce the correlation between LEDs,\ni.e., the chiroptical properties of GNPs for differential absorption depending\non the azimuth angle of incident light are used to mitigate the LED\ncorrelation. In addition, we adopt a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio\n(SLNR)-based precoder to support multiple users. The ratio of RGB light sources\nin each LED also needs to be optimized to maximize the sum SLNR satisfying a\nwhite light constraint for illumination since the GNPs can vary the color of\ntransmitted light by the differential absorption across wavelength. The\nnonconvex optimization problems for precoders and RGB ratios can be solved by\nthe generalized Rayleigh quotient with the approximated shot noise and\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA). The simulation results show that the\nSLNR-based precoder with the optimized RGB ratios significantly improves the\nsum rate in a multi-user vehicular environment and the secrecy rate in a\nwiretapping scenario. The proposed SLNR-based precoding verifies that the\ndecorrelation between LEDs and the RGB ratio optimization are essential to\nenhance the VVLC performance."}
