### [1] [Deep-OFDM: Neural Modulation for High Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17530)
*Sravan Kumar Ankireddy,S. Ashwin Hebbar,Pramod Viswanath,Hyeji Kim*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Deep-OFDM是一种基于神经网络的调制框架，通过端到端训练优化传统OFDM，显著提高了在高移动性场景下的性能，减少了导频开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OFDM在高移动性场景下存在载波间干扰和频谱效率低的问题，需要密集导频和循环前缀。

Method: 提出Deep-OFDM，使用卷积神经网络调制器将信息分散到OFDM网格中，并与神经接收器联合优化。

Result: 在稀疏导频和无导频场景下，Deep-OFDM显著降低了BLER并提高了吞吐量，尤其在高多普勒频率下表现优异。

Conclusion: Deep-OFDM展示了发射端与接收端协同设计的潜力，为下一代无线系统的AI原生物理层设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the foundational
waveform in current 5G deployments due to its robustness in quasi-static
channels and efficient spectrum use. However, in high-mobility scenarios, OFDM
suffers from inter-carrier interference (ICI), and its reliance on dense pilot
patterns and cyclic prefixes significantly reduces spectral efficiency. In this
work, we propose Deep-OFDM: a learnable modulation framework that augments
traditional OFDM by incorporating neural parameterization. Instead of mapping
each symbol to a fixed resource element, Deep-OFDM spreads information across
the OFDM grid using a convolutional neural network modulator. This modulator is
jointly optimized with a neural receiver through end-to-end training, enabling
the system to adapt to time-varying channels without relying on explicit
channel estimation. Deep-OFDM outperforms conventional OFDM when paired with
neural receiver baselines, particularly in pilot-sparse and pilotless regimes,
achieving substantial gains in BLER and goodput, especially at high Doppler
frequencies. In the pilotless setting, the neural modulator learns a low-rank
structure that resembles a superimposed pilot, effectively enabling reliable
communication without explicit overhead. Deep-OFDM demonstrates significant
improvements in BLER and goodput at high Doppler frequencies across various
scenarios, including MIMO systems. Comprehensive ablation studies quantify the
role of nonlinear activations and characterize performance-complexity
trade-offs. These results highlight the potential of transmitter-receiver
co-design for robust, resource-efficient communication, paving the way for
AI-native physical layer designs in next-generation wireless systems.

Abstract: As an emerging flexible antenna technology for wireless communications,
pinching-antenna systems, offer distinct advantages in terms of cost efficiency
and deployment flexibility. This paper investigates joint transmission
strategies of the base station (BS) and pinching antennas (PAS), focusing
specifically on how to cooperate efficiently between the BS and
waveguide-mounted pinching antennas for enhancing the performance of the user
equipment (UE). By jointly considering the performance, flexibility, and
complexity, we propose three joint BS-PAS transmission schemes along with the
best beamforming designs, namely standalone deployment (SD), semi-cooperative
deployment (SCD) and full-cooperative deployment (FCD). More specifically, for
each BS-PAS joint transmission scheme, we conduct a comprehensive performance
analysis in terms of the power allocation strategy, beamforming design, and
practical implementation considerations. We also derive closed-form expressions
for the average received SNR across the proposed BS-PAS joint transmission
schemes, which are verified through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, numerical
results demonstrate that deploying pinching antennas in cellular networks,
particularly through cooperation between the BS and PAS, can achieve
significant performance gains. We further identify and characterize the key
network parameters that influence the performance, providing insights for
deploying pinching antennas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号恢复是科学和工程中的基础问题，已知信号可能属于某个代数簇，因此需要确定恢复所需的最小测量数。

Conclusion: 本文不仅连接了抽象代数概念与信号处理，还提出了多个开放问题，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The recovery of an unknown signal from its linear measurements is a
fundamental problem spanning numerous scientific and engineering disciplines.
Commonly, prior knowledge suggests that the underlying signal resides within a
known algebraic variety. This context naturally leads to a question: what is
the minimum number of measurements required to uniquely recover any signal
belonging to such an algebraic variety? In this survey paper, we introduce a
method that leverages tools from algebraic geometry to address this question.
We then demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to two
problems: phase retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery. %Furthermore, this
paper bridges abstract algebraic concepts with concrete signal processing. We
also highlight several open problems, which could serve as a basis for future
investigations in this field.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了闪存PIM系统中的可靠性问题。

Abstract: Flash memory-based processing-in-memory (flash-based PIM) offers high storage
capacity and computational efficiency but faces significant reliability
challenges due to noise in high-density multi-level cell (MLC) flash memories.
Existing verify level optimization methods are designed for general storage
scenarios and fail to address the unique requirements of flash-based PIM
systems, where metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are critical. This paper introduces an integrated
framework that jointly optimizes quantization and verify levels to minimize the
MSE, considering both quantization and flash memory channel errors. We develop
an iterative algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem. Experimental
results on quantized images and SwinIR model parameters stored in flash memory
show that the proposed method significantly improves the reliability of
flash-based PIM systems.

### [5] [Virtual Teleportation of CSIT via Non-Signaling Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17803)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了非信号（NS）相关性在经典通信网络容量中的潜在影响，展示了NS辅助下点对点信道和广播信道的容量与经典容量的匹配性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子非局域性对经典通信网络容量的影响，特别是NS相关性在无线网络中的显著优势。

Method: 通过分析点对点离散无记忆信道和广播信道，比较NS辅助下与经典设置下的容量，提出“虚拟CSIT远程传输”的关键见解。

Result: NS辅助下点对点信道和广播信道的容量与经典容量匹配；半确定性广播信道中，全NS辅助与部分NS辅助效果相同。

Conclusion: NS相关性在某些信道设置中可以显著提升容量，但并非所有情况下都优于经典方法。

Abstract: Non-signaling correlations, which (strictly) include quantum correlations,
provide a tractable path to explore the potential impact of quantum nonlocality
on the capacity of classical communication networks. Motivated by a recent
discovery that certain wireless network settings benefit significantly from
non-signaling (NS) correlations, various generalizations are considered. First,
it is shown that for a point to point discrete memoryless channel with a
non-causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the NS-assisted
Shannon capacity matches the classical (without NS assistance) capacity of the
channel for the setting where the state is also made available to the receiver.
The key insight is summarized as 'virtual teleportation of CSIT via
NS-assistance' and is supported by further results as follows. For a discrete
memoryless 2-user broadcast channel (BC), the Shannon capacity region with
NS-assistance available only between the transmitter and User 1, is found next.
Consistent with the aforementioned key insight, the result matches the
classical capacity region for the setting where the desired message of User 2
is made available in advance as side-information to User 1. The latter capacity
region is known from a result of Kramer and Shamai. Next, for a
semi-deterministic BC, the Shannon capacity region with full (tripartite)
NS-assistance is shown to be the same as if only bipartite NS-assistance was
available between the transmitter and the non-deterministic user. Bipartite
NS-assistance between the transmitter and only the deterministic user, does not
improve the capacity region relative to the corresponding classical setting.
Finally, the analysis is extended to a K-user BC with full NS-assistance among
all parties.

### [6] [Robust Energy-Efficient DRL-Based Optimization in UAV-Mounted RIS Systems with Jitter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17971)
*Mahmoud M. Salim,Khaled M. Rabie,Ali H. Muqaibel*

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了复杂优化问题，显著提升了能量收集效率，为无人机通信系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this letter, we propose an energy-efficient design for an unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV)-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) communication
system with nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) and UAV jitter. A joint
optimization problem is formulated to maximize the EH efficiency of the
UAV-mounted RIS by controlling the user powers, RIS phase shifts, and
time-switching factor, subject to quality of service and practical EH
constraints. The problem is nonconvex and time-coupled due to UAV angular
jitter and nonlinear EH dynamics, making it intractable for conventional
optimization methods. To address this, we reformulate the problem as a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) environment and develop a smoothed softmax dual
deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The proposed method incorporates
action clipping, entropy regularization, and softmax-weighted Q-value
estimation to improve learning stability and exploration. Simulation results
show that the proposed algorithm converges reliably under various UAV jitter
levels and achieves an average EH efficiency of 45.07\%, approaching the
53.09\% upper bound of exhaustive search, and outperforming other DRL
baselines.

Conclusion: 本文总结了FR3在6G中的ISAC应用潜力，并指出了基于ELAAs的ISAC面临的挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Spanning 7-24 GHz, frequency range 3 (FR3), is a key enabler for
next-generation wireless networks by bridging the coverage of sub-6 GHz and the
capacity of millimeter-wave bands. Its unique propagation characteristics, such
as extended near-field regions and spatially nonstationary fading, enable new
transmission strategies. This article explores the potential of FR3 for
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which unifies wireless
communication and environmental sensing. We show that FR3's bandwidth and
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) capabilities enable high-resolution
sensing, multi-target tracking, and fast data transmission. We emphasize the
importance of ultra-massive MIMO with extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs)
and the need for unified near-field and far-field channel models to support
efficient ISAC. Finally, we outline challenges and future research directions
for ELAA-based ISAC in 6G FR3.

### [8] [Rack-Aware MSR Codes with Linear Field Size and Smaller Sub-Packetization for Tolerating Multiple Erasures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18367)
*Hengming Zhao,Dianhua Wu,Minquan Cheng*

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何修复同一机架中多个故障节点，并优化修复带宽和子分组大小。

Result: 第一类MSR码实现了较小的子分组和线性增长的字段大小；第二类MSR码进一步减小了子分组。

Conclusion: 提出的MSR码在修复带宽和子分组方面优于现有方法，适用于更广泛的参数范围。

Abstract: In an $(n,k,d)$ rack-aware storage model, the system consists of $n$ nodes
uniformly distributed across $\bar{n}$ successive racks, such that each rack
contains $u$ nodes of equal capacity and the reconstructive degree satisfies
$k=\bar{k}u+v$ where $0\leq v\leq u-1$. Suppose there are $h\geq1$ failed nodes
in a rack (called the host rack). Then together with its surviving nodes, the
host rack downloads recovery data from $\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its
failed nodes. In this paper, we focus on studying the rack-aware minimum
storage generating (MSR) codes for repairing $h$ failed nodes within the same
rack. By using the coupled-layer construction with the alignment technique, we
construct the first class of rack-aware MSR codes for all
$\bar{k}+1\leq\bar{d}\leq\bar{n}-1$ which achieve the small sub-packetization
$l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/\bar{s}\rceil}$ where the field size $q$ increases
linearly with $n$ and $\bar{s}=\bar{d}-\bar{k}+1$. In addition, these codes
achieve optimal repair bandwidth for $1\leq h\leq u-v$, and asymptotically
optimal repair bandwidth for $u-v+1\leq h\leq u$. In particular, they achieve
optimal access when $h=u-v$. It is worth noting that the existing rack-aware
MSR codes which achieve the same sub-packetization
$l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/\bar{s}\rceil}$ are only known for the special case
of $\bar{d}=\bar{n}-1$, $h=1$, and the field size is much larger than ours.
Then, based on our first construction we further develop another class of
explicit rack-aware MSR codes with even smaller sub-packetization
$l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/(\bar{s}+1)\rceil}$ for all admissible values of
$\bar{d}$.

### [9] [$(\ell,δ)$-Diversity: Linkage-Robustness via a Composition Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18405)
*V. Arvind Rameshwar,Anshoo Tandon*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了匿名数据集链接导致的匿名性退化问题，提出了(ℓ,δ)-多样性的定义及实现机制，并分析了其退化界限和效用优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决多匿名数据集链接时用户敏感信息可能被泄露的问题，即使单个数据集满足ℓ-多样性。

Method: 方法包括定义(ℓ,δ)-多样性，提出实现机制，并通过类似差分隐私的“组合定理”分析其退化界限。

Result: 结果表明，近似多样性在链接时能较好地保持匿名性，同时提供了效用优化的算法和特定分布下的效用下界。

Conclusion: 结论是(ℓ,δ)-多样性能有效缓解链接攻击带来的匿名性退化问题，并提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of degradation of anonymity upon
linkages of anonymized datasets. We work in the setting where an adversary
links together $t\geq 2$ anonymized datasets in which a user of interest
participates, based on the user's known quasi-identifiers, which motivates the
use of $\ell$-diversity as the notion of dataset anonymity. We first argue that
in the worst case, such linkage attacks can reveal the exact sensitive
attribute of the user, even when each dataset respects $\ell$-diversity, for
moderately large values of $\ell$. This issue motivates our definition of
(approximate) $(\ell,\delta)$-diversity -- a parallel of (approximate)
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) -- which simply requires that a
dataset respect $\ell$-diversity, with high probability. We then present a
mechanism for achieving $(\ell,\delta)$-diversity, in the setting of
independent and identically distributed samples. Next, we establish bounds on
the degradation of $(\ell,\delta)$-diversity, via a simple ``composition
theorem,'' similar in spirit to those in the DP literature, thereby showing
that approximate diversity, unlike standard diversity, is roughly preserved
upon linkage. Finally, we describe simple algorithms for maximizing utility,
measured in terms of the number of anonymized ``equivalence classes,'' and
derive explicit lower bounds on the utility, for special sample distributions.

### [10] [Multi-user Downlink with Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18418)
*Xuejian Wei,Hui-Ming Wang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可重构智能超表面天线（RIMSA）的无线系统，通过联合优化数字处理矩阵和RIMSA相位响应，解决了多用户场景下的速率最大化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索可重构智能超表面（RIS）在6G无线通信中的潜力，特别是将其作为天线（RIMSA）应用于多用户传输场景。

Method: 针对MU-MISO和MU-MIMO场景，分别提出交替优化算法和加权均方误差最小化问题，结合分数规划和乘积流形优化（PMO）算法。

Result: 仿真结果显示，所提算法在性能上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RIMSA系统在多用户通信中具有显著性能优势，为6G通信提供了新的技术方向。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is a transformative technology with
great potential in many applications in wireless communications and realizing
the Internet of Everything at sixth generation (6G). In this study, we propose
a wireless system where the RIS acts as an antenna, which we call
Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA). In particular, the
base station (BS) equipped with a RIMSA array performs downlink transmissions
to multiple users, where each user has a single or multiple RIMSA/RF links, and
we aim to solve the sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the
digital processing matrix of the transceivers and the phase responses of RIMSA
array at both BS and users. For the multi-user multiple-input single-output
(MU-MISO) scenario, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm to slove
the problem, where a fractional programming (FP) is used to optimize the
digital processing matrix and a product manifold optimization (PMO) is proposed
to provide the optimal phase responses of the RIMSA array at both BS and users.
For the multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenario, we equate
it to a weighted sum of mean square errors minimization problem, which can be
solved by three subproblems iteratively. Both the optimal digital precoder
subproblem and the optimal digital combiner subproblem have closed-form
solutions, and the subproblem of RIMSA configuration is solved by the PMO
algorithm as well. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms
achieve significant performance gains over conventional algorithms.

*Alberto Liardi,George Blackburne,Hardik Rajpal,Fernando E. Rosas,Pedro A. M. Mediano*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为M-information的新方法，用于量化复杂动态系统中的高阶信息整合，解决了现有技术在大规模神经系统中应用受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经系统的分布式计算和信息整合需要更高效的工具，现有方法在大规模系统中难以应用。

Method: 通过凸优化问题计算M-information，并开发了一种高效算法，适用于多变量时间序列数据。

Result: M-information对噪声具有鲁棒性，能反映人工神经元群体的临界行为和小鼠脑活动数据的任务表现。

Conclusion: M-information为理解复杂神经系统的集体计算提供了新工具，并可整合到现有信息分解框架中。

Abstract: Our understanding of neural systems rests on our ability to characterise how
they perform distributed computation and integrate information. Advances in
information theory have introduced several quantities to describe complex
information structures, where collective patterns of coordination emerge from
high-order (i.e. beyond-pairwise) interdependencies. Unfortunately, the use of
these approaches to study large neural systems is severely hindered by the poor
scalability of existing techniques. Moreover, there are relatively few measures
specifically designed for multivariate time series data. Here we introduce a
novel measure of information about macroscopic structures, termed
M-information, which quantifies the high-order integration of information in
complex dynamical systems. We show that M-information can be calculated via a
convex optimisation problem, and we derive a robust and efficient algorithm
that scales gracefully with system size. Our analyses show that M-information
is resilient to noise, indexes critical behaviour in artificial neuronal
populations, and reflects task performance in real-world mouse brain activity
data. Furthermore, M-information can be incorporated into existing information
decomposition frameworks to reveal a comprehensive taxonomy of information
dynamics. Taken together, these results help us unravel collective computation
in complex neural systems.

### [12] [A Simple but Accurate Approximation for Multivariate Gaussian Rate-Distortion Function and Its Application in Maximal Coding Rate Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18613)
*Zhenglin Huang,Qifa Yan,Bin Dai,Xiaohu Tang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单但准确的多元高斯率失真（RD）函数近似方法，并推导了近似误差的上下界。基于此近似，提出了一种新的分类算法AR-ReduNet，其性能优于原ReduNet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元高斯RD函数在多种应用中至关重要，但其复杂形式限制了其在神经网络场景中的应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种多元高斯RD函数的近似方法，并推导了近似误差的上下界。进一步将该近似应用于ReduNet，提出了AR-ReduNet算法。

Result: 对于条件数良好的协方差矩阵，近似误差较小。AR-ReduNet在仿真中表现出更高的准确性和优化效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的近似方法有效且实用，AR-ReduNet在分类任务中优于原ReduNet。

Abstract: The multivariate Gaussian rate-distortion (RD) function is crucial in various
applications, such as digital communications, data storage, or neural networks.
However, the complex form of the multivariate Gaussian RD function prevents its
application in many neural network-based scenarios that rely on its analytical
properties, for example, white-box neural networks, multi-device task-oriented
communication, and semantic communication. This paper proposes a simple but
accurate approximation for the multivariate Gaussian RD function. The upper and
lower bounds on the approximation error (the difference between the approximate
and the exact value) are derived, which indicate that for well-conditioned
covariance matrices, the approximation error is small. In particular, when the
condition number of the covariance matrix approaches 1, the approximation error
approaches 0. In addition, based on the proposed approximation, a new
classification algorithm called Adaptive Regularized ReduNet (AR-ReduNet) is
derived by applying the approximation to ReduNet, which is a white-box
classification network oriented from Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR$^2$)
principle. Simulation results indicate that AR-ReduNet achieves higher accuracy
and more efficient optimization than ReduNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于秩和度量码的研究结果有限，尤其是在参数确定方面存在挑战。

Method: 通过二次Kummer扩展，提出了两种通用的$2\times2$秩和码构造方法。

Result: 新构造的码在相同参数约束下，码长优于线性化Reed-Solomon码，并明确了维度和最小距离等参数。

Conclusion: 通过椭圆函数域的实例验证了理论框架的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents new constructions of sum-rank metric codes derived from
algebraic function fields, while the existing results about such codes remain
limited. A central challenge in this field involves the determination of
parameters. We address this challenge through quadratic Kummer extensions, and
propose two general constructions of $2\times2$ sum-rank codes. The novel
sum-rank metric code constructions derived from algebraic function fields
demonstrate superior code lengths compared to conventional coding paradigms,
particularly when contrasted with linearized Reed-Solomon codes under
equivalent code parameter constraints. We also establish explicit parameters
including dimensions and minimum distances of our codes. Finally, an
illustrative example through elliptic function fields is constructed for
validating the theoretical framework.

### [14] [Semidefinite Programming for the Asymmetric Stochastic Block Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18754)
*Julia Gaudio,Phawin Prongpaophan*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了对称半定规划（sym-SDP）在非对称二元随机块模型中的失败情况，并提出了改进的SDP设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SDP在非对称块模型中实现精确恢复的可能性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 分析sym-SDP在非对称情况下的失败原因，提出新的SDP设计。

Result: sym-SDP在非对称情况下无法正确标记顶点，新SDP设计存在分析困难。

Conclusion: SDP设计在社区检测中存在根本性限制，需进一步研究。

Abstract: We consider semidefinite programming (SDP) for the binary stochastic block
model with equal-sized communities. Prior work of Hajek, Wu, and Xu proposed an
SDP (sym-SDP) for the symmetric case where the intra-community edge
probabilities are equal, and showed that the SDP achieves the
information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery under the symmetry
assumption. A key open question is whether SDPs can be used to achieve exact
recovery for non-symmetric block models. In order to inform the design of a new
SDP for the non-symmetric setting, we investigate the failure of sym-SDP when
it is applied to non-symmetric settings. We formally show that sym-SDP fails to
return the correct labeling of the vertices in some information-theoretically
feasible, asymmetric cases. In addition, we give an intuitive geometric
interpretation of the failure of sym-SDP in asymmetric settings, which in turn
suggests an SDP formulation to handle the asymmetric setting. Still, this new
SDP cannot be readily analyzed by existing techniques, suggesting a fundamental
limitation in the design of SDPs for community detection.

*Roni Con,Ray Li*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文构建了在‘遗忘模型’下的删除纠错码，填补了对抗性和随机错误模型之间的空白，并展示了在DNA存储等应用中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决由难以建模的物理现象（如DNA存储中的噪声）引起的错误，而非对抗性错误。

Method: 方法包括构建显式和随机的遗忘删除码，利用列表解码技术，并通过减少哈希大小来优化冗余。

Result: 结果显示显式遗忘码的冗余与对抗性删除码匹配，随机遗忘码的冗余优于对抗性删除码。

Conclusion: 结论表明遗忘模型的研究不仅优化了自身性能，还为对抗性删除码的构造提供了新思路。

Abstract: We construct deletion error-correcting codes in the oblivious model, where
errors are adversarial but oblivious to the encoder's randomness. Oblivious
errors bridge the gap between the adversarial and random error models, and are
motivated by applications like DNA storage, where the noise is caused by
hard-to-model physical phenomena, but not by an adversary.
  (1) (Explicit oblivious) We construct $t$ oblivious deletion codes, with
redundancy $\sim 2t\log n$, matching the existential bound for adversarial
deletions.
  (2) (List decoding implies explicit oblivious) We show that explicit
list-decodable codes yield explicit oblivious deletion codes with essentially
the same parameters. By a work of Guruswami and H\r{a}stad (IEEE TIT, 2021),
this gives 2 oblivious deletion codes with redundancy $\sim 3\log n$, beating
the existential redundancy for 2 adversarial deletions.
  (3) (Randomized oblivious) We give a randomized construction of oblivious
codes that, with probability at least $1-2^{-n}$, produces a code correcting
$t$ oblivious deletions with redundancy $\sim(t+1)\log n$, beating the
existential adversarial redundancy of $\sim 2t\log n$.
  (4) (Randomized adversarial) Studying the oblivious model can inform better
constructions of adversarial codes. The same technique produces, with
probability at least $1-2^{-n}$, a code correcting $t$ adversarial deletions
with redundancy $\sim (2t+1)\log n$, nearly matching the existential redundancy
of $\sim 2t\log n$.
  The common idea behind these results is to reduce the hash size by modding by
a prime chosen (randomly) from a small subset, and including a small encoding
of the prime in the hash.

### [16] [Two-Stage Prony-Based Estimation of Fractional Delay and Doppler Shifts in OTFS Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17599)
*Yutaka Jitsumatsu,Liangchen Sun*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Prony技术的两阶段估计方法，用于高移动环境中多径信道的分数延迟和多普勒频移估计，提高了ISAC系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高移动环境中，多径信道引起的分数延迟和多普勒频移会导致双选择性衰落，影响ISAC系统的性能。OTFS调制虽然能简化信道补偿，但分数分量会引入路径间干扰，降低估计精度。

Method: 采用两阶段估计方法：第一阶段利用OTFS导频信号的周期性，通过联合求解M个耦合的Prony方程估计多普勒频率；第二阶段对每个多普勒分量应用DFT和Prony方法估计延迟。

Result: 在无噪声条件下，该方法能准确估计最多N-1个延迟-多普勒参数；在噪声环境中，采用启发式模型阶数选择优于传统信息准则。

Conclusion: 数值模拟表明，该方法具有高估计精度，适用于未来ISAC框架。

Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation of fractional delay and Doppler shifts in
multipath channels that cause doubly selective fading-an essential task for
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in high-mobility
environments. Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation enables simple
and robust channel compensation under such conditions. However, fractional
delay and Doppler components introduce inter-path interference, degrading
estimation accuracy. We propose a two-stage estimation method based on Prony's
technique using OTFS pilot signals with M subchannels and N pilot repetitions.
In the first stage, Doppler frequencies are estimated by jointly solving M
coupled Prony equations, exploiting the periodicity of the pilot signal. In the
second stage, delays are estimated by applying the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) and Prony's method to each Doppler component obtained in the first stage.
The proposed method can accurately estimate up to N-1 delay-Doppler parameters
under noiseless conditions. In noisy environments, conventional information
criteria such as AIC and BIC yield suboptimal performance; thus, a heuristic
model order selection is adopted. Numerical simulations confirm that the
proposed method achieves high estimation accuracy, highlighting its potential
for future ISAC frameworks.

Abstract: Multi-condition fault diagnosis is prevalent in industrial systems and
presents substantial challenges for conventional diagnostic approaches. The
discrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions
degrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied
to others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has
been introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing
multi-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization
approaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault
features. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific
multi-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect
fault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the
extent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely
studied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact
on fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the
model to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall
generalization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing
end-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically
in variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a
real-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,
aiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant
operating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with
a retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant
fault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the
source domain. Several experiments on a real-world gearbox dataset are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: 基于CNN的定位方法在近场混合LoS/non-LoS场景中具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: The conventional MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm is
effective for angle-of-arrival estimation in the far-field and can be extended
for full source localization in the near-field. However, it suffers from high
computational complexity, which becomes especially prohibitive in near-field
scenarios due to the need for exhaustive 3D grid searches. This paper presents
a machine learning-based approach for 3D localization of near-field sources in
mixed line-of-sight (LoS)/non-LoS scenarios. A convolutional neural network
(CNN) learns the mapping between the eigenvectors of the received signal's
covariance matrix at the anchor node and the sources' 3D locations. The
detailed description of the proposed CNN model is provided. The effectiveness
and time efficiency of the proposed CNN-based localization approach is
corroborated via numerical simulations.

Motivation: 下一代蜂窝部署将利用6-24 GHz频段和XL-MIMO技术以实现超高数据速率和可靠性，但现有3GPP信道模型中的远场和空间平稳性假设不再适用。

Result: 性能评估表明，近场模型比远场模型具有更高的信道容量潜力，SNS导致更显著的传播衰落。

Conclusion: 该框架为XL-MIMO系统提供了更准确的信道建模方法，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Next generation cellular deployments are expected to exploit the 6-24 GHz
frequency range 3 (FR3) and extremely large-scale multiple-input
multiple-output (XL-MIMO) to enable ultra-high data rates and reliability.
However, the significantly enlarged antenna apertures and higher carrier
frequencies render the far-field and spatial stationarity assumptions in the
existing 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) channel models invalid,
giving rise to new features such as near-field propagation and spatial
non-stationarity (SNS). Despite extensive prior research, incorporating these
new features within the standardized channel modeling framework remains an open
issue. To address this, this paper presents a channel modeling framework for
XL-MIMO systems that incorporates both near-field and SNS features, adopted by
3GPP. For the near-field propagation feature, the framework models the
distances from the base station (BS) and user equipment to the spherical-wave
sources associated with clusters. These distances are used to characterize
element-wise variations of path parameters, such as nonlinear changes in phase
and angle. To capture the effect of SNS at the BS side, a stochastic-based
approach is proposed to model SNS caused by incomplete scattering, by
establishing power attenuation factors from visibility probability and
visibility region to characterize antenna element-wise path power variation. In
addition, a physical blocker-based approach is introduced to model SNS effects
caused by partial blockage. Finally, a simulation framework for near-field and
SNS is developed within the structure of the existing 3GPP channel model.
Performance evaluations demonstrate that the near-field model captures higher
channel capacity potential compared to the far-field model. Coupling loss
results indicate that SNS leads to more pronounced propagation fading relative
to the spatial stationary model.

<details>

Motivation: 探索如何在ISAC网络中通过基站部署实现高精度目标定位和高吞吐量通信的平衡，并确保整个服务区域的定位精度一致性。

Method: 采用基于飞行时间（ToF）的定位方法，从定位性能覆盖角度分析部署问题，最小化区域Cramer-Rao下界（A-CRLB）以确保均匀高精度定位。

Result: 证明了在固定基站数量下，服务区域均匀缩放因子κ会导致最优A-CRLB按比例增加κ^{2β}，并推导了感知区域维度与A-CRLB的近似缩放规律。

Conclusion: 合作基站扩展了覆盖范围，但随着感知区域维度的增加，A-CRLB的改善有限。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks strive to deliver both
high-precision target localization and high-throughput data services across the
entire coverage area. In this work, we examine the fundamental trade-off
between sensing and communication from the perspective of base station (BS)
deployment. Furthermore, we conceive a design that simultaneously maximizes the
target localization coverage, while guaranteeing the desired communication
performance. In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an
effective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy
throughout the entire service area. While employing time-of-flight (ToF) based
localization, we first analyze the deployment problem from a
localization-performance coverage perspective, aiming for minimizing the area
Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (A-CRLB) to ensure uniformly high positioning accuracy
across the service area. We prove that for a fixed number of BSs, uniformly
scaling the service area by a factor \kappa increases the optimal A-CRLB in
proportion to \kappa^{2\beta}, where \beta is the BS-to-target pathloss
exponent. Based on this, we derive an approximate scaling law that links the
achievable A-CRLB across the area of interest to the dimensionality of the
sensing area. We also show that cooperative BSs extends the coverage but yields
marginal A-CRLB improvement as the dimensionality of the sensing area grows.

Abstract: The burgeoning low-altitude economy (LAE) necessitates integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems capable of high-accuracy multi-target localization
and velocity estimation under hardware and coverage constraints inherent in
conventional ISAC architectures. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a cooperative bistatic ISAC framework within MIMO-OFDM cellular
networks, enabling robust sensing services for LAE applications through
standardized 5G New Radio (NR) infrastructure. We first develop a
low-complexity parameter extraction algorithm employing CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
tensor decomposition, which exploits the inherent Vandermonde structure in
delay-related factor matrices to efficiently recover bistatic ranges, Doppler
velocities, and angles-of-arrival (AoA) from multi-dimensional received signal
tensors. To resolve data association ambiguity across distributed
transmitter-receiver pairs and mitigate erroneous estimates, we further design
a robust fusion scheme based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) method,
enabling joint 3D position and velocity reconstruction. Comprehensive
simulation results validate the framework's superiority in computational
efficiency and sensing performance for low-altitude scenarios.

Abstract: Accurately tracking an unknown and time-varying number of objects in complex
environments is a significant challenge but a fundamental capability in a
variety of applications, including applied ocean sciences, surveillance,
autonomous driving, and wireless communications. Conventional Bayesian
multiobject tracking (MOT) methods typically employ a detect-then-track (DTT)
approach, where a frontend detector preprocesses raw sensor data to extract
measurements for MOT. The irreversible nature of this preprocessing step can
discard valuable object-related information, particularly impairing the ability
to resolve weak or closely spaced objects. The track-before-detect (TBD)
paradigm offers an alternative by operating directly on sensor data. However,
existing TBD approaches introduce simplifications to facilitate the development
of inference methods, such as assuming known signal amplitudes or conditional
independence between sensor measurements given object states. These assumptions
can lead to suboptimal performance and limit the applicability of the resulting
TBD methods in realistic scenarios.
  This paper introduces coherent TBD based on a comprehensive signal model for
sensor data. The new model accounts for sensor data correlations and amplitude
fluctuations, enabling the accurate representation of the physics of the
data-generating process in TBD. Coherent TBD is suitable for a wide range of
problems in active and passive radar, active and passive sonar, as well as
integrated sensing and communication systems. Based on a factor graph
representation of the new measurement model, a scalable belief propagation (BP)
method is developed to perform efficient Bayesian inference. Experimental
results, performed with both synthetic and real data, demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art conventional MOT methods.

Conclusion: 多模态数据融合方法优于仅依赖射频导频的传统方法，是高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes an approach that leverages multimodal data by integrating
visual images with radio frequency (RF) pilots to optimize user association and
beamforming in a downlink wireless cellular network under a max-min fairness
criterion. Traditional methods typically optimize wireless system parameters
based on channel state information (CSI). However, obtaining accurate CSI
requires extensive pilot transmissions, which lead to increased overhead and
latency. Moreover, the optimization of user association and beamforming is a
discrete and non-convex optimization problem, which is challenging to solve
analytically. In this paper, we propose to incorporate visual camera data in
addition to the RF pilots to perform the joint optimization of user association
and beamforming. The visual image data helps enhance channel awareness, thereby
reducing the dependency on extensive pilot transmissions for system
optimization. We employ a learning-based approach based on using first a
detection neural network that estimates user locations from images, and
subsequently two graph neural networks (GNNs) that extract features for system
optimization based on the location information and the received pilots,
respectively. Then, a multimodal GNN is constructed to integrate the features
for the joint optimization user association and beamforming. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance, while
having low computational complexity and being interpretable and generalizable,
making it an effective solution as compared to traditional methods based only
on RF pilots.

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks have constituted an emerging method for synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) imaging. However, baseline unfolding networks, when
unfolded from the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), lack
generalization capability across scenes as the regularizers are empirically
designed. In this study, we introduce a learnable regularizer to the unfolding
network and create an adaptively regularized SAR imaging network (ARSAR-Net),
which pursues generalization capability across scenes, including varying
sparsity levels and heterogeneous scenes with offshore ships, islands, urban
areas, and mountainous terrain. In practice, the vanilla ARSAR-Net suffers from
inherent structural limitations in 2D signal processing, primarily due to its
reliance on matrix inversion. To conquer this challenge, we introduce the
non-matrix-inversion ADMM algorithm, which replaces inefficient matrix
inversion with efficient linear approximations. Extensive validation through
simulated and real-data experiments (including GF-3 satellite echoes)
demonstrates ARSAR-Net's triple advantage: (1) 50\% faster imaging speed
compared to existing unfolding networks, (2) up to 2.0 dB PSNR improvement in
imaging quality, and (3) enhanced adaptability to complex heterogeneous scenes.
These advancements establish a new paradigm for computationally efficient and
generalizable SAR imaging systems.

Abstract: This paper focuses on wireless multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) receivers. Traditional
wireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference,
achieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability
to characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated
significant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional
inference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the
error progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems,
generative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased
attention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using
diffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models,
we can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate
traditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the
diffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the
diffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying
noise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing
training and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot
densities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces
channel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading
deep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in
low-pilot conditions. Additionally, performance enhancements can be achieved
with a larger imagination size, despite increased computational complexity.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks
necessitates the seamless integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with
wireless communications to support emerging intelligent applications that
demand both efficient communication and robust learning performance. This dual
requirement calls for a unified framework of integrated learning and
communication (ILAC), where AI enhances communication through intelligent
signal processing and adaptive resource management, while wireless networks
support AI model deployment by enabling efficient and reliable data exchanges.
However, achieving this integration presents significant challenges in
practice. Communication constraints, such as limited bandwidth and fluctuating
channels, hinder learning accuracy and convergence. Simultaneously, AI-driven
learning dynamics, including model updates and task-driven inference, introduce
excessive burdens on communication systems, necessitating flexible,
context-aware transmission strategies. Finally, we present a case study on a
cost-to-performance optimization problem, where task assignments, model size
selection, bandwidth allocation, and transmission power control are jointly
optimized, considering computational cost, communication efficiency, and
inference accuracy. Leveraging the Dinkelbach and alternating optimization
algorithms, we offer a practical and effective solution to achieve an optimal
balance between learning performance and communication constraints.

Abstract: This paper presents key performance metrics for near-field communication and
sensing systems with a focus on their scaling behavior as a function of the
antenna array aperture. Analytical expressions are derived for several standard
array geometries to enable the design of the large antenna arrays for given
system requirements. First, the near-field beam focusing is analyzed and the
minimum beamdepth is observed to rapidly saturate to a low asymptotic limit as
the array aperture increases. In contrast, the near-field region span is shown
to scale quadratically with the array aperture. Based on these two metrics, the
maximum number of resolvable beamspots at 3 dB separation is derived
analytically, exhibiting a linear dependence on the array aperture. Finally,
the number of significant singular values of a channel observed at the array's
broadside is estimated, showing a power-law dependence on the aperture. The
resulting expressions provide practical design guidelines for evaluating
aperture requirements in near-field communication and sensing applications.

Abstract: We consider resource allocation problems in multi-user wireless networks,
where the goal is to optimize a network-wide utility function subject to
constraints on the ergodic average performance of users. We demonstrate how a
state-augmented graph neural network (GNN) parametrization for the resource
allocation policy circumvents the drawbacks of the ubiquitous dual subgradient
methods by representing the network configurations (or states) as graphs and
viewing dual variables as dynamic inputs to the model, viewed as graph signals
supported over the graphs. Lagrangian maximizing state-augmented policies are
learned during the offline training phase, and the dual variables evolve
through gradient updates while executing the learned state-augmented policies
during the inference phase. Our main contributions are to illustrate how
near-optimal initialization of dual multipliers for faster inference can be
accomplished with dual variable regression, leveraging a secondary GNN
parametrization, and how maximization of the Lagrangian over the multipliers
sampled from the dual descent dynamics substantially improves the training of
state-augmented models. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
algorithm with extensive numerical experiments in a case study of transmit
power control. Finally, we prove a convergence result and an exponential
probability bound on the excursions of the dual function (iterate) optimality
gaps.

Motivation: 无小区大规模MIMO网络中，由于前传链路带宽有限，传统的信道估计与数据检测方法面临挑战，尤其是在用户数量不断增加的情况下。

Method: 提出基于变分贝叶斯（VB）推断的JED方法，比较了Q-E（先量化后估计）和E-Q（先估计后量化）两种策略。

Result: VB(Q-E)和VB(E-Q)方法在符号错误率（SER）、信道估计的归一化均方误差（NMSE）、计算复杂度和前传开销等方面均优于LMMSE方法，且VB(Q-E)表现更优。

Conclusion: 基于VB的方法在低分辨率量化信号下仍能实现高性能，VB(Q-E)因其避免了本地信道估计误差而表现更佳。

Abstract: We study the joint channel estimation and data detection (JED) problem in a
cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) network, where
access points (APs) communicate with a central processing unit (CPU) over
fronthaul links. However, the bandwidth of these links is limited, and thus,
presents challenges to the applicability of CF-mMIMO, especially with an
ever-increasing number of users. To address this, we propose a method based on
variational Bayesian (VB) inference for performing the JED process, where the
APs forward low-resolution quantized versions of the signals to the CPU. We
consider two approaches: \emph{quantization-and-estimation} (Q-E) and
\emph{estimation-and-quantization} (E-Q). In the Q-E approach, each AP uses a
low-bit quantizer to quantize the signal before forwarding it to the CPU, while
in the E-Q approach, each AP first performs local channel estimation and then
sends a low-bit quantized version of the estimated channel to the CPU. We
evaluate the performance of our VB-based approach under perfect fronthaul link
(PFL) with unquantized received signals, Q-E, and E-Q in terms of symbol error
rate (SER), normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the channel estimation,
computational complexity, and fronthaul signaling overhead. We also compare
these results with those of the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE)
method under the PFL scenario. Our numerical results show that both the VB(Q-E)
and VB(E-Q) approaches achieve superior performance compared to LMMSE(PFL),
benefiting from the nonlinear modeling inherent in VB. Furthermore, the VB(Q-E)
method outperforms VB(E-Q) due to errors in the local channel estimation
process at the APs within the VB(E-Q) approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a laser-based optical wireless communication
(OWC) system employing a 940 nm single-mode (SM) vertical cavity surface
emitting laser (VCSEL) and a multi-mode (MM) fiber-coupled receiver, achieving
a record data rate beyond 70 Gb/s, while the optical transmit power is below 5
mW. The use of a high speed fiber-optic photoreceiver avoids limiting the
communication bandwidth by the receiver, enabling ultra-high capacity and
energy-efficient light fidelity (LiFi) links to unlock new applications. This
work experimentally validates the feasibility of ultra-high speed indoor OWC
systems using a single low-power and low-cost VCSEL for next-generation LiFi
connectivity.
