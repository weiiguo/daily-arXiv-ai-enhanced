We refer\nto this novel computational paradigm as AirFC. We first study the case in which\nthe precoder, combiner, and RIS phase shift matrices are jointly optimized to\nminimize the mismatch between the OAC system and the target FC layer. To solve\nthis non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity alternating\noptimization algorithm, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all\noptimization variables are derived. Next, we consider training of the system\nparameters using two distinct learning strategies, namely centralized training\nand distributed training. In the centralized training approach, training is\nperformed at either the transmitter or the receiver, whichever possesses the\nchannel state information (CSI), and the trained parameters are provided to the\nother terminal. In the distributed training approach, the transmitter and\nreceiver iteratively update their parameters through back and forth\ntransmissions by leveraging channel reciprocity, thereby avoiding CSI\nacquisition and significantly reducing computational complexity. Subsequently,\nwe extend our analysis to a multi-RIS scenario by exploiting its spatial\ndiversity gain to enhance the system performance. Simulation results show that\nthe AirFC system realized by the RIS-aided MIMO configuration achieves\nsatisfactory classification accuracy."}

To prevent\nunauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal\nby convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters\nthe channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this\nstrategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying\nsingle-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel\nidentification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna\nreceivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization\nregardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of\nsignal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization\nperformance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical\ntriangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to\ndemonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy\nof users from adversarial radio-based localization systems."}

The goal for the nodes is to remain as\nfresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we\nassess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart\nmechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip\n(RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that\nneed it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number\nof fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System\n(SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we\npresent an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based\napproach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness\nof nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared\nto traditional gossiping techniques."}
