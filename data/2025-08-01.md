### [1] [A CPFSK Transceiver with Hybrid CSS-DSSS Spreading for LPWAN PHY Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23029)
*Wenkun Wen,Ruiqi Zhang,Peiran Wu,Tierui Min,Minghua Xia*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种新型LPWAN收发器，通过CSS前导和CPFSK调制实现高接收灵敏度和低复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LPWAN收发器在覆盖范围和数据速率之间存在权衡，需要一种兼顾高灵敏度和低复杂度的解决方案。

Method: 采用CSS前导简化同步，结合CPFSK和DSSS提高覆盖范围和扩频增益，接收端使用双峰检测和非相干解调方案。

Result: 仿真和实地测试表明，该收发器在接收灵敏度和复杂度上优于传统方案。

Conclusion: 新型收发器为LPWAN提供了一种高性能且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) transceivers typically
compromise data rates to achieve deep coverage. This paper presents a novel
transceiver that achieves high receiver sensitivity and low computational
complexity. At the transmitter, we replace the conventional direct sequence
spread spectrum (DSSS) preamble with a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) preamble,
consisting of a pair of down-chirp and up-chirp signals that are conjugate to
each other, simplifying packet synchronization. For enhanced coverage, the
payload incorporates continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) to
maintain a constant envelope and phase continuity, in conjunction with DSSS to
achieve a high spreading gain. At the receiver, we develop a double-peak
detection method to improve synchronization and a non-coherent joint
despreading and demodulation scheme that increases receiver sensitivity while
maintaining simplicity in implementation. Furthermore, we optimize the preamble
detection threshold and spreading sequences for maximum non-coherent receiver
performance. The software-defined radio (SDR) prototype, developed using GNU
Radio and USRP, along with operational snapshots, showcases its practical
engineering applications. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and field-test
trials demonstrate that our transceiver outperforms traditional ones in terms
of receiver sensitivity, while also being low in complexity and cost-effective
for LPWAN requirements.

### [2] [Optimal compressed sensing for mixing stochastic processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23175)
*Yonatan Gutman,Adam Śpiewak*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文证明了在压缩感知中，平均信息维度是恢复ψ*-混合过程的精确阈值，低于此阈值时几乎无损恢复是不可能的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究压缩感知中随机线性测量的数量与信号恢复能力之间的关系，明确平均信息维度的作用。

Method: 引入相关维度率作为下界，结合几何测度理论技术分析压缩感知的极限。

Result: 平均信息维度是压缩感知的精确阈值，低于此阈值时几乎无损恢复不可行。

Conclusion: 平均信息维度是压缩感知中的基本限制，为相关领域提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Jalali and Poor introduced an asymptotic framework for compressed sensing of
stochastic processes, demonstrating that any rate strictly greater than the
mean information dimension serves as an upper bound on the number of random
linear measurements required for (universal) almost lossless recovery of
$\psi^*$-mixing processes, as measured in the normalized $L^2$ norm. In this
work, we show that if the normalized number of random linear measurements is
strictly less than the mean information dimension, then almost lossless
recovery of a $\psi^*$-mixing process is impossible by any sequence of
decompressors. This establishes the mean information dimension as the
fundamental limit for compressed sensing in this setting (and, in fact, the
precise threshold for the problem). To this end, we introduce a new quantity,
related to techniques from geometric measure theory: the correlation dimension
rate, which is shown to be a lower bound for compressed sensing of arbitrary
stationary stochastic processes.

### [3] [The Construction of Near-optimal Universal Coding of Integers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23180)
*Wei Yan,Yunghsiang S. Han*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种近乎最优的通用整数编码（UCI）方法，称为ν码，其最小扩展因子为2.0386，缩小了最优UCI的最小扩展因子范围。同时，还构造了一种新的UCI方法Δδ码，并证明其与ν码在最小扩展因子方面是目前最优的。此外，还证明了最优UCI的最小扩展因子下界为2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通用整数编码（UCI）的最小扩展因子，以优化压缩性能。

Method: 提出ν码和Δδ码两种新的UCI方法，并通过理论分析证明其最优性。

Result: ν码的最小扩展因子为2.0386，缩小了最优UCI的最小扩展因子范围（2≤C_C*≤2.0386）。Δδ码和ν码是目前最优的UCI方法。

Conclusion: ν码和Δδ码在最小扩展因子方面表现优异，为最优UCI提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Universal Coding of Integers (UCI) is suitable for discrete memoryless
sources with unknown probability distributions and infinitely countable
alphabet sizes. The UCI is a class of prefix codes, such that the ratio of the
average codeword length to $\max\{1, H(P)\}$ is within a constant expansion
factor $K_{\mathcal{C}}$ for any decreasing probability distribution $P$, where
$H(P)$ is the entropy of $P$. For any UCI code $\mathcal{C}$, define \emph{the
minimum expansion factor} $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ to represent the infimum of the
set of extension factors of $\mathcal{C}$. Each $\mathcal{C}$ has a unique
corresponding $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$, and the smaller $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ is,
the better the compression performance of $\mathcal{C}$ is. A class of UCI
$\mathcal{C}$ (or family $\{\mathcal{C}_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$) achieving the
smallest $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ is defined as the \emph{optimal UCI}. The best
result currently is that the range of $C_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ for the optimal UCI
is $2\leq C_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}\leq 2.5$. In this paper, we prove that there
exists a class of near-optimal UCIs, called $\nu$ code, to achieve
$K_\nu=2.0386$. This narrows the range of the minimum expansion factor for
optimal UCI to $2\leq C_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}\leq 2.0386$. Another new class of
UCI, called $\Delta\delta$ code, is specifically constructed. We show that the
$\Delta\delta$ code and $\nu$ code are currently optimal in terms of minimum
expansion factor. In addition, we propose a new proof that shows the minimum
expansion factor of the optimal UCI is lower bounded by $2$.

Conclusion: ZC序列的DFT可通过微频跳模式高效计算，揭示了其与微频跳符号的深层联系。

Abstract: Having established that Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences are inherently linear
micro-frequency hopping (lmFH) symbols, this paper first presents an intuitive
and visual exposition of the computation of the DFT and IDFT of ZC sequences
using the lmFH pattern. This yields interesting results. Subsequently, an
alternative form for computing the cumulative sum of ZC sequences using the
Generalized Quadratic Gauss Sum is introduced. Furthermore, building on the
micro-frequency hopping (mFH) concept, this paper shows that the DFT of ZC
sequences can be transformed into an lmFH symbol with frequency shift and phase
offset. Therefore, the DFT of ZC sequences can be computed via cumulative
frequency points, similar to the computation of normal mFH symbols.

### [5] [Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks: Stochastic Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23234)
*Marziyeh Soltani,Mahtab Mirmohseni,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文分析了多输入多输出（MIMO）集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统在下行链路场景中的随机安全性能，考虑了通信和感知的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在随机网络中如何同时实现通信、感知目标位置和对抗窃听威胁的安全性能。

Method: 推导了遍历保密率（ESR）和遍历Cramer-Rao下界（CRB），利用中心极限定理计算SNR和CRB的概率密度函数。

Result: 分析了CRB-保密率区域的边界，揭示了通信与感知之间的性能权衡。

Conclusion: 在随机ISAC网络中，可以平衡通信和感知性能，同时保障安全和隐私。

Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a
downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to
simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and
counteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive
single-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as
well as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's
location. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays
the role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers
channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly
distributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the
ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for
target localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves
computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. We
characterize the boundary of the CRB-secrecy rate region, and interpret the
performance tradeoffs between communication and sensing while guaranteeing a
level of security and privacy in the random ISAC networks.

Further, we extend it to a general multi-user scenario, and also propose an
element position optimization scheme according to the derived performance
expressions. Finally, simulation results confirm that the movement of IRS
elements can improve the communication rate and the sensing accuracy, and
especially broaden the coverage of ISAC.

Conclusion: 该框架和SEM指标为动态卫星通信网络提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As satellite communications play an increasingly important role in future
wireless networks, the issue of limited link budget in satellite systems has
attracted significant attention in current research. Although semantic
communications emerge as a promising solution to address these constraints, it
introduces the challenge of increased computational resource consumption in
wireless communications. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-layer
hybrid bit and generative semantic communication framework which can adapt to
the dynamic satellite communication networks. Furthermore, to balance the
semantic communication efficiency and performance in satellite-to-ground
transmissions, we introduce a novel semantic communication efficiency metric
(SEM) that evaluates the trade-offs among latency, computational consumption,
and semantic reconstruction quality in the proposed framework. Moreover, we
utilize a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to optimize the resource allocation in the proposed
network. Simulation results demonstrate the flexibility of our proposed
transmission framework and the effectiveness of the proposed metric SEM,
illustrate the relationships among various semantic communication metrics.

### [8] [From Link Diversity to Cross-Band Feedback Collaboration: A New Perspective on Hybrid Optical-RF Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23686)
*Menghan Li,Yulin Shao,Runxin Zhang,Lu Lu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的混合光-射频（O-RF）系统架构O-RF-CBF，利用光下行链路反馈优化射频上行链路的编码策略，实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为混合光-射频系统主要用于链路多样性，而本文发现光链路可以作为功能性的上行链路可靠性增强工具。

Method: 提出O-RF-CBF架构，利用光下行链路反馈指导射频上行链路的自适应编码。

Result: 数值结果显示，O-RF-CBF比传统O-RF系统显著提高了上行链路吞吐量。

Conclusion: 跨频段协作而非冗余是释放混合无线网络潜力的关键。

Abstract: We suggest a re-examination of the conventional view that hybrid
optical-radio frequency (O-RF) systems are primarily diversity-driven networks
that switch between RF and optical links for robustness. Instead, we uncover a
new architectural opportunity: repurposing the optical downlink to enable
real-time feedback channel coding over the RF uplink, where structured decoder
feedback is delivered from the access point to guide the transmitter's coding
strategy. This insight marks a conceptual paradigm shift from passive link
diversity to active cross-band collaboration, where the wideband,
interference-free optical wireless communication (OWC) is no longer merely a
downlink backup but a functional enabler of uplink reliability. To realize this
vision, we propose a novel architecture, O-RF with Cross-Band Feedback
(O-RF-CBF), that exploits the optical downlink feedback to facilitate adaptive
RF uplink coding. Numerical results reveal that O-RF-CBF achieves significant
uplink throughput gains over traditional O-RF systems. Our findings highlight
that inter-band synergy, not redundancy, is the key to unlocking the full
potential of hybrid wireless networks.

*Duc Thien Hua,Mohammadali Mohammadi,Hien Quoc Ngo,Michail Matthaiou*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了在无小区大规模MIMO系统中集成超对角可重构智能表面（BDRIS）以增强同时无线信息和能量传输（SWIPT），提出了优化算法并展示了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在不牺牲时频资源的情况下同时支持能量接收器（ERs）和信息接收器（IRs），需要一种高效的系统设计和优化方法。

Method: 采用保护性部分零强制预编码技术，结合启发式搜索、连续凸近似和深度强化学习方法，优化AP选择、功率控制和BDRIS散射矩阵设计。

Result: 数值结果表明，BDRIS在能量收集方面显著优于传统对角RIS，启发式散射矩阵设计使平均能量收集量提升高达七倍。

Conclusion: BDRIS在无小区大规模MIMO系统中具有显著优势，为SWIPT提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output
(CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy
receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time
frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving
ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A
protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs
to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently,
closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average
sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive
optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power
control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term
statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then
effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems,
efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the
scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep
reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power
control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully
connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the
conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in
the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix
design is employed.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段感知框架，用于解决异构混合模拟-数字H2AD MIMO架构中多发射源数量和方向估计的难题，包括三种目标数量感知方法和一种低复杂度高精度的DOA估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模全数字MIMO架构面临的高能耗、高电路成本和高复杂度问题，同时解决H2AD MIMO架构中多发射源数量和方向智能感知的难题。

Method: 提出两阶段感知框架：1）三种目标数量感知方法（改进的EDC框架、基于统计特征的增强DNN、利用全特征值的改进1D-CNN）；2）低复杂度高精度的OMC-DOA方法进行DOA估计。

Result: 仿真结果显示，三种目标数量感知方法在中高信噪比下实现100%目标数量感知，改进的1D-CNN在极低信噪比下表现优异；OMC-DOA在多源环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了H2AD MIMO架构中的多发射源感知问题，为未来无线网络提供了绿色高效的解决方案。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

Rydberg radar, and quantum space communications. Practical challenges, such as
limited instantaneous bandwidth and nonlinear distortion, are identified. To
address these issues, mitigation strategies and future research directions are
also outlined, supporting the advancement of RAR-aided wireless systems.

### [12] [Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057)
*Triet M. Tran,Sina Khanmohammadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析脑肿瘤患者术前fMRI数据中的高阶脑交互能量特征，发现这些特征与术后工作记忆下降相关，并能高精度预测认知风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤手术可能导致术后认知功能障碍，研究旨在探索术前神经动力学变化与术后工作记忆下降的关系。

Method: 使用fMRI提取术前高阶脑交互能量特征，结合统计和机器学习（随机森林）模型分析其与术后工作记忆表现的关系。

Result: 术后工作记忆较低的患者表现出更少但更极端的能量转换，而较高分患者则相反。能量特征预测术后记忆下降的准确率达90%。

Conclusion: 术前高阶神经动力学特征可预测术后工作记忆下降，为个性化手术规划和干预提供依据。

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成扩散模型的环境感知跨基站CKM推断方法BS-1-to-N，通过BS位置嵌入和注意力机制实现高效推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在分布式节点架构中构建CKM成本高昂，而BS-1-to-N方法利用无线环境的共享特性，实现高效推断。

Conclusion: 该方法通过挖掘CKM与BS位置的隐含关联，为基站部署优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) inference across base stations (BSs) is the key
to achieving efficient environmentaware communications. This paper proposes an
environmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the
generative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location
embedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS
location information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the
cross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to
respectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as
that among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target
BSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM
inference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.
Specifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free
networks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM
construction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N
model is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any
potential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by
exploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same
wireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to
multi-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same
wireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit
correlation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the
proposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We
provide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N
generative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to
demonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a
promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling
flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the
interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave
reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at
one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local
control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further
enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,
channel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among
non-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of
NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices
communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure
transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses
signal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a
physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural
scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,
the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate
an all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization
algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS
consistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal
(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two
impinging and reflection directions need to be supported. By analyzing the
power of signals from all other users and the beampatterns, we show that secure
transmission can be achieved.

Result: 常用操作码执行时间减少61%-99%，区块执行速度提升6倍。

Conclusion: EVMx架构能显著加速智能合约执行，提升EVM兼容区块链性能。

Abstract: Ethereum blockchain uses smart contracts (SCs) to implement decentralized
applications (dApps). SCs are executed by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)
running within an Ethereum client. Moreover, the EVM has been widely adopted by
other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and
more. However, the EVM performance is limited by the constraints of the
general-purpose computer it operates on. This work proposes offloading SC
execution onto a dedicated hardware-based EVM. Specifically, EVMx is an
FPGA-based SC execution engine that benefits from the inherent parallelism and
high-speed processing capabilities of a hardware architecture. Synthesis
results demonstrate a reduction in execution time of 61% to 99% for commonly
used operation codes compared to CPU-based SC execution environments. Moreover,
the execution time of Ethereum blocks on EVMx is up to 6x faster compared to
analogous works in the literature. These results highlight the potential of the
proposed architecture to accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of
EVM-compatible blockchains.

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to adopt extremely
large aperture arrays (ELAAs), novel antenna architectures, and operate in
extremely high-frequency bands to meet growing data demands. ELAAs
significantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial
resolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift
communication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where
spherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle
and distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel
estimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field
scenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel
estimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an
electromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences,
alongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream
near-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major
estimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations
(single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and
RIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among
estimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide
insights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel
estimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research
directions.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless
networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and
achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into
interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and
extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of
the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of
sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions.
Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or
user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the
network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also
have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate
maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable
transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably
optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification
for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable
rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an
alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO
literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the
beamforming strategy.

Result: 实验验证了MPGFRFT在多种图信号处理任务中的优越性能。

Conclusion: MPGFRFT框架具有灵活性和高性能，适用于图像加密等应用。

Abstract: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) applies a single global
fractional order to all graph frequencies, which restricts its adaptability to
diverse signal characteristics across the spectral domain. To address this
limitation, in this paper, we propose two types of multiple-parameter GFRFTs
(MPGFRFTs) and establish their corresponding theoretical frameworks. We design
a spectral compression strategy tailored for ultra-low compression ratios,
effectively preserving essential information even under extreme dimensionality
reduction. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a learnable order vector scheme
that enables adaptive compression and denoising, demonstrating strong
performance on both graph signals and images. We explore the application of
MPGFRFTs to image encryption and decryption. Experimental results validate the
versatility and superior performance of the proposed MPGFRFT framework across
various graph signal processing tasks.

Abstract: Real-time transmission of high-resolution video signals in an uncompressed
and unencrypted format requires an ultra-reliable and low-latency
communications (URLLC) medium with high bandwidth to maintain the quality of
experience (QoE) for users. We put forward the design and experimental
demonstration of a high-performance laser-based optical wireless communication
(OWC) system that enables high-definition (HD) video transmission with
submillisecond latencies. The serial digital interface (SDI) output of a camera
is used to transmit the live video stream over an optical wireless link by
directly modulating the SDI signal on the intensity of a 940 nm vertical cavity
surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The proposed SDI over light fidelity (LiFi)
system corroborates error-free transmission of full HD (FHD) and 4K
ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions at data rates of 2.97 Gb/s and 5.94
Gb/s, respectively, with a measured end-to-end latency of under 35 ns. Since
SDI standards support various video formats and VCSELs are high-bandwidth and
low-power devices, this presents a scalable and inexpensive solution for
wireless connectivity between professional broadcast equipment using
off-the-shelf SDI components.
