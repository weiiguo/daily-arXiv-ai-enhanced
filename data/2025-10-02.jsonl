However,\nthe complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG\nsignals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural\nstates, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective\ncross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover\ncomplementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight,\nwe propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a\nunified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable\nconversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the\nfirst cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model\ndemonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible,\nopen-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering\nvaluable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of\ngeneral-purpose EEG models."}

These measurements are vital for understanding radio channel\nproperties in diverse environments, and involve time-consuming and expensive\ncampaigns. A major challenge for the effective utilization of propagation\nmeasurement data has been the lack of a standardized format for reporting and\narchiving results. Although organizations such as NIST, NGA, and 3GPP have made\ncommendable efforts for data pooling, a unified machine-readable data format\nfor consolidating measurements across different institutions and frequencies\nremains a missing piece in advancing global standardization efforts. This paper\nintroduces a standardized point-data format for radio propagation measurements\nand demonstrates how institutions may merge disparate campaigns into a common\nformat. This data format, alongside an environmental map and a measurement\nsummary metadata table, enables integration of data from disparate sources by\nusing a structured representation of key parameters. Here, we show the efficacy\nof the point-data format standard using data gathered from two independent\nsub-THz urban microcell (UMi) campaigns: 142 GHz measurements at New York\nUniversity (NYU) and 145 GHz measurements at the University of Southern\nCalifornia (USC). A joint path loss analysis using the close-in path loss model\n(1 m ref. distance) yields a refined estimate of the path loss exponent (PLE)\nemploying the proposed standard to pool measurements. Other statistics such as\nRMS delay spread and angular spread are also determined using a joint\npoint-data table. Adopting this simple, unified format will accelerate channel\nmodel development, build multi-institutional datasets, and feed AI/ML\napplications with reliable training data in a common format from many sources."}
