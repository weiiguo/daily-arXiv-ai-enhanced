Guessing decoding, which infers the noise or codeword candidate in order of decreasing (exact or approximate) likelihood, offers a universal framework applicable to short codes. In this paper, we present a unified treatment of two prominent recent families of guessing decoding: guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) and guessing codeword decoding (GCD). For each, we (i) present algorithmic implementations and ordering strategies; (ii) prove maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality under appropriate stopping criteria; (iii) derive saddle-point approximations for the average number of queries; and (iv) validate theoretical predictions with simulations. We further analyze the performance degradation due to limited search budgets relative to ML performance, compare key metrics (worst-case and average complexity, hardware considerations), and highlight how advances in one approach transfer naturally to the other. Our results clarify the operating regimes where GRAND and GCD demonstrate superior performance. This work provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for deploying universal guessing decoders in next-generation short-blocklength communications."}

Rashmi"], "title": "Tight Lower Bounds on the Bandwidth Cost of MDS Convertible Codes in the Split Regime", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in erasure coding for distributed storage systems have demonstrated that adapting redundancy to varying disk failure rates can lead to substantial storage savings. Such adaptation requires code conversion, wherein data encoded under an initial $[k^I + r^I, k^I]$ code is transformed into data encoded under a final $[k^F + r^F, k^F]$ code - an operation that can be resource-intensive. Convertible codes are a class of codes designed to facilitate this transformation efficiently while preserving desirable properties such as the MDS property. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits on the bandwidth cost of conversion (total amount of data transferred between the storage nodes during conversion) for systematic MDS convertible codes. Specifically, we study the subclass of conversions known as the split regime (a single initial codeword is converted into multiple final codewords).\n  In this setting, prior to this work, the best known lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of conversion for all parameters were derived by Maturana and Rashmi under certain uniformity assumptions on the number of symbols downloaded from each node. Further, these bounds were shown to be tight for the parameter regime where $r^F \\geq k^F$ or $r^I \\leq r^F$. In this work, we derive lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of systematic MDS convertible codes for all parameters in the split regime without the uniformity assumption. Moreover, our bounds are tight for the broader parameter regime where $r^F \\geq k^F$ or $r^I \\leq k^F$. Subsequently, our bounds also partially resolve the conjecture proposed by Maturana and Rashmi. We employ a novel information-theoretic framework, which assumes only that the initial and final codes are systematic and does not rely on any linearity assumptions or the aforementioned uniformity assumptions."}

However, this transition is hindered by fundamental limitations in conventional metasurface transmitter architectures, including restricted modulation orders, symbol-level spatial inconsistency, and significant harmonic interference. These issues stem from the intrinsic coupling between baseband signal processing and radio-frequency beamforming in monolithic designs reliant on simplistic switching mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel metasurface-enabled superheterodyne architecture (MSA) that fundamentally decouples these functionalities. The MSA introduces a dual-stage up-conversion process, comprising a digital up-conversion module for in-phase/quadrature modulation and baseband-to-intermediate frequency conversion, a precoder module for precoding, and a custom-designed magnitude-phase-decoupled metasurface that acts as a reconfigurable reflective mixer array. This decoupling of harmonic-free waveform generation from spatial precoding overcomes the critical drawbacks of existing approaches. Experimental results from a 5.8 GHz proof-of-concept prototype system validate the MSA's superior performance. The system generates spatially isotropic constellations for arbitrary-order QAM modulations, ensures consistent time-frequency signatures for applications like Doppler-spoofing, and achieves data rates up to 20 Mbps within a linear operating region that minimizes nonlinear distortion. The capability of employing spatial diversity and multi-stream interference cancellation has been demonstrated for the first time in a PM-based transmitter."}

Because empirical statistics are not directly applicable in this regime, obtaining regret guarantees for batch learning has long posed a fundamental challenge. We propose a natural criterion based on leave-one-out regret and analyze its minimax value for several hypothesis classes. For the multinomial simplex over $m$ symbols, we show that the minimax regret is $\\frac{m-1}{N} + o\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)$, and compare it to the stochastic realizable case where it is $\\frac{m-1}{2N} + o\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)$. More generally, we prove that every hypothesis class of VC dimension $d$ is learnable in the individual batch-learning problem, with regret at most $\\frac{d\\log(N)}{N} + o\\!\\left(\\frac{\\log(N)}{N}\\right)$, and we establish matching lower bounds for certain classes. We further derive additional upper bounds that depend on structural properties of the hypothesis class.

The metric characterizing false alarms is the probability of a false alarm occurring before the horizon ends. The metric that characterizes the delay is \\emph{latency}, which is the smallest value such that the probability that detection delay exceeds this value is upper bounded to a predetermined latency level. The objective is to minimize the latency (at a given latency level), while maintaining a low false alarm probability. Under the pre-specified latency and false alarm levels, a universal lower bound on the latency, which any change detection procedure needs to satisfy, is derived. Change detectors are then developed, which are order-optimal in terms of the horizon. The case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known is considered first, and then the results are generalized to the non-parametric case when they are unknown except that they are sub-Gaussian with different means.

This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple pixel antennas. We aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of this MIMO system by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the antenna coders at both the transmitter and the receiver. This problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is non-convex and particularly challenging to solve due to the binary-valued optimization variables corresponding to the antenna coders. We first propose an exhaustive search based method to obtain the optimal solution to this problem, which corresponds to the fundamental capacity limit. Then, we propose a branch-and-bound based iterative algorithm aiming to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with lower complexity than exhaustive search as the number of pixel ports becomes large. Finally, we devise an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity.

Subsequently, we design two matched-filtering sensing algorithms. The first is performed in the time-frequency domain with low complexity, while the second is operated in the DD-DAFT domain to precisely resolve the DD coupling.

We propose a low-complexity iterative node selection algorithm that exploits the spatial diversity of subnetwork deployments and dynamically refines the set of sensing subnetworks to maximize localization accuracy under tight resource constraints. Simulation results show that our method achieves sub-7 cm accuracy in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels within only three iterations, yielding over 97% improvement compared to the best-performing benchmark under the same sensing budget. We further demonstrate that increasing spatial diversity through additional antennas and subnetworks enhances sensing robustness, especially in fading channels. Finally, we quantify the sensing-communication trade-off, showing that reducing sensing iterations and the number of sensing subnetworks improves throughput at the cost of reduced localization precision."}

This will push their operation into the near field where far-field beam management degrades and beam training becomes more costly and must be done more frequently. Because ELAA training and data transmission consume energy and training trades off with service time, we pose a cross-layer control problem that couples PHY-layer beam management with MAC-layer service under delay-sensitive traffic. The controller decides when to retrain and how aggressively to train (pilot count and sparsity) while allocating transmit power, explicitly balancing pilot overhead, data-phase rate, and energy to reduce the queueing delay of MAC-layer frames/packets to be transmitted. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and solve it with deep reinforcement learning. In simulations with a realistic near-field channel and varying mobility and traffic load, the learned policy outperforms strong 5G-NR--style baselines at a comparable energy: it achieves 85.5% higher throughput than DFT sweeping and reduces the overflow rate by 78%. These results indicate a practical path to overhead-aware, traffic-adaptive near-field beam management with implications for emerging low-latency, high-rate next-generation applications such as digital twin, spatial computing, and immersive communication."}

This paper presents a lightweight deep learning-based denoising framework, forming a compact autoencoder architecture. The model was trained under severe noise conditions (-5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) using a rigorously partitioned dataset to ensure no data leakage and robust generalization. Extensive evaluations were conducted across seven noise configurations and three SNR levels (-5 dB, 0 dB, and +5 dB), showing consistent denoising performance with minimal morphological distortion, critical for maintaining diagnostic integrity. In particular, tests on clinically vital rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) confirm that the proposed model effectively suppresses noise without altering arrhythmic features essential for diagnosis. Visual and quantitative assessments, including SNR improvement, RMSE, and correlation metrics, validate the model's efficacy in preserving waveform fidelity. To demonstrate real-world applicability, the model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 using TensorFlow Lite with float16 precision. Inference latency was measured at just 1.41 seconds per 14-second ECG segment, indicating feasibility for near-real-time use in edge devices. Overall, this study introduces a lightweight, hardware-validated, and morphologically reliable ECG denoising solution suitable for integration into portable or wearable healthcare systems."}

This spectral non-uniformity directly induces severe distortion in the target's HRRP, consequently compromising the performance and reliability of conventional HRRP-based target recognition methods. This paper proposes a novel, end-to-end trained network for robust radar target recognition. The core of our model is a CFA module that operates directly on the complex spectrum of the received echo. The CFA module learns to generate an adaptive frequency-domain filter, assigning lower weights to bands corrupted by strong jamming while preserving critical target information in cleaner bands. The filtered spectrum is then fed into a classifier backbone for recognition. Experimental results on simulated HRRP data with various jamming combinations demonstrate our method's superiority. Notably, under severe jamming conditions, our model achieves a recognition accuracy nearly 9% higher than traditional model-based approaches, all while introducing negligible computational overhead. This highlights its exceptional performance and robustness in challenging jamming environments."}

In this letter, we propose a Slepian-based amplitude tapering approach that maximizes mainlobe energy concentration, achieving significant sidelobe reduction in both dimensions.

This work investigates whether such enhanced angular coverage translates into improved spatial multiplexing performance when compared to uniform linear arrays (ULAs). To more accurately delineate the effective near field region, we introduce the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD), an angle dependent metric that bounds the spatial region where beamfocusing remains effective. Closed form expressions for both beamdepth and EBRD are derived for UCAs. Our analysis shows that, under a fixed antenna element count, ULAs achieve narrower beamdepth and a longer EBRD than UCAs. Conversely, under a fixed aperture length, UCAs provide slightly narrower beamdepth and a marginally longer EBRD. Simulation results further confirm that ULAs achieve higher sum rate under the fixed element constraint, while UCAs offer marginal performance gain under the fixed aperture constraint."}

A complete signal processing chain is proposed and developed, encompassing synchronization, user identification, and localization, all executed onboard UAV during flight. The system autonomously plans and adapts its mission workflow to estimate multiple user positions within a single deployment, integrating flight control with real-time sensing. Extensive simulations and a full-scale low- altitude experimental campaign validate the approach, showing localization errors below 3 m in rural field tests and below 8 m in urban simulation scenarios, while reliably identifying each user.

Under a general Ricean fading channel model, a closed-form analytical expression for the average spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by PAs is first derived. Based on this, a sum-SE maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the primary and secondary pinching beamforming, subject to system constraints on the transmission power budgets, minimum antenna separation requirements, and feasible PA deployment regions. To address this non-convex problem, a three-stage optimization algorithm is developed to sequentially optimize both the PT and ST pinching beamforming, and the ST power control. For the PT and ST pinching beamforming optimization, the coarse positions of PA are first determined at the waveguide-level. Then, wavelength-level refinements achieve constructive signal combination at the intended user and destructive superposition at the unintended user. For the ST power control, a closed-form solution is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that i) PAs can achieve significant SE improvements over conventional fixed-position antennas; ii) the proposed pinching beamforming design achieves effective interference suppression and superior performance for both even and odd numbers of PAs; and iii) the developed three-stage optimization algorithm enables nearly orthogonal transmission between the primary and secondary networks."}

The security of a rotatable array system is investigated in this paper. A dual-base-station (BS) architecture is adopted, in which the BSs collaboratively perform integrated sensing of the eavesdropper (the target) and communication tasks. To address the security challenge when the sensing target is located on the main communication link, the problem of maximizing the secrecy rate (SR) under sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirements and discrete constraints is formulated. This problem involves the joint optimization of the array pose, the antenna distribution on the array surface, the multi-layer transmitting RIS phase matrices, and the beamforming matrices, which is non-convex. To solve this challenge, an two-stage online algorithm based on the generalized Rayleigh quotient and an offline algorithm based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient are proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Compared to conventional schemes without array pose adjustment, the proposed approach achieves approximately 22\\% improvement in SR.

We aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of this MIMO system by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the antenna coders at both the transmitter and the receiver. This problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is non-convex and particularly challenging to solve due to the binary-valued optimization variables corresponding to the antenna coders.
