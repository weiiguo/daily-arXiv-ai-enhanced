### [1] [A Remark on the AAA Method for Secret-Key Generation in Mobile Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05801)
*Yingbo Hua*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AAA方法是一种广泛适用的密钥生成方法，具有累积性、适应性和可加性。论文展示了其性能的鲁棒性，并比较了AAA方法与理想方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AAA方法在密钥生成中的鲁棒性和性能优势，尤其是在存在相关性和泄漏的情况下。

Method: 通过理论分析，验证AAA方法在无限叠加情况下密钥的完美性，并与基于互易信道估计的理想方法进行比较。

Result: AAA方法在无限叠加时密钥的保密性趋于完美，且相比理想方法具有多项优势。

Conclusion: AAA方法在密钥生成中表现出鲁棒性和优越性，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: A broadly applicable method for secret-key generation is named for its
accumulative, adaptable and additive (AAA) properties. This paper first shows a
robustness of its performance. Namely, even if there is an inter correlation or
a leakage caused intra correlation among the superimposed packets, provided
there is a nonzero probability for each packet to be missed in full or in part
by Eve, then the equivocation of the key generated by the AAA method always
becomes perfect as the number of superpositions becomes infinite. Also shown in
this paper is a comparison between the AAA method and an ideal method based on
reciprocal channel estimation, which reveals several advantages of the AAA
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨一种无需量子通道的秘密信息传输方法，以克服QKD的高成本和复杂性。

Method: 通过回显加密探针（STEEP）实现秘密信息传输，仅需经典或非量子通道。

Result: STEEP在多种实际场景（如空中或海底光缆）中能提供足够的保密速率，支持一次性密码加密。

Conclusion: STEEP在成本、复杂性、兼容性和抗窃听方面优于QKD，是一种可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Secret-message transmission by echoing encrypted probes (STEEP) is discussed
as an alternative to quantum key distribution (QKD). The former only needs
classic or non-quantum channels while the latter needs both quantum and classic
channels for secret-key generation. STEEP is shown to yield a secrecy rate
sufficient for one-time pads encryption in many practical situations including
in-air channels or undersea optical cables. Other advantages of STEEP over QKD
include cost, complexity, compatibility, and robustness against constant
eavesdropping.

### [3] [IRS-Assisted IoT Activity Detection Under Asynchronous Transmission and Heterogeneous Powers: Detectors and Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05959)
*Amirhossein Taherpour,Somayeh Khani,Abbas Taherpour,Tamer Khattab*

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 提出的框架在理论和实践之间架起桥梁，为6G系统中的IRS辅助物联网网络提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of activity detection in distributed
Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where devices employ asynchronous
transmissions with heterogeneous power levels to report their local
observations. The system leverages an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to
enhance detection reliability, with optional incorporation of a direct
line-of-sight (LoS) path. We formulate the detection problem as a binary
hypothesis test and develop four detectors: an optimal detector alongside three
computationally efficient detectors designed for practical scenarios with
different levels of prior knowledge about noise variance, channel state
information, and device transmit powers. For each detector, we derive
closed-form expressions for both detection and false alarm probabilities,
establishing theoretical performance benchmarks. Extensive simulations validate
our analytical results and systematically evaluate the impact of key system
parameters including the number of antennas, samples, users, and IRS elements
on detection performance. The proposed framework effectively bridges
theoretical optimality with implementation practicality, providing a scalable
solution for IRS-assisted IoT networks in emerging 6G systems.

Motivation: 为满足下一代多载波移动网络对服务质量的高要求，需设计适应复杂无线环境的信号方案。

Method: 结合啁啾序列（如Zadoff-Chu序列）与波形（如啁啾扩频和FMCW雷达），提出多功能啁啾多载波波形。

Result: 啁啾波形在高移动性通信和集成感知与通信（ISAC）中表现出优势。

Abstract: To meet the increasingly demanding quality-of-service requirements of the
next-generation multi-carrier mobile networks, it is essential to design
multi-functional signalling schemes facilitating efficient, flexible, and
reliable communication and sensing in complex wireless environments. As a
compelling candidate, we advocate chirp signalling, beneficially amalgamating
sequences (e.g., Zadoff-Chu sequences) with waveforms (e.g., chirp spread
spectrum and frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar), given their
resilience against doubly selective channels. Besides chirp sequences, a wide
range of chirp waveforms is considered, ranging from FMCW to affine
frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM), to create a promising chirp
multicarrier waveform. This study also highlights the advantages of such
waveforms in supporting reliable high-mobility communications, plus integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC). Finally, we outline several emerging
research directions for chirp signalling designs.

### [5] [Bayesian Radio Map Estimation: Fundamentals and Implementation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06037)
*Tien Ngoc Ha,Daniel Romero*

Motivation: 现有贝叶斯方法主要关注地图本身估计，而本文旨在更通用地处理地图后验分布，以支持更多功能（如容量、误码率等）的估计。

Method: 提出基于条件扩散模型的贝叶斯估计器，并与非贝叶斯方法进行理论和数值比较。

Result: 贝叶斯方法在不确定性处理和功能估计方面表现更优，尤其是在需要估计复杂功能时。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在特定场景下（如需要估计地图功能时）更具优势，条件扩散模型为通用贝叶斯估计提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Radio map estimation (RME) is the problem of inferring the value of a certain
metric (e.g. signal power) across an area of interest given a collection of
measurements. While most works tackle this problem from a purely non-Bayesian
perspective, some Bayesian estimators have been proposed. However, the latter
focus on estimating the map itself, the Bayesian standpoint is adopted mainly
to exploit prior information or to capture uncertainty. This paper pursues a
more general formulation, where the goal is to determine the posterior
distribution of the map given the measurements. Besides handling uncertainty
and allowing standard Bayesian estimates, solving this problem is seen to
enable minimum mean square error estimation of arbitrary map functionals (e.g.
capacity, bit error rate, or coverage area to name a few) while training only
for power estimation. A general Bayesian estimator is proposed based on
conditional diffusion models and both the Bayesian and non-Bayesian paradigms
are compared analytically and numerically to determine when the Bayesian
approach is preferable.

*Yiheng Wang,Shutao Zhang,Ye Xue,Tsung-Hui Chang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MM-LSCM是一种自监督多模态神经网络框架，用于下一代网络优化的局部统计信道建模，结合RSRP和LiDAR数据提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LSCM方法仅依赖RSRP数据，无法充分建模影响信号传播的环境结构，因此需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 提出双分支神经网络架构，整合RSRP和LiDAR点云数据，利用体积渲染多模态合成和环境自监督训练。

Result: 实验表明，MM-LSCM在信道重建精度和抗噪性上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MM-LSCM为实际无线网络优化提供了高效且无需标注数据的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents MM-LSCM, a self-supervised multi-modal neural radio
radiance field framework for localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) for
next-generation network optimization. Traditional LSCM methods rely solely on
RSRP data, limiting their ability to model environmental structures that affect
signal propagation. To address this, we propose a dual-branch neural
architecture that integrates RSRP data and LiDAR point cloud information,
enhancing spatial awareness and predictive accuracy. MM-LSCM leverages
volume-rendering-based multi-modal synthesis to align radio propagation with
environmental obstacles and employs a self-supervised training approach,
eliminating the need for costly labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate
that MM-LSCM significantly outperforms conventional methods in channel
reconstruction accuracy and robustness to noise, making it a promising solution
for real-world wireless network optimization.

Result: 单线程模拟5G OFDM符号检测仅需9.5秒至3分钟，并行化后可提速73-121倍。

Conclusion: 该框架为SDR硬件设计提供了高效的验证和性能分析工具。

Abstract: The fast-rising demand for wireless bandwidth requires rapid evolution of
high-performance baseband processing infrastructure. Programmable many-core
processors for software-defined radio (SDR) have emerged as high-performance
baseband processing engines, offering the flexibility required to capture
evolving wireless standards and technologies. This trend must be supported by a
design framework enabling functional validation and end-to-end performance
analysis of SDR hardware within realistic radio environment models. We propose
a static binary translation based simulator augmented with a fast, approximate
timing model of the hardware and coupled to wireless channel models to simulate
the most performance-critical physical layer functions implemented in software
on a many (1024) RISC-V cores cluster customized for SDR. Our framework
simulates the detection of a 5G OFDM-symbol on a server-class processor in
9.5s-3min, on a single thread, depending on the input MIMO size (three orders
of magnitude faster than RTL simulation). The simulation is easily parallelized
to 128 threads with 73-121x speedup compared to a single thread.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G及未来无线通信的复杂性增加，基站在严格延迟和功耗限制下需要处理高数据速率，同时需具备可编程性和可重构性以降低成本和时间。

Method: 设计了一个包含1024个精简RISC-V核心的集群，配备专用浮点扩展和4MB共享内存，支持软件定义的5G物理上行共享信道处理。

Result: 吞吐量比现有ASIP高10倍，能效达2-41 Gb/s/W，单集群处理PUSCH仅需1.7 ms，功耗低于6W。

Conclusion: 该设计在性能和能效上优于现有技术，为5G及未来基站提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Following the scale-up of new radio (NR) complexity in 5G and beyond, the
physical layer's computing load on base stations is increasing under a strictly
constrained latency and power budget; base stations must process > 20-Gb/s
uplink wireless data rate on the fly, in < 10 W. At the same time, the
programmability and reconfigurability of base station components are the key
requirements; it reduces the time and cost of new networks' deployment, it
lowers the acceptance threshold for industry players to enter the market, and
it ensures return on investments in a fast-paced evolution of standards. In
this article, we present the design of a many-core cluster for 5G and beyond
base station processing. Our design features 1024, streamlined RISC-V cores
with domain-specific FP extensions, and 4-MiB shared memory. It provides the
necessary computational capabilities for software-defined processing of the
lower physical layer of 5G physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), satisfying
high-end throughput requirements (66 Gb/s for a transition time interval (TTI),
9.4-302 Gb/s depending on the processing stage). The throughput metrics for the
implemented functions are ten times higher than in state-of-the-art (SoTA)
application-specific instruction processors (ASIPs). The energy efficiency on
key NR kernels (2-41 Gb/s/W), measured at 800 MHz, 25 {\deg}C, and 0.8 V, on a
placed and routed instance in 12-nm CMOS technology, is competitive with SoTA
architectures. The PUSCH processing runs end-to-end on a single cluster in 1.7
ms, at <6-W average power consumption, achieving 12 Gb/s/W.

### [9] [Efficient Deep Neural Receiver with Post-Training Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06275)
*SaiKrishna Saketh Yellapragada,Esa Ollila,Mario Costa*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在无线通信中应用深度学习，特别是卷积神经网络（CNN），以提升性能，但面临计算复杂性和资源需求高的挑战。研究聚焦于后训练量化（PTQ）技术，通过降低权重位宽减少模型复杂度，提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在无线通信中表现出优于传统算法的性能，但其高计算复杂性和资源需求限制了在资源受限的边缘系统中的部署。

Method: 采用对称均匀量化方法，包括逐张量和逐通道的后训练量化（PTQ），应用于神经接收器。

Result: 8位逐通道量化保持了与全精度模型相当的BLER性能，4位量化显示出潜力但需进一步优化。

Conclusion: 超低位宽PTQ在6G系统中部署高效神经接收器具有潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning has recently garnered significant interest in wireless
communications due to its superior performance compared to traditional
model-based algorithms. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
demonstrated notable improvements in block error rate (BLER) under various
channel models and mobility scenarios. However, the high computational
complexity and resource demands of deep CNNs pose challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained edge systems. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP) Release 20 highlights the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI)
integration in enabling advanced radio-access networks for 6G systems. The hard
real-time processing demands of 5G and 6G require efficient techniques such as
post-training quantization (PTQ), quantization-aware training (QAT), pruning,
and hybrid approaches to meet latency requirements. In this paper, we focus on
PTQ to reduce model complexity by lowering the bit-width of weights, thereby
enhancing computational efficiency. Our analysis employs symmetric uniform
quantization, applying both per-tensor and per-channel PTQ to a neural receiver
achieving performance comparable to full-precision models. Specifically, 8-bit
per-channel quantization maintains BLER performance with minimal degradation,
while 4-bit quantization shows great promise but requires further optimization
to achieve target BLER levels. These results highlight the potential of
ultra-low bitwidth PTQ for efficient neural receiver deployment in 6G systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出恶意可重构智能表面（MALRIS）的概念，揭示硬件级安全风险，并通过模拟攻击评估其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可重构智能表面（RIS）在无线通信中广泛应用，但其硬件安全问题被忽视，研究旨在揭示潜在威胁。

Method: 提出MALRIS概念，建模两种攻击（功率分割和单元分割），并在RIS辅助系统中进行模拟。

Result: 模拟显示，即使有限的硬件被攻陷，也会显著降低误码率、吞吐量和保密性等性能指标。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RIS的硬件安全威胁，呼吁未来无线网络中更安全的RIS部署。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enhance wireless communication by
dynamically shaping the propagation environment, but their integration
introduces hardware-level security risks. This paper presents the concept of
Malicious RIS (MALRIS), where compromised components behave adversarially, even
under passive operation. The focus of this work is on practical threats such as
manufacturing time tampering, malicious firmware, and partial element control.
Two representative attacks, power-splitting and element-splitting, are modeled
to assess their impact. Simulations in a RIS-assisted system reveal that even a
limited hardware compromise can significantly degrade performance metrics such
as bit error rate, throughput, and secrecy metrics. By exposing this overlooked
threat surface, this work aims to promote awareness and support secure,
trustworthy RIS deployment in future wireless networks.

### [11] [Full-Dimensional Beamforming for Multi-User MIMO-OFDM ISAC for Low-Altitude UAV with Zero Sensing Resource Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06428)
*Zhiwen Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MIMO-OFDM的无人机ISAC框架，无需专用感知资源，显著提升通信和感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ISAC系统因专用感知资源分配导致的通信频谱效率下降问题。

Method: 设计发射波束成形以满足通信和感知需求，引入低复杂度目标搜索波束成形算法和两阶段超分辨率感知算法。

Result: 仿真显示该框架不仅提高通信总速率，还在感知性能上优于传统ISAC系统。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来支持低空无人机的ISAC系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play an
important role for low-altitude economy with a wide range of applications like
precise agriculture, aerial delivery and surveillance. Integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) is a key technology to enable the large-scale deployment
and routine usage of UAVs by providing both communication and sensing services
efficiently. For UAV ISAC systems, as UAV often acts as both a communication
user equipment (UE) and a sensing target, traditional ISAC systems that usually
allocate dedicated TF resources for sensing are inefficient due to the severe
degradation of communication spectral efficiency. To address this issue, in
this paper, we propose a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC framework for UAVs that
eliminates the need for dedicated sensing TF resources, achieving zero TF
sensing overhead. By designing the transmit beamforming to meet the
requirements for both communication and sensing tasks, our proposed approach
enables the communication TF resources to be fully reused for sensing, thereby
enhancing both the communication sum rate and the sensing performance in terms
of resolution, unambiguous range, and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a
low-complexity target searching beamforming algorithm and a two-stage
super-resolution sensing algorithm, which ensure efficient implementation.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIMO-OFDM-ISAC framework not
only improves the communication sum rate but also outperforms traditional ISAC
systems in sensing performance, making it a promising solution for future ISAC
systems to support low-altitude UAVs.

*Peigen Ye,Jingpu Duan,Hongyang Du,Yulan Guo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户意图的语义通信系统，通过多模态大模型和注意力模块提升语义理解和传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信系统未能深入理解用户真实意图，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 结合多模态大模型生成用户意图先验，提出掩码引导注意力模块和信道状态感知模块。

Result: 在瑞利信道下（SNR 5 dB），PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS分别提升8%、6%和19%。

Conclusion: 该系统实现了深度意图理解，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Semantic communication focuses on transmitting task-relevant semantic
information, aiming for intent-oriented communication. While existing systems
improve efficiency by extracting key semantics, they still fail to deeply
understand and generalize users' real intentions. To overcome this, we propose
a user-intention-driven semantic communication system that interprets diverse
abstract intents. First, we integrate a multi-modal large model as semantic
knowledge base to generate user-intention prior. Next, a mask-guided attention
module is proposed to effectively highlight critical semantic regions. Further,
a channel state awareness module ensures adaptive, robust transmission across
varying channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system
achieves deep intent understanding and outperforms DeepJSCC, e.g., under a
Rayleigh channel at an SNR of 5 dB, it achieves improvements of 8%, 6%, and 19%
in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模分布式存储系统中，纠删码用于确保磁盘故障的可靠性。通过动态调整代码参数（代码转换）可以显著节省存储空间而不影响可靠性，因此需要设计高效的转换方法。

Method: 研究了将初始MDS码的多个码字合并为单个最终MDS码字的过程，提出了三种访问成本最优的构造方案，并优化了带宽成本。

Result: 三种构造方案分别在不同条件下实现了访问成本的最优化，第三种方案支持任意参数范围且字段大小接近理论下限。带宽优化方案减少了子分组化。

Conclusion: 论文提出的构造方案在访问成本和带宽成本上均实现了优化，为分布式存储系统的代码转换提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In large-scale distributed storage systems, erasure coding is employed to
ensure reliability against disk failures. Recent work by Kadekodi et al.
demonstrates that adapting code parameters to varying disk failure rates can
lead to significant storage savings without compromising reliability. Such
adaptations, known as \emph{code conversions}, motivate the design of
\emph{convertible codes}, which enable efficient transformations between codes
of different parameters.
  In this work, we study the setting in which $\lambda$ codewords of an initial
$[n^I = k^I + r^I,\, k^I]$ MDS code are merged into a single codeword of a
final $[n^F = \lambda k^I + r^F,\, k^F = \lambda k^I]$ MDS code. We begin by
presenting three constructions that achieve optimal \emph{access cost}, defined
as the total number of disks accessed during the conversion process. The first
two constructions apply when $\lambda \leq r^I$ and impose specific
divisibility conditions on $r^I$ and the field size $q$. These schemes minimize
both the per-symbol and the overall access cost. The third construction, which
builds on a prior scheme by Kong, achieves minimal access cost while supporting
arbitrary parameter regimes. All three constructions require field sizes that
are linear in the final code length, and notably, the third construction
achieves a field size that matches the lower bound implied by the MDS
conjecture in almost all cases. In addition, we propose a construction that
optimizes the \emph{bandwidth cost}, defined as the total number of symbols
transmitted during conversion. This scheme is a refinement of Maturana and
Rashmi's bandwidth-optimal construction based on the piggybacking framework,
and achieves reduced sub-packetization.

Result: 提出了高效的解析框架，适用于大规模天线阵列系统，并推导了覆盖概率和误码率的表达式。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了计算效率和易用性，适用于sub-THz频段的多天线系统性能分析。

Abstract: In this paper, we adopt the $\kappa$-$\mu$ model to characterize the
propagation in the sub-THz band. We develop a new exact representation of the
sum of squared independent and identically distributed $\kappa$-$\mu$ random
variables, which can be used to express the power of the received signal in
multi-antenna systems. Unlike existing ones, the proposed analytical framework
is remarkably tractable and computationally efficient, and thus can be
conveniently employed to analyze systems with massive antenna arrays. We derive
novel expressions for the probability density function and cumulative
distribution function, analyze their convergence and truncation error, and
discuss the computational complexity and the implementation aspects. Moreover,
we derive expressions for the coverage probability and bit error probability
for coherent binary modulations. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of an
uplink sub-THz system where a single-antenna user is served by a base station
employing maximum ratio combining.
