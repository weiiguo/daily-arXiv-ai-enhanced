Specifically, we implement a denoising autoencoder to estimate the distance between two equal intensity scatterers in the subwavelength regime. The machine learning models are trained on waveforms subject to a bandlimit constraint such that ranges much smaller than the inverse bandlimit are optimized in their precision. The autoencoder achieves effective dimensionality reduction, with the bottleneck layer exhibiting a strong and consistent correlation with the true scatterer separation. We confirm reproducibility across different training sessions and network initializations by analyzing the scaled encoder outputs and their robustness to noise. We investigate the behavior of the bottleneck layer for the following types of pulses: a traditional sinc pulse, a bandlimited triangle-type pulse, and a theoretically near-optimal pulse created from a spherical Bessel function basis. The Bessel signal performs best, followed by the triangle wave, with the sinc signal performing worst, highlighting the crucial role of signal design in the success of machine-learning-based range resolution."}

However, extending the DD framework to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in environments artificially enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), remains a challenging open problem. In this chapter, a novel metasurfaces-parametrized DD (MPDD) channel model that integrates an arbitrary number of RISs, while also incorporating SIM at both the transmitter and receiver is introduced. Next, the application of this model to some key waveforms optimized for DD environments -- namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) -- is discussed. Finally, the programmability of the proposed model is highlighted through an illustrative application, demonstrating its potential for enhancing waveform performance in SIM-assisted wireless systems."}

The TM-IRS is configured to preserve the integrity of transmitted signals toward multiple legitimate users while scrambling the signal in all other directions. Existing TM-IRS design methods typically target a single user direction and follow predefined rule-based procedures, making them unsuitable for multi-user scenarios. Here, we propose a generative AI-based approach to design good sets of TM-IRS parameters out of a set of all possible quantized ranges of parameters. The design objective is to maximize the sum rate across the authorized directions. We model the TM-IRS parameter selection as a deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state corresponds to a specific configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets are employed to learn a stochastic policy that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their associated sum rate reward. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the security of the TM-IRS-aided OFDM systems with multi-users. Also, despite the vast size of the TM-IRS configuration space, the GFlowNet is able to converge after training on fewer than 0.000001% of all possible configurations, demonstrating remarkable efficiency compared to exhaustive combinatorial search.

Vincent Poor"], "title": "An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals", "comment": "This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and communication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving. Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station (BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and sensing constraints."}

However, tracking optimal beams for multiple mobile users across multiple base stations (BSs) results in significant signaling overhead. Recent works have explored the capability of out-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless channels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user systems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense cell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing overhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to eliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in multi-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel OOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize multi-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB modalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially identified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and then tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence. Subsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network (BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for mobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to perform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the proposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS selection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the optimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS coordination efficiency compared to existing methods."}

To address the hardware and computational cost of gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from the digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming through reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on fully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via tunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving, their circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components, scales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of MiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC architectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a family of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while drastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize stem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that stem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that scales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance, scalable, gigantic MIMO."}

Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error.

In this paper, we establish both sum-SDoF lower and upper bounds through linear beamforming conditions and numerical methods.

The solutions to this optimization problem addresses RIS element allocation for leakage and interference cancellation. The proposed upper bound is obtained by solving a nuclear norm minimization problem, leveraging the fact that nuclear norm serves as a convex relaxation of the rank function. For symmetry antenna configurations, we derive a closed-form lower bound. Extensive numerical simulations show that our proposed lower and upper bounds coincide across many antenna configurations, and our proposed lower bound outperforms the existing benchmark."}

To address this, South Korea has decided to deploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system as a complementary PNT solution. Similar to GNSS, eLoran provides highly accurate timing information, which is essential for applications such as telecommunications, financial systems, and power distribution. However, the primary sources of error for GNSS and eLoran differ. For eLoran, the main source of error is signal propagation delay over land, known as the additional secondary factor (ASF). This delay, influenced by ground conductivity and weather conditions along the signal path, is challenging to predict and mitigate. In this paper, we measure the time difference (TD) between GPS and eLoran using a time interval counter and analyze the correlations between eLoran/GPS TD and eleven meteorological factors. Accurate estimation of eLoran/GPS TD could enable eLoran to achieve timing accuracy comparable to that of GPS. We propose two estimation models for eLoran/GPS TD and compare their performance with existing TD estimation methods. The proposed WLR-AGRNN model captures the linear relationships between meteorological factors and eLoran/GPS TD using weighted linear regression (WLR) and models nonlinear relationships between outputs from expert networks through an anisotropic general regression neural network (AGRNN). The model incorporates terrain elevation to appropriately weight meteorological data, as elevation influences signal propagation delay. Experimental results based on four months of data demonstrate that the WLR-AGRNN model outperforms other models, highlighting its effectiveness in improving eLoran/GPS TD estimation accuracy."}

Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods.

This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on performance of first-order 1D DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical expression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D DMA has been formulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array performance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF), Front-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and null depth (ND).

This paper derives the beamdepth for a generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry influences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field beamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis reveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is maximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a square URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely constrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a sum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended EBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities."}

Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that representational transitions in neural networks cause sharp changes in conditional entropy $H(x\\mid z)$, with intra-class variance (denoted $R_c^2$) and feature dimensionality as critical factors. Experiments on three representative deep vision models demonstrate that splitting at the representational-transition or decision-level layers increases mean squared error by more than four times compared to shallow splits, indicating significantly stronger resistance to MIA. Positive label smoothing further enhances robustness by compressing $R_c^2$ and improving generalization.

Vincent Poor"], "title": "An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals", "comment": "This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and communication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving. Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station (BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and sensing constraints."}

To address the hardware and computational cost of gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from the digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming through reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on fully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via tunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving, their circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components, scales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of MiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC architectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a family of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while drastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize stem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that stem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that scales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance, scalable, gigantic MIMO."}

Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining."}
