### [1] [Recursive decoding of binary rank Reed-Muller codes and Plotkin construction for matrix codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19095)
*Alain Couvreur,Rakhi Pratihar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了二进制情况下的秩度量Reed-Muller码的解码算法，提出了一种基于Plotkin "(u|u+v)"结构的递归解码方法，其渐近复杂度优于基于Dickson矩阵的现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Hamming度量二进制Reed-Muller码递归Plotkin结构的启发，研究秩度量Reed-Muller码的高效解码方法，以克服现有基于Dickson矩阵解码算法的复杂度问题。

Method: 采用递归的Plotkin "(u|u+v)"结构，针对特定子类的秩度量Reed-Muller码设计解码算法，并提出了通用的类Plotkin构造用于矩阵秩度量码。

Result: 所提出的递归解码算法在渐近复杂度上优于基于Dickson矩阵的现有算法，且具有完全不同的性质，能够自然地推广到秩度量版本的Plotkin构造。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅为特定子类的秩度量Reed-Muller码提供了高效解码方案，还建立了秩度量码的通用类Plotkin构造框架，为秩度量码的解码研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In 2021, Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri introduced a new class of rank
metric codes which can be regarded as rank metric counterparts of Reed-Muller
codes. Given a finite Galois extension $\mathbb{L} / \mathbb{K}$, these codes
are defined as some specific $\mathbb{L}$-subspaces of the twisted group
algebra $\mathbb{L} [\textrm{G}]$. We investigate the decoding of such codes in
the "binary" case, \emph{i.e.,} when $\textrm{G} = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^m$.
Our approach takes its inspiration from the decoding of Hamming metric binary
Reed-Muller codes using their recursive Plotkin "$(u ~|~ u+v)$" structure. If
our recursive algorithm restricts to a specific subclass of rank metric
Reed-Muller codes, its asymptotic complexity beats that of the recently
proposed decoding algorithm for arbitrary rank metric Reed-Muller codes based
on Dickson matrices. Also, this decoder is of completely different nature and
leads a natural rank metric counterpart of the Plotkin construction. To
illustrate this, we also propose a generic Plotkin-like construction for matrix
rank metric codes with an associate decoder, which can be applied to any pair
of codes equipped with an efficient decoder.

### [2] [Weighted Sum Rate Optimization for Movable Antenna Enabled Near-Field ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19759)
*Nemanja Stefan Perović,Keshav Singh,Chih-Peng Li,Mark F. Flanagan*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在近场集成感知与通信系统中使用可移动天线来最大化加权和速率，同时满足最小感知要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可移动天线有潜力进一步提升ISAC系统性能，但在近场球形波传播下实现这些增益面临挑战。

Method: 提出交替优化算法，联合优化感知接收合并器、通信预编码矩阵、感知发射波束成形器和用户可移动天线位置。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在近场ISAC系统中使用可移动天线相比固定天线系统具有显著性能优势，且靠近基站的用户分配更大权重时获得最高WSR。

Conclusion: 可移动天线能显著提升近场ISAC系统性能，感知性能对最小SINR阈值比通信性能更敏感。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as one of the
key technologies capable of simultaneously improving communication and sensing
services in future wireless networks. Moreover, the introduction of recently
developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the
performance gains of ISAC systems. Achieving these gains can pose a significant
challenge for MA-enabled ISAC systems operating in the near-field due to the
corresponding spherical wave propagation. Motivated by this, in this paper we
maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining
a minimal sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To
achieve this goal, we propose an algorithm that optimizes the sensing receive
combiner, the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer
and the positions of the users' MAs in an alternating manner. Simulation
results show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial
performance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems with only fixed
antennas. Additionally, we demonstrate that the highest WSR is obtained when
larger weights are allocated to the users placed closer to the BS, and that the
sensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the
communication performance.

### [3] [AI-Aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics for Rapid Optimization of Programmable Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18978)
*Tomer Shaked,Philipp del Hougne,George C. Alexandropoulos,Nir Shlezinger*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于AI辅助退火Langevin动态的快速优化方法，无需显式信道建模，通过深度神经网络估计梯度来优化可重构智能表面的信道参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要简化的信道模型来支持快速优化，但实际中这些模型往往是粗略近似，而更准确的描述需要复杂仿真或测量。

Method: 使用深度展开的退火Langevin动态算法，通过DNN估计梯度，结合零阶梯度和主动学习来训练，无需信道建模。

Result: 在受丰富散射效应影响的可重构智能表面场景中，该方法实现了快速可靠的信道参数调谐，具有有限延迟。

Conclusion: AI辅助的退火Langevin动态方法能够绕过显式信道建模需求，在复杂动态环境中实现快速信道优化。

Abstract: Emerging technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) make
it possible to optimize some parameters of wireless channels. Conventional
approaches require relating the channel and its programmable parameters via a
simple model that supports rapid optimization, e.g., re-tuning the parameters
each time the users move. However, in practice such models are often crude
approximations of the channel, and a more faithful description can be obtained
via complex simulators, or only by measurements. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach for rapid optimization of programmable channels based on
AI-aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD), which bypasses the need for explicit
channel modeling. By framing the ALD algorithm using the MAP estimate, we
design a deep unfolded ALD algorithm that leverages a Deep Neural Network (DNN)
to estimate score gradients for optimizing channel parameters. We introduce a
training method that overcomes the need for channel modeling using zero-order
gradients, combined with active learning to enhance generalization, enabling
optimization in complex and dynamically changing environments. We evaluate the
proposed method in RIS-aided scenarios subject to rich-scattering effects. Our
results demonstrate that our AI-aided ALD method enables rapid and reliable
channel parameter tuning with limited latency.

### [4] [Fundamental Limits of Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communications over Low-Earth Orbit THz Satellite Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19007)
*Haofan Dong,Houtianfu Wang,Hanlin Cai,Ozgur B. Akan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 开发了网络克拉美罗下界框架，分析太赫兹卫星间链路的性能极限，揭示硬件损伤、相位噪声和网络干扰对定位精度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹卫星间链路在低地球轨道星座中能提供前所未有的传感精度，但受到硬件损伤、指向误差和网络干扰的基本限制。

Method: 通过递归费舍尔信息分析，开发了网络克拉美罗下界框架，包含动态拓扑、硬件质量因子、相位噪声和协作效应。

Result: 发现了三个关键见解：硬件和相位噪声造成功率无关的性能上限和下限；干扰系数可实现机会性传感，增益达5.5dB；共享定时参考的测量相关性不会降低性能。

Conclusion: 亚毫米级测距需要硬件质量因子<0.01、相位噪声<10^{-2}的振荡器以及适当的三维几何配置的协同优化。

Abstract: Terahertz inter-satellite links enable unprecedented sensing precision for
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, yet face fundamental bounds from hardware
impairments, pointing errors, and network interference. We develop a Network
Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (N-CRLB) framework incorporating dynamic topology,
hardware quality factor $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$, phase noise $\sigma^2_\phi$, and
cooperative effects through recursive Fisher Information analysis. Our analysis
reveals three key insights: (i) hardware and phase noise create
power-independent performance ceilings ($\sigma_{\text{ceiling}} \propto
\sqrt{\Gamma_{\text{eff}}}$) and floors ($\sigma_{\text{floor}} \propto
\sqrt{\sigma^2_\phi}/f_c$), with power-only scaling saturating above
$\text{SNR}_{\text{crit}}=1/\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$; (ii) interference
coefficients $\alpha_{\ell m}$ enable opportunistic sensing with demonstrated
gains of 5.5~dB under specific conditions (65~dB processing gain, 50~dBi
antennas); (iii) measurement correlations from shared timing references, when
properly modeled, do not degrade performance and can provide common-mode
rejection benefits compared to mismodeled independent-noise baselines.
Sub-millimeter ranging requires co-optimized hardware
($\Gamma_{\text{eff}}<0.01$), oscillators ($\sigma^2_\phi<10^{-2}$), and
appropriate 3D geometry configurations.

### [5] [Macroscopic EEG Reveals Discriminative Low-Frequency Oscillations in Plan-to-Grasp Visuomotor Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19057)
*Anna Cetera,Sima Ghafoori,Ali Rabiee,Mohammad Hassan Farhadi,Yalda Shahriari,Reza Abiri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究开发了基于视觉的抓握平台，使用EEG研究抓握类型特异性神经活动，发现低频振荡在抓握类型解码中起关键作用，分类准确率优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然侵入式记录已成功解码局部神经活动，但非侵入式EEG捕获的宏观神经激活模式仍知之甚少，需要研究抓握类型特异性神经活动在大规模脑网络中的表现。

Method: 使用新型视觉抓握平台分离抓握规划与执行阶段，采用FBCSP技术提取频率特异性特征，SVM分类器进行二元和多元分类，并与传统MRCP方法比较。

Result: 低频振荡(0.5-8Hz)在规划阶段建立抓握相关信息并维持至执行阶段，精确抓握vs强力抓握分类准确率达75.3-77.8%，优于MRCP的61.1%；高频活动(12-40Hz)在抓握vs无抓握分类中达93.3%准确率。

Conclusion: 研究证明了低频振荡在非侵入式EEG解码抓握类型规划阶段的重要作用，特征重要性分析识别了规划阶段前顶叶网络和执行阶段运动网络的区分性特征。

Abstract: The vision-based grasping brain network integrates visual perception with
cognitive and motor processes for visuomotor tasks. While invasive recordings
have successfully decoded localized neural activity related to grasp type
planning and execution, macroscopic neural activation patterns captured by
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) remain far less understood. We
introduce a novel vision-based grasping platform to investigate
grasp-type-specific (precision, power, no-grasp) neural activity across
large-scale brain networks using EEG neuroimaging. The platform isolates
grasp-specific planning from its associated execution phases in naturalistic
visuomotor tasks, where the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP)
technique was designed to extract discriminative frequency-specific features
within each phase. Support vector machine (SVM) classification discriminated
binary (precision vs. power, grasp vs. no-grasp) and multiclass (precision vs.
power vs. no-grasp) scenarios for each phase, and were compared against
traditional Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) methods. Low-frequency
oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information established during
planning and maintained throughout execution, with consistent classification
performance across both phases (75.3-77.8\%) for precision vs. power
discrimination, compared to 61.1\% using MRCP. Higher-frequency activity (12-40
Hz) showed phase-dependent results with 93.3\% accuracy for grasp vs. no-grasp
classification but 61.2\% for precision vs. power discrimination. Feature
importance using SVM coefficients identified discriminative features within
frontoparietal networks during planning and motor networks during execution.
This work demonstrated the role of low-frequency oscillations in decoding grasp
type during planning using noninvasive EEG.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了可移动与可重构天线(MARA)的统一建模框架，结合几何可移动天线(GMA)和电磁可重构天线(ERA)的双重重构特性，研究了信道建模和频谱效率优化，并系统回顾了基于AI的高维非凸优化解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G系统向智能化和高可重构性发展，传统固定天线的局限性日益突出，GMA和ERA成为突破瓶颈的关键技术。但两者集成形成的"几何-电磁双重重构"范式给信号处理带来了高维混合优化的严峻挑战。

Method: 首次整合GMA的几何优化和ERA的电磁重构，提出MARA的统一建模框架，研究GMA、ERA和MARA的信道建模与频谱效率优化，并系统回顾基于AI的解决方案。

Result: 填补了现有文献在几何-电磁双重重构下AI驱动信号处理范式缺乏全面综述的空白，为具有高频谱效率和灵活性的6G无线系统设计与优化提供理论支持。

Conclusion: MARA框架通过整合GMA和ERA的双重重构特性，结合AI技术解决高维非凸优化问题，为6G无线通信系统的智能化和高可重构性发展提供了重要理论支撑。

Abstract: As 6G wireless communication systems evolve toward intelligence and high
reconfigurability, the limitations of traditional fixed antenna (TFA) has
become increasingly prominent, with geometrically movable antenna (GMA) and
electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA) emerging as key technologies
to break through this bottleneck. GMA activates spatial degrees of freedom
(DoF) by dynamically adjusting antenna positions, ERA regulates radiation
characteristics using tunable metamaterials, thereby introducing DoF in the
electromagnetic domain. However, the ``geometric-electromagnetic dual
reconfiguration" paradigm formed by their integration poses severe challenges
of high-dimensional hybrid optimization to signal processing. To address this
issue, we integrate the geometric optimization of GMA and the electromagnetic
reconfiguration of ERA for the first time, propose a unified modeling framework
for movable and reconfigurable antenna (MARA), investigate the channel modeling
and spectral efficiency (SE) optimization for GMA, ERA, and MARA. Besides, we
systematically review artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, focusing on
analyzing the advantages of AI over traditional algorithms in high-dimensional
non-convex optimization computations. This paper fills the gap in existing
literature regarding the lack of a comprehensive review on the AI-driven signal
processing paradigm under geometric-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration and
provides theoretical support for the design and optimization of 6G wireless
systems with high SE and flexibility.

### [7] [Generalized Modified Blake-Zisserman Robust Spline Adaptive Filter for Generalized Gaussian Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19256)
*Haiquan Zhao,Bei Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了基于广义修正Blake-Zisserman的稳健样条自适应滤波(SAF-GMBZ)算法，在广义高斯噪声环境下表现出优越性能，并进一步开发了FcGMBZ算法用于主动噪声控制应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAF算法在广义高斯噪声环境下性能下降，在脉冲噪声下存在显著稳态失配，且未能有效处理异常值的影响。

Method: 提出SAF-GMBZ算法，计算步长的均值收敛范围和稳态均方误差，并基于此开发FcGMBZ算法用于主动噪声控制。

Result: 仿真结果验证了理论稳态MSE的准确性，SAF-GMBZ在广义高斯噪声环境下表现出优越性，FcGMBZ在脉冲噪声环境下的主动噪声控制中有效。

Conclusion: SAF-GMBZ算法解决了传统SAF算法在噪声环境下的性能问题，FcGMBZ算法在主动噪声控制应用中具有良好的收敛精度和噪声消除能力。

Abstract: The spline adaptive filtering (SAF) algorithm-based information-theoretic
learning has exhibited strong convergence performance in nonlinear system
identification (NSI), establishing SAF as a promising framework for adaptive
filtering. However, existing SAF-based methods suffer from performance
degradation under generalized Gaussian noise (GGN) environment and exhibit
significant steady-state misalignment under impulse noise. Moreover, prior
research on SAF algorithms has not effectively addressed the adverse effects
caused by outliers. To overcome these challenges, the generalized modified
Blake-Zisserman robust spline adaptive filtering (SAF-GMBZ) algorithm is
proposed. Compared to conventional SAF algorithms, SAF-GMBZ exhibits superior
learning performance in GGN. Furthermore, the mean convergence ranges of the
step-sizes and the steady-state mean-square error (MSE) are calculated by
introducing the commonly utilized assumptions. To arrive at good convergence
accuracy and noise cancellation capability in active noise control (ANC)
application, the filter-c GMBZ (FcGMBZ) algorithm is further developed based on
SAF-GMBZ. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the theoretical
steady-state MSE, and the superiority of the SAF-GMBZ algorithm under GGN
environment in NSI, along with the effectiveness of the FcGMBZ algorithm in ANC
application under impulsive noise environment.

### [8] [A Study on Delay Assessment for Heterogenous Traffic in VANET](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19267)
*Shama Siddiqu,Indrakshi Dey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 比较802.11p和FROG-MAC两种VANET MAC协议的性能，FROG-MAC通过分片传输机制为紧急数据提供更早的信道访问机会，减少了延迟并提高了吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANET中多优先级异构节点产生的数据需要差异化服务，802.11p协议在非关键消息开始传输时，关键数据节点必须等待，存在延迟问题。

Method: 通过模拟评估两种协议的延迟和吞吐量性能，FROG-MAC将普通数据包分片传输并在分片间设置短暂间隔，让紧急数据包能在这些间隔中访问信道。

Result: FROG-MAC在延迟和吞吐量两个性能参数上都优于802.11p，因为其为紧急流量提供了更早的信道访问机会。

Conclusion: FROG-MAC协议通过分片传输机制有效解决了VANET中紧急数据访问信道的延迟问题，性能优于标准802.11p协议。

Abstract: Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) comprise of multi-priority hetero-genous
nodes, both stationary and/or mobile. The data generated by these nodes may
include messages relating to information, safety, entertainment, traffic
management and emergency alerts. The data in the network needs dif-ferentiated
service based on the priority/urgency. Media Access Control (MAC) protocols
hold a significant value for managing the data priority. This paper studies a
comparison of 802.11p which is a standard PHY and MAC protocol for VANET with a
fragmentation-based protocol, FROG-MAC. The major design principle of 802.11-p
is to allow direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
communication without associa-tion, using Enhanced Distributed Channel Access
(EDCA) to prioritize safety-critical messages. However, if non-critical
messages already start to transmit, the nodes with critical data have to wait.
FROG-MAC reduces this delay by transmitting normal packets in fragments with
short pauses between them, al-lowing urgent packets to access the channel
during these intervals. Simula-tions have been performed to assess the delay
and throughput for high and low priority data. We report that FROG-MAC improves
both the performance parameters due to offering an early channel access to the
emergency traffic.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高中教师因工作压力大和多任务要求，经常面临睡眠质量和认知功能问题，这对教学能力产生负面影响。

Method: 部署嵌入脉搏率和血氧传感器的智能手表监测睡眠质量，并使用认知评估问卷进行自我评估，研究覆盖208名巴基斯坦高中教师。

Result: 研究发现大多数教师睡眠质量差且认知功能受损，睡眠质量与认知功能之间存在明显关联。

Conclusion: 教师的工作负荷和其他因素需要改善，以确保他们的福祉，这将反过来对教学质量产生积极影响。

Abstract: Sleep quality is an important indicator of the efficient cognitive function
for high school teachers. Due to the high work stress and multi-tasking
expectations, the teachers often face issues with their sleep quality and
cognitive function, which has a clearly negative influence on their teaching
abilities. In this work, we propose a unique but simple method of deploying
Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the sleep quality of high school
teachers at Pakistan. Smart watches embedded with pulse rate and SpO2 sensors
were used to collect data and categorize the sleep quality as "poor", "fair" or
"good". Moreover, we used a psychological tool, Cognitive Assessment
Questionnaire (CAQ) for the self-assessment of teachers' cognitive function.
The study was conducted over 208 high school teachers from across Pakistan. It
has been found that most of the teachers had a poor sleep quality and cognitive
function; The link between these two variables indicate that the workload and
other factors must be improved for the teachers to ensure their well-being,
which will in turn have a positive impact on their teaching quality.

Conclusion: 证明了低功耗神经形态芯片在增材制造边缘异常检测中的可行性，为相关应用建立了技术框架。

Abstract: This study is the first application of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
anomaly detection in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing
process. The neural networks were used to identify print processing anomalies
generated by dropping of laser energy during the printing of individual layers
in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy lattice structures. Associated changes in the laser
generated melt pool were observed using an in-process photodiode monitoring
technique. photodiode sensors capturing plasma and infrared radiations
reflected from the print bed of the metal 3D printer were utilized to detect
sudden changes caused by anomalies during the printing process. The algorithm
is first implemented on non-neuromorphic hardware including a central
processing unit (CPU), on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and then on
neuromorphic Intel's Loihi chip. Improved detection of anomalies is achieved by
adjusting the spike latency of the neural network, which reduces masking of
information by noise within the monitored temporal signal. The work
demonstrates the possibility of using low-power neuromorphic chips within an
edge framework for anomaly detection in additive manufacturing and creates a
framework for the process.

Conclusion: 所提出的动态码率调整框架能够有效解决多边缘协同推理系统中的通信效率问题，在保持推理性能的同时优化带宽利用。

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with the internet of things
(IoT) enables task-oriented communication for multi-edge cooperative inference
system, where edge devices transmit extracted features of local sensory data to
an edge server to perform AI-driven tasks. However, the privacy concerns and
limited communication bandwidth pose fundamental challenges, since simultaneous
transmission of extracted features with a single fixed compression ratio from
all devices leads to severe inefficiency in communication resource utilization.
To address this challenge, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts the
code rate in feature extraction based on its importance to the downstream
inference task by adopting a rate-adaptive quantization (RAQ) scheme.
Furthermore, to select the code rate for each edge device under limited
bandwidth constraint, a dynamic programming (DP) approach is leveraged to
allocate the code rate across discrete code rate options. Experiments on
multi-view datasets demonstrate that the proposed frameworks significantly
outperform the frameworks using fixed-rate quantization, achieving a favorable
balance between communication efficiency and inference performance under
limited bandwidth conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates narrow-beam channel characterization and performance
evaluation for 5G for railway (5G-R) systems based on ray-tracing (RT)
simulation. Three representative high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios including
viaduct, cutting, and station are established, and RT-based dynamic narrow-beam
channel simulations are conducted using a designed beam tracking scheme that
ensures continuous alignment with the moving train. The channel characteristics
are analyzed in terms of both large-scale and small-scale fading, as well as
non-stationarity, providing statistical insights into path loss, shadow fading,
fading severity, time-frequency-space dispersion, and stationarity interval.
The influence of beamwidth on these channel properties is also examined.
Furthermore, the performance of 5G-R systems operating in such narrow-beam
channels is evaluated using the Vienna 5G simulator, with a focus on block
error rate, throughput, and spectral efficiency. A hardware-in-the-loop
simulation platform is developed to further assess synchronization signal
reference signal received power, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, and
reference signal received quality. The results provide valuable guidance for
the design and optimization of 5G-R systems in HSR environments.

Abstract: Channel measurements are the prerequisite for applying emerging transmission
technologies and designing communication systems. In sixth-generation (6G)
system, conventional time or frequency domain channel sounding methods cannot
directly obtain Doppler information induced by high-mobility scenarios. The
channel spreading function (CSF) simultaneously captures delay and Doppler
information, while naturally characterizing the propagation environment in the
delay-Doppler (DD) domain. However, DD domain channel sounding methods remain
underexplored. This paper presents a novel DD domain channel sounding method
for 6G high-mobility scenarios. First, we introduce the waveform design for the
sounding signal and analyze its sounding capability. Next, the methodology of
DD domain channel sounding, including synchronization and CSF estimation, is
thoroughly detailed. Additionally, an algorithm for enhancing measurement
precision is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously
evaluated. Subsequently, a DD domain channel sounding system competent for 6G
high-mobility scenarios is established. Finally, DD domain channel measurements
are conducted for a vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario in urban environments.
Measurement results, including CSF, power delay profile, Doppler power spectral

Abstract: This paper investigates security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) Time
Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization
in low-altitude urban environments. We first optimize node selection strategies
under Air to Ground (A2G) channel conditions, proving that optimal selection
depends on UAV altitude and deployment density. We propose lightweight User
Equipment (UE)-assisted that reduce overhead while enhancing accuracy. We then
expose critical security vulnerabilities by introducing merged-peak spoofing
attacks where rogue UAVs transmit multiple lower-power pulses that merge with
legitimate signals, bypassing existing detection methods. Through theoretical
modeling and sensitivity analysis, we quantify how synchronization quality and
geometric factors determine spoofing success probability, revealing fundamental
weaknesses in current 3GPP positioning frameworks. To address these
vulnerabilities, we design a network-centric anomaly detection framework at the
Localization Management Function (LMF) using existing 3GPP-specified
parameters, coupled with a recursive gradient descent-based robust localization
algorithm that filters anomaly data while estimating UAV position. Our unified
framework simultaneously provides robust victim localization and spoofer
localization-capabilities not integrated in existing literature. Extensive
simulations validate the effectiveness of both optimization and security
mechanisms for 3GPP-compliant UAV positioning.

### [15] [On the Robustness of AFDM and OTFS Against Passive Eavesdroppers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19525)
*Vincent Savaux,Hyeon Seok Rou,Zeping Sui,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,Zilong Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文比较了AFDM和OTFS波形对被动窃听者的鲁棒性，分析表明AFDM具有更好的抗窃听能力，其暴力破解复杂度为O(N²)，而OTFS为O(√N)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AFDM和OTFS波形在窃听者进行暴力解调时的安全性，评估两种波形在物理层安全方面的性能差异。

Method: 通过理论分析计算暴力解调的复杂度，并进行比特误码率仿真验证分析结果。

Result: 分析结果显示AFDM的暴力破解复杂度为O(N²)，OTFS为O(√N)，BER仿真证实AFDM信号在窃听端几乎无法解码，而OTFS允许部分信号恢复。

Conclusion: AFDM在抗被动窃听方面优于OTFS，具有更高的物理层安全性。

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of affine frequency division multiplexing
(AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveforms against passive
eavesdroppers performing brute-force demodulation to intercepted signals, under
the assumption that eavesdroppers have no knowledge of chirp parameters (in
AFDM) or the delay-Doppler grid configuration (in OTFS), such that they must
search exhaustively over possible demodulation matrices. Analytical results
show that the brute-force complexity scales as $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ for OTFS
and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ for AFDM, where $N$ is the number of subcarriers,
indicating that AFDM has superior resilience over OTFS. Bit error rate (BER)
simulations confirm the analysis by showing that, with AFDM, the signal remains
nearly undecodable at the eavesdropper, while OTFS allows partial signal
recovery under equivalent conditions.

*Sahar Maleki,Reza Lashgari,Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli,Mohammad Komareji*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了使用MLP神经网络模型来调整局部场电位对比度响应函数的新方法，相比传统方法能更好地拟合神经群体活动的对比敏感度调谐曲线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 局部场电位的响应调谐通常比尖峰调谐更弱和更宽，因此需要优化的调谐方法来准确评估LFP响应并与邻近的尖峰活动进行比较。

Method: 首先分析灵长类初级视觉皮层记录的亮度对比度诱发的LFP响应，使用单调性指数区分超饱和、线性和饱和CRF，然后通过MLP神经网络、RBF神经网络、模糊模型、神经模糊模型和LOLIMOT算法等静态识别方法识别超饱和记录数据。

Result: 与传统的和改进的双曲Naka-Rushton函数相比，MLP神经网络在调整局部场电位对亮度对比度刺激的响应方面表现出更优越的性能，成功调整了所有三种类型的显著更多神经记录。

Conclusion: MLP神经网络模型可以作为测量神经群体对比敏感度调谐曲线的新方法，比其他当前使用的模型提供更好的拟合效果。

Abstract: Local field potentials (LFPs) have been demonstrated to be an important
measurement to study the activity of a local population of neurons. The
response tunings of LFPs have been mostly reported as weaker and broader than
spike tunings. Therefore, selecting optimized tuning methods is essential for
appropriately evaluating the LFP responses and comparing them with neighboring
spiking activity. In this paper, new models for tuning of the contrast response
functions (CRFs) are proposed. To this end, luminance contrast-evoked LFP
responses recorded in primate primary visual cortex (V1) are first analyzed.
Then, supersaturating CRFs are distinguished from linear and saturating CRFs by
using monotonicity index (MI). The supersaturated recording data are then
identified through static identification methods including multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network,
fuzzy model, neuro-fuzzy model, and the local linear model tree (LOLIMOT)
algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the MLP neural network, compared to
traditional and modified hyperbolic Naka-Rushton functions, exhibits superior
performance in tuning the local field potential responses to luminance contrast
stimuli, resulting in successful tuning of a significantly higher number of
neural recordings of all three types. These results suggest that the MLP neural
network model can be used as a novel approach to measure a better fitted
contrast sensitivity tuning curve of a population of neurons than other
currently used models.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于微多普勒能量的77GHz FMCW雷达多目标生命体征监测框架，通过能量变化而非相位来检测心肺活动，具有抗环境噪声和身体运动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于相位的方法易受环境噪声、随机身体运动和严格校准要求的影响，需要更鲁棒的生命体征监测方法。

Method: 集成空间-时间自适应处理(STAP)进行目标检测跟踪，MUSIC算法进行高分辨率角度估计，以及创新的自适应谱滤波技术提取生命体征。建立了微多普勒能量变化与生理活动关系的数学框架。

Result: 在5米范围内准确检测和分离最多四个目标的生命体征，呼吸率和心率平均绝对误差分别为1.2次/分钟和2.3次/分钟，性能优于传统相位方法。

Conclusion: 微多普勒能量提取方法对相位噪声和运动伪影具有固有鲁棒性，在多目标场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel micro-Doppler energy-based framework for robust
multi-target vital signs monitoring using 77-GHz Frequency-Modulated
Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Unlike conventional phase-based methods that are
susceptible to environmental noise, random body movements, and stringent
calibration requirements, our approach exploits the energy variations in radar
returns induced by cardiopulmonary activities. The proposed system integrates a
comprehensive processing pipeline including space-time adaptive processing
(STAP) for target detection and tracking, MUSIC algorithm for high-resolution
angle estimation, and an innovative adaptive spectral filtering technique for
vital signs extraction. We establish a rigorous mathematical framework that
formalizes the relationship between micro-Doppler energy variations and
physiological activities, enabling robust separation of closely spaced targets.
The key innovation lies in the micro-Doppler energy extraction methodology that
provides inherent robustness to phase noise and motion artifacts. Experimental
results using millimeter-wave radar datasets demonstrate that the system can
accurately detect and separate vital signs of up to four targets within
\SI{5}{\meter} range, achieving mean absolute errors of \SI{1.2}beats per
minute and \SI{2.3} beats per minute for respiration and heart rates,
respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared
to traditional phase-based methods, particularly in challenging multi-target
scenarios with environmental noise and subject movement.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究评估了ECG和ICG特征在生物识别中的表现，发现QRS相关的ECG特征在情绪变化下具有稳定的识别能力，而ICG的BCX特征提供补充性但稳定性较低的信息。通过特征选择可将特征集从29个减少到14个，同时保持99%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ECG和ICG特征在生物识别中的区分能力和对情绪变化的鲁棒性，探索哪些特征在个体识别中最为关键和稳定。

Method: 使用随机森林模型结合多种可解释性方法（Gini重要性、排列重要性、SHAP值）评估29个ECG和ICG特征，并进行相关性分析、统计分析和特征选择（递归特征消除和遗传算法）。

Result: ECG特征特别是QRS相关描述符在所有评估方法中排名最高，ICG BCX特征提供补充信息但稳定性较低。特征选择可将特征集减少到14个，准确率仅下降1%。QRS相关特征在情绪变化下保持稳定识别能力。

Conclusion: 可靠的个体识别主要依赖于QRS相关的ECG特征，这些特征对情绪变化具有鲁棒性；ICG BCX特征主要通过幅度提供支持性但稳定性较低的区分线索。QRS中心描述符可能在未来基于心电图的身份识别模型中发挥核心作用。

Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance
cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their
discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29
features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological)
are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple
interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and
ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini
importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features,
particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In
parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower
cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial
multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across
highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions.
Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences
between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature
selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges
on a subset (14 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set
(99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. These complementary
analyses indicate that the individuality required for reliable identification
is primarily encoded in QRS-related ECG features across all four domains.
Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude,
providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed
resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable
inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations
in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry, may indicate
their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.
