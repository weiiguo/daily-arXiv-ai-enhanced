Among them, perturbation based approaches underpin many\nstrong likelihood estimation models, yet they often face slow convergence and\nlimited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we derive a tighter\nlikelihood bound for noise driven models to improve both the accuracy and\nefficiency of maximum likelihood learning. Our key insight extends the\nclassical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise\nperturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured\nnoise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise\ndistributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization\neffects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with\nstandard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian\nchannel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model,\nshowing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood\n(NLL). In experiments, our models achieve competitive NLL on CIFAR-10 and SOTA\nresults on ImageNet across multiple resolutions, all without data augmentation,\nand the framework extends naturally to discrete data."}

Existing methods either allow unconstrained nucleotide additions to\nindividual strands, such as enzymatic synthesis, or enforce identical additions\nacross many strands, such as photolithographic synthesis. We introduce and\nanalyze a hybrid synthesis framework that generalizes both approaches: in each\ncycle, a nucleotide is selected from a restricted subset and incorporated in\nparallel. This model gives rise to a new notion of a complex synthesis\nsequence. Building on this framework, we extend the information rate definition\nof Lenz et al. and analyze an analog of the deletion ball, defined and studied\nin this setting, deriving tight expressions for the maximal information rate\nand its asymptotic behavior. These results bridge the theoretical gap between\nconstrained models and the idealized setting in which every nucleotide is\nalways available. For the case of known strands, we design a dynamic\nprogramming algorithm that computes an optimal complex synthesis sequence,\nhighlighting structural similarities to the shortest common supersequence\nproblem. We also define a distinct two-dimensional array model with synthesis\nconstraints over the rows, which extends previous synthesis models in the\nliterature and captures new structural limitations in large-scale strand\narrays. Additionally, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm for this\nproblem as well.

To address\nthis issue, we propose a generative communication framework based on diffusion\nmodels, which integrates joint source channel coding (JSCC) with\nsemantic-guided reconstruction leveraging a pre-trained generative model.\nUnlike conventional architectures that aim to recover exact pixel values of the\noriginal image, the proposed method focuses on preserving and reconstructing\nsemantically meaningful visual content under severely constrained rates,\nensuring perceptual plausibility and faithfulness to the scene intent.\nSpecifically, the transmitter encodes the source image via JSCC and jointly\ntransmits it with a textual prompt over the wireless channel. At the receiver,\nthe corrupted low-rate representation is fused with the prompt and\nreconstructed through a Stable Diffusion model with ControlNet, enabling\nhigh-quality visual recovery. Leveraging both generative priors and semantic\nguidance, the proposed framework produces perceptually convincing images even\nunder extreme bandwidth limitations.

Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold\ndetectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often\nlarge amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort\ncomplex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study\nexplores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale\napplications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be\nanalyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying\ndynamics.\n  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two\nsingle-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection.

This paper\nintroduces a simple, code-agnostic framework that reduces the worst-case\ncomplexity by a factor of $n$, down to $q^{k}$ operations, a highly desirable\nreduction in practice. The result holds for both linear and nonlinear block\ncodes over general memoryless channels and under both hard-decision and\nsoft-decision decoding. It naturally extends to intersymbol-interference (ISI)\nchannels and ML list decoding with only a negligible increase in complexity.\nOur core insight is that, upon receipt of each sequence at the receiver, the\nconditional probability of that sequence for each codeword in the codebook\n(i.e., the \\emph{likelihood}) can be expressed as the inner product of two\ncarefully constructed vectors -- the first depending on the received sequence,\nand the second on that codeword itself. As a result, evaluating the likelihoods\nfor all codewords in the codebook reduces to a single vector-matrix\nmultiplication, and ML decoding (MLD) becomes the simple task of picking the\nmaximum entry in the resulting vector.
