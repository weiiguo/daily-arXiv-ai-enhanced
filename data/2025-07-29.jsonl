Besides, the realization of a cell-free network is considered\nto be a gradual long-term evolutionary process in which cell-free APs will be\nincrementally introduced into existing cellular networks, and form a hybrid\ncommunication network with the existing cellular base stations (BSs). Such a\ncollaboration will bridge the gap between the established cellular network and\nthe innovative cellfree network.

While wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology is commonly used for UAV RC\nlinks, ISM-based long-term evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G)\ntechnologies have also been recently considered for the same purpose. A major\nproblem for UAV RC links in the ISM bands is that other types of interference\nsources, such as legacy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmissions, may degrade the link\nquality. Such interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV in the air\nthan the RC unit on the ground due to the UAV being in line-of-sight (LoS) with\na larger number of interference sources. To obtain empirical evidence of the\nasymmetric interference conditions in downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), we first\nconducted a measurement campaign using a helikite platform in urban and rural\nareas at NC State University. The results from this measurement campaign show\nthat the aggregate interference can be up to 16.66 dB at higher altitudes up to\n170 m, compared with the interference observed at a ground receiver. As a\nresult of this asymmetric UL interference, lost hybrid automatic repeat request\n(HARQ) indicators (ACK/NACK) in the UL may degrade the DL throughput. To\ninvestigate this, we study various HARQ mechanisms, including HARQ Type-I with\nno combining, HARQ Type-I with chase combining, HARQ Type-III with incremental\nredundancy, and burst transmission with chase combining.

This\npaper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated\nextreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation\nframework.

To\naddress this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal\nModel Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality\nrooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to\ndistinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the\nneed for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA. Our key innovation\nlies in shuffle-based orthogonalization, where randomly permuting the positions\nof JSCC feature vectors transforms inter-user interference into Gaussian-like\nnoise. By assigning each user a unique shuffling pattern, the interference is\ntreated as channel noise, enabling effective mitigation using diffusion models\n(DMs). This approach not only simplifies system design by requiring a single\nuniversal JSCC model but also enhances privacy, as shuffling patterns act as\nimplicit private keys. Additionally, we extend the framework to scenarios\ninvolving semantically correlated data.

Along with interfernce analysis, we propose a low-complexity\nsuccessive interference cancellation method that adaptively cancels either the\nmonostatic reflection or the bistatic line-of-sight signal based on a\nmonostatic radar image signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The\nproposed framework is evaluated with both simulations and proof-of-concept\nmeasurements using an ISAC testbed with a radar echo generator for object\nemulation. The results have shown that the proposed method reduces BER and\nimproves EVM as well as radar image SINR across a wide range of SINR\nconditions. These results demonstrate that accurate component-wise cancellation\ncan be achieved with low computational overhead, making the method suitable for\npractical applications."}

In WBP, the Tanner graph of the code is unrolled with respect to\nthe iterations of the belief propagation decoder. Then, weights are assigned to\nthe edges of the resulting recurrent network and optimized offline using a\ntraining dataset. The main contribution of this paper is an adaptive WBP where\nthe weights of the decoder are determined for each received word. Two variants\nof this decoder are investigated. In the parallel WBP decoders, the weights\ntake values in a discrete set. A number of WBP decoders are run in parallel to\nsearch for the best sequence of weights in real time. In the two-stage decoder,\na small neural network is used to dynamically determine the weights of the WBP\ndecoder for each received word. The proposed adaptive decoders demonstrate\nsignificant improvements over the static counterparts in two applications. In\nthe first application, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, polar and quasi-cyclic\nlow-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes are used over an additive white\nGaussian noise channel. The results indicate that the adaptive WBP achieves bit\nerror rates (BERs) up to an order of magnitude less than the BERs of the static\nWBP at about the same decoding complexity, depending on the code, its rate, and\nthe signal-to-noise ratio. The second application is a concatenated code\ndesigned for a long-haul nonlinear optical fiber channel where the inner code\nis a QC-LDPC code and the outer code is a spatially coupled LDPC code. In this\ncase, the inner code is decoded using an adaptive WBP, while the outer code is\ndecoded using the sliding window decoder and static belief propagation. The\nresults show that the adaptive WBP provides a coding gain of 0.8 dB compared to\nthe neural normalized min-sum decoder, with about the same computational\ncomplexity and decoding latency."}

Compared to traditional systems, inter-user\ninterference in SemCom severely degrades key semantic information, often\ncausing worse performance than Gaussian noise under the same power level. To\naddress this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal\nModel Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality\nrooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to\ndistinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the\nneed for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA. Our key innovation\nlies in shuffle-based orthogonalization, where randomly permuting the positions\nof JSCC feature vectors transforms inter-user interference into Gaussian-like\nnoise. By assigning each user a unique shuffling pattern, the interference is\ntreated as channel noise, enabling effective mitigation using diffusion models\n(DMs). This approach not only simplifies system design by requiring a single\nuniversal JSCC model but also enhances privacy, as shuffling patterns act as\nimplicit private keys. Additionally, we extend the framework to scenarios\ninvolving semantically correlated data. By grouping users based on semantic\nsimilarity, a cooperative beamforming strategy is introduced to exploit\nredundancy in correlated data, further improving system performance. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art\nmulti-user SemCom frameworks, achieving superior semantic fidelity, robustness\nto interference, and scalability-all without requiring additional training\noverhead."}

Such updates are typically performed through handoff\n(HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the\nallocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for\nmobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with\ncontinuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve\nas the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that\nintegrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the\nassociated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the\nfirst one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on\nthe user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA)\nobservations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF).\nSimulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is\nmore scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy\nautomatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the\noverhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a\nresponse time less than 0.4 ms."}
