In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this paradigm is\nwell-suited for collaborative inference between resource-constrained end\ndevices and more capable edge servers or base stations (BSs). However, existing\ndistributed speculative decoding requires transmitting the full vocabulary\nprobability distribution from the draft model on the device to the target model\nat the BS, which leads to prohibitive uplink communication overhead. To address\nthis issue, we propose a ``Top-K Sparse Logits Transmission (TK-SLT)`` scheme,\nwhere the draft model transmits only the top-K token raw probabilities and the\ncorresponding token indices instead of the entire distribution. This approach\nsignificantly reduces bandwidth consumption while maintaining inference\nperformance. We further derive an analytical expression for the optimal draft\nlength that maximizes inference throughput, and provide a theoretical analysis\nof the achievable speedup ratio under TK-SLT. Experimental results validate\nboth the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method."}

Conventional automotive radars are usually based on\nfar-field models and estimate the target's range, radial velocity, and\ndirection-of-arrival (DOA) but are not able to estimate the tangential\ncomponent of the target 2-D velocity, which is a critical parameter for\nreliable perception of dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce the near-field radar model, which considers various migration\nelements in range, radial velocity, and Doppler along time and space.\nConventionally, these migration effects result in smearing of the likelihood\nfunction for estimating the target parameters. However, if the model is\ncorrectly specified, these migration effects are informative for tangential\nvelocity estimation. We conduct an identifiability analysis for tangential\nvelocity estimation using the Cram\\'er-Rao bound and ambiguity function. The\ninsights from this study motivate the use of a separated array configuration\nand the development of a computationally efficient maximum likelihood based\nalgorithm designed to utilize target migrations for tangential velocity\nestimation, while maintaining practical computational complexity. In addition\nto tangential velocity estimation, the proposed algorithm mitigates likelihood\nsmearing in range, radial velocity, and Doppler. Simulations validate the\ntheoretical feasibility study, and evaluate the algorithms' performance in both\nsingle- and multi-target scenarios. The proposed approach improves the accuracy\nand reliability of automotive radars, enhancing situational awareness for\nadvanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles."}
