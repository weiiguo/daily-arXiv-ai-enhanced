From a coding viewpoint, the DL channel state acquired at\nthe users via DL training can be seen as an information source that must be\nconveyed to the base station via the UL communication channels. The\ntransmission of a source through a channel can be accomplished either by\nseparate or joint source-channel coding (SSCC or JSCC). In this work, using\nclassical remote distortion-rate (DR) theory, we first provide a theoretical\nlower bound on the channel estimation mean-square-error (MSE) of both JSCC and\nSSCC-based feedback schemes, which however requires encoding of large blocks of\nsuccessive channel states and thus cannot be used in practicesince it would\nincur in an extremely large feedback delay. We then focus on the relevant case\nof minimal (one slot) feedback delay and propose a practical JSCC-based\nfeedback scheme that fully exploits the channel second-order statistics to\noptimize the dimension projection in the eigenspace.

In this paper, we investigate the channel\nestimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel\nestimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated\nis decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent\nchannel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based\nchannels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation\nscheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity\ninformation, a robust rank selection rule is developed. For beamforming, we\npropose an offline algorithm to optimize the STE phase shifts for wide beam\ncoverage, and an online algorithm to optimize the BS precoder and the DTE phase\nshifts using the estimated HE-IRS channel.

The architecture incorporates a single or multiple\nradio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase\nprofiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller\nencompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and\nconsequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel\nchannel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal\ntraining pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable\nabsorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its\nsignal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly\nused by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase\nconfiguration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation\nalgorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the\nentire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank\nproperties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for\ncommunication systems at the FR3 band and above.

Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and\nreliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents\nand increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this\ncontext is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the\nreliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter\nvariations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may\naffect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In\nthis work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel\nimbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean\nsquares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to\nestimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected\ntargets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior\nknowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in\ncombination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed\nmethod suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the\nnormal operation of the radar.

From a coding viewpoint, the DL channel state acquired at\nthe users via DL training can be seen as an information source that must be\nconveyed to the base station via the UL communication channels. The\ntransmission of a source through a channel can be accomplished either by\nseparate or joint source-channel coding (SSCC or JSCC). In this work, using\nclassical remote distortion-rate (DR) theory, we first provide a theoretical\nlower bound on the channel estimation mean-square-error (MSE) of both JSCC and\nSSCC-based feedback schemes, which however requires encoding of large blocks of\nsuccessive channel states and thus cannot be used in practicesince it would\nincur in an extremely large feedback delay. We then focus on the relevant case\nof minimal (one slot) feedback delay and propose a practical JSCC-based\nfeedback scheme that fully exploits the channel second-order statistics to\noptimize the dimension projection in the eigenspace.

Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the\nunique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel\nestimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel\nestimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel\nestimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated\nis decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent\nchannel.

The architecture incorporates a single or multiple\nradio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase\nprofiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller\nencompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and\nconsequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel\nchannel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal\ntraining pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable\nabsorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its\nsignal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly\nused by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase\nconfiguration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation\nalgorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the\nentire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank\nproperties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for\ncommunication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical\ninvestigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation\ntechnique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware\nconfiguration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel\nestimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized\nreflection coefficients of its unit elements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u65e0\u6e90\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\uff09\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7RIS\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MIMO\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6bb5\uff08\u5982FR3\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5355/\u591a\u5c04\u9891\u94fe\u63a5\u6536\u5bfc\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u5438\u6536\u76f8\u4f4d\u5256\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528ADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316RIS\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cRIS\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316RIS\u5355\u5143\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u53cd\u5c04\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9891\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and\nreliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents\nand increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this\ncontext is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the\nreliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter\nvariations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may\naffect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In\nthis work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel\nimbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean\nsquares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to\nestimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected\ntargets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior\nknowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in\ncombination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed\nmethod suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the\nnormal operation of the radar. Furthermore, it features reduced dependency on\nspecific targets of interest and faster update rates of the channel imbalance\nestimation compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods. This\nimprovement is achieved by allowing for multiple targets in the angular\nspectrum, whereas most other methods are restricted to only single targets in\nthe angular spectrum. The performance of the proposed method is validated using\nvarious simulation scenarios and is supported by measurement results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eNLMS\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6c7d\u8f66\u96f7\u8fbe\u901a\u9053\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5bf9ADAS\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u901a\u9053\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u96f7\u8fbe\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528NLMS\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u5904\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u89d2\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u7387\u5feb\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u96f7\u8fbe\u901a\u9053\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}
