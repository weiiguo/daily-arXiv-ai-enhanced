### [1] [Dual-Domain Deep Learning-Assisted NOMA-CSK Systems for Secure and Efficient Vehicular Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24763)
*Tingting Huang,Jundong Chen,Huanqiang Zeng,Guofa Cai,Georges Kaddoum*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的功率域非正交多址混沌移位键控系统，用于解决车载通信中多用户传输的安全性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车载通信系统中的多用户混沌通信存在频谱效率低、用户连接数有限、计算复杂度高等问题，需要更高效安全的解决方案。

Method: 设计了基于深度神经网络的解调器，采用双域特征提取架构联合处理时域和频域信息，并集成到连续干扰消除框架中。

Abstract: Ensuring secure and efficient multi-user (MU) transmission is critical for
vehicular communication systems. Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered
considerable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security.
However, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those
based on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to
reference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal
multiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code
multiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high
computational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook
designs. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain
non-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for
vehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is
designed to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline
training, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference
signal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction
architecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain
information of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic
channels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation
(SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and
extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior
performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit
error rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower
computational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided
schemes. These advantages validate its practical viability for secure vehicular
communications.

### [2] [Resi-VidTok: An Efficient and Decomposed Progressive Tokenization Framework for Ultra-Low-Rate and Lightweight Video Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25002)
*Zhenyu Liu,Yi Ma,Rahim Tafazolli,Zhi Ding*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Resi-VidTok是一个用于超低速率轻量级视频传输的弹性令牌化框架，通过将时空内容重组为离散的重要性排序令牌流，在受限信道条件下实现渐进编码、前缀可解码重建和优雅质量降级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限带宽和弱连接等严重信道条件下，通过无线网络实时传输视频仍然极具挑战性，需要开发能够保持感知和语义保真度的鲁棒传输方案。

Method: 采用弹性1D令牌化流水线，整合差分时间令牌编码，支持从不完整令牌集可靠恢复；结合步长控制帧稀疏化和轻量级解码器侧插值器减少传输负载；使用信道自适应信源-信道编码和调制方案。

Result: 在低至0.0004的信道带宽比下仍能保持鲁棒的视觉和语义一致性，实时重建速度超过30fps，适用于能效敏感、延迟敏感和可靠性关键的无线应用。

Conclusion: Resi-VidTok框架展示了在恶劣信道条件下实现超低速率视频传输的实用性，为无线视频传输提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time transmission of video over wireless networks remains highly
challenging, even with advanced deep models, particularly under severe channel
conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we
propose Resi-VidTok, a Resilient Tokenization-Enabled framework designed for
ultra-low-rate and lightweight video transmission that delivers strong
robustness while preserving perceptual and semantic fidelity on commodity
digital hardware. By reorganizing spatio--temporal content into a discrete,
importance-ordered token stream composed of key tokens and refinement tokens,
Resi-VidTok enables progressive encoding, prefix-decodable reconstruction, and
graceful quality degradation under constrained channels. A key contribution is
a resilient 1D tokenization pipeline for video that integrates differential
temporal token coding, explicitly supporting reliable recovery from incomplete
token sets using a single shared framewise decoder--without auxiliary temporal
extractors or heavy generative models. Furthermore, stride-controlled frame
sparsification combined with a lightweight decoder-side interpolator reduces
transmission load while maintaining motion continuity. Finally, a
channel-adaptive source--channel coding and modulation scheme dynamically
allocates rate and protection according to token importance and channel
condition, yielding stable quality across adverse SNRs. Evaluation results
indicate robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios
(CBR) as low as 0.0004 and real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps,
demonstrating the practicality of Resi-VidTok for energy-efficient,
latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless applications.

### [3] [Fed-PELAD: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for Massive MIMO CSI Feedback with Personalized Encoders and a LoRA-Adapted Shared Decoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25181)
*Yixiang Zhou,Tong Wu,Meixia Tao,Jianhua Mo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出Fed-PELAD联邦学习框架，通过个性化编码器和LoRA适配共享解码器，解决大规模MIMO系统中CSI反馈的通信开销、数据异构性和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中CSI反馈面临的通信开销大、数据异构性强和隐私保护需求等关键挑战。

Method: 采用个性化编码器在用户设备本地训练捕捉设备特定特征，通过LoRA适配的共享解码器进行全局更新，仅传输紧凑的LoRA适配器参数，并引入交替冻结策略和校准学习率比。

Result: 在3GPP标准信道模型上的仿真显示，相比传统方法，Fed-PELAD仅需42.97%的上行通信成本，在异构条件下CSI反馈精度提升1.2 dB。

Conclusion: Fed-PELAD框架有效降低了通信开销，提升了CSI反馈性能，同时保护了用户隐私。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenges of communication overhead, data
heterogeneity, and privacy in deep learning for channel state information (CSI)
feedback in massive MIMO systems. To this end, we propose Fed-PELAD, a novel
federated learning framework that incorporates personalized encoders and a
LoRA-adapted shared decoder. Specifically, personalized encoders are trained
locally on each user equipment (UE) to capture device-specific channel
characteristics, while a shared decoder is updated globally via the
coordination of the base station (BS) by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This
design ensures that only compact LoRA adapter parameters instead of full model
updates are transmitted for aggregation. To further enhance convergence
stability, we introduce an alternating freezing strategy with calibrated
learning-rate ratio during LoRA aggregation. Extensive simulations on
3GPP-standard channel models demonstrate that Fed-PELAD requires only 42.97\%
of the uplink communication cost compared to conventional methods while
achieving a performance gain of 1.2 dB in CSI feedback accuracy under
heterogeneous conditions.

### [4] [Joint Spatial Registration and Resource Allocation for Transmissive RIS Enabled Cooperative ISCC Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25266)
*Ziwei Liu,Wen Chen,Zhendong Li,Qiong Wu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型透射式可重构智能表面(TRIS)收发器驱动的协作集成感知、计算和通信(ISCC)网络，通过联合优化波束成形、时隙分配、感知数据分配和感知波束调度，实现网络总能耗最小化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足多样化网络需求并降低能耗，需要设计一种高效的协作网络架构，能够同时完成感知数据采集、通信卸载和计算任务。

Method: 采用信号级空间配准算法调整波束宽度，引入多流通信和秩-N约束，使用迭代秩最小化(IRM)方案，并通过块坐标下降(BCD)方案解决非凸优化问题。

Result: 数值仿真结果表明，所提方案在提高整体网络性能和降低网络总能耗方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: TRIS驱动的协作ISCC网络能够有效降低能耗并提升网络性能，为未来多样化网络需求提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent
surface (TRIS) transceiver-driven cooperative integrated sensing, computing,
and communication (ISCC) network to meet the requirement for a diverse network
with low energy consumption. The cooperative base stations (BSs) are equipped
with TRIS transceivers to accomplish sensing data acquisition, communication
offloading, and computation in a time slot. In order to obtain higher
cooperation gain, we utilize a signal-level spatial registration algorithm,
which is realized by adjusting the beamwidth. Meanwhile, for more efficient
offloading of the computational task, multistream communication is considered,
and rank-$N$ constraints are introduced, which are handled using an iterative
rank minimization (IRM) scheme. We construct an optimization problem with the
objective function of minimizing the total energy consumption of the network to
jointly optimize the beamforming matrix, time slot allocation, sensing data
allocation and sensing beam scheduling variables. Due to the coupling of the
variables, the proposed problem is a non-convex optimization problem, which we
decouple and solve using a block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme. Finally,
numerical simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme in
improving the overall network performance and reducing the total energy
consumption of the network.

### [5] [General Coverage Models: Structure, Monotonicity, and Shotgun Sequencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25305)
*Yitzchak Grunbaum,Eitan Yaakobi*

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受鸟枪DNA测序启发，研究更一般的覆盖过程模型，其中每次抽取显示多个项目而非单个项目，特别是固定长度窗口模型。

Method: 开发统一组合工具，将覆盖时间计算从概率问题转化为对包含所有项目的子集族的计数问题。分析窗口模型、均匀ℓ-正则模型和批量采样模型。

Result: 获得了窗口模型的精确表达式，分析了渐近行为。证明了均匀ℓ-正则模型的上界，发现许多采样模型具有相同的主导渐近阶但低阶项可能显著不同。

Conclusion: 开发了统一的组合框架来分析覆盖过程，证明了批量采样模型在均匀ℓ-正则模型中可能最大化覆盖时间，并建立了普遍上界揭示了采样模型的渐近行为特征。

Abstract: We study coverage processes in which each draw reveals a subset of $[n]$, and
the goal is to determine the expected number of draws until all items are seen
at least once. A classical example is the Coupon Collector's Problem, where
each draw reveals exactly one item. Motivated by shotgun DNA sequencing, we
introduce a model where each draw is a contiguous window of fixed length, in
both cyclic and non-cyclic variants. We develop a unifying combinatorial tool
that shifts the task of finding coverage time from probability, to a counting
problem over families of subsets of $[n]$ that together contain all items,
enabling exact calculation. Using this result, we obtain exact expressions for
the window models. We then leverage past results on a continuous analogue of
the cyclic window model to analyze the asymptotic behavior of both models. We
further study what we call uniform $\ell$-regular models, where every draw has
size $\ell$ and every item appears in the same number of admissible draws. We
compare these to the batch sampling model, in which all $\ell$-subsets are
drawn uniformly at random and present upper and lower bounds, which were also
obtained independently by Berend and Sher. We conjecture, and prove for special
cases, that this model maximizes the coverage time among all uniform
$\ell$-regular models. Finally, we prove a universal upper bound on the entire
class of uniform $\ell$-regular models, which illuminates the fact that many
sampling models share the same leading asymptotic order, while potentially
differing significantly in lower-order terms.

### [6] [Network Oblivious Transfer via Noisy Broadcast Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25343)
*Hadi Aghaee,Christian Deppe,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用噪声广播信道作为多用户隐私保护通信的强大原语，构建连接网络信息论和密码学安全的理论框架。

Method: 提出了两种不经意传输协议：第一种针对独立非共谋接收者，利用二进制擦除广播信道结构；第二种针对共谋接收者，引入额外的熵共享和隐私放大机制。

Result: 对于非共谋情况，不经意传输容量的上界和下界重合，完全刻画了可达区域。

Conclusion: 这项工作为网络信息论和密码学安全提供了统一的理论框架，展示了噪声广播信道作为多用户隐私保护通信原语的潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates information-theoretic oblivious transfer via a
discrete memoryless broadcast channel with one sender and two receivers. We
analyze both non-colluding and colluding honest-but-curious user models and
establish general upper bounds on the achievable oblivious transfer capacity
region for each case. Two explicit oblivious transfer protocols are proposed.
The first ensures correctness and privacy for independent, non-colluding
receivers by leveraging the structure of binary erasure broadcast channels. The
second protocol, secure even under receiver collusion, introduces additional
entropy-sharing and privacy amplification mechanisms to preserve secrecy
despite information leakage between users. Our results show that for the
non-colluding case, the upper and lower bounds on oblivious transfer capacity
coincide, providing a complete characterization of the achievable region. The
work provides a unified theoretical framework bridging network information
theory and cryptographic security, highlighting the potential of noisy
broadcast channels as powerful primitives for multi-user privacy-preserving
communication.

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted full-duplex (FD) terahertz
(THz) communication systems have emerged as a promising paradigm to satisfy the
escalating demand for ultra-high data rates and spectral efficiency in future
wireless networks. However, the practical deployment of such systems presents
unique technical challenges, stemming from severe propagation loss,
frequency-dependent molecular absorption in the THz band, and the presence of
strong residual self-interference (SI) inherent to FD communications. To tackle
these issues, this paper proposes a joint resource allocation framework that
aims to maximize the weighted minimum rate among all users, thereby ensuring
fairness in quality of service. Specifically, the proposed design jointly
optimizes IRS reflecting phase shifts, uplink/downlink transmit power control,
sub-band bandwidth allocation, and sub-band assignment, explicitly capturing
the unique propagation characteristics of THz channels and the impact of
residual SI. To strike an balance between system performance and computational
complexity, two computationally efficient algorithms are developed under
distinct spectrum partitioning schemes: one assumes equal sub-band bandwidth
allocation to facilliate tractable optimization, while the other introduces
adaptive bandwidth allocation to further enhance spectral utilization and
system flexibility. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed designs and demonstrate that the adopted scheme achieves significant
spectral efficiency improvements over benchmark schemes.

### [8] [AirCNN via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Architecture Design and Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25389)
*Meng Hua,Haotian Wu,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: AirCNN是一种通过空中模拟计算实现卷积神经网络的新范式，利用可重构智能表面(RIS)和收发器设计，使无线传播环境模拟CNN层操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用无线环境本身进行神经网络计算的可能性，减少传统数字计算的开销，实现更高效的CNN实现方式。

Method: 提出两种RIS辅助传输架构：MIMO和MISO，用于实现2D卷积；扩展至深度可分离卷积，需要不同的传输策略；联合优化发射预编码器、接收组合器和RIS相移。

Result: 仿真结果表明AirCNN架构能实现满意的分类性能，Conv2d MISO在各种设置下始终优于Conv2d MIMO；对于ConvSD，MISO仅在信道条件差时更优；多RIS相比单RIS显著提升性能，特别是在视距主导环境中。

Conclusion: AirCNN证明了通过OTA模拟计算实现CNN的可行性，多RIS架构在无线环境中能有效提升性能，为无线神经网络计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces AirCNN, a novel paradigm for implementing convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) via over-the-air (OTA) analog computation. By leveraging
multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and transceiver designs, we
engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the operations
of a CNN layer. To comprehensively evaluate AirCNN, we consider two types of
CNNs, namely classic two-dimensional (2D) convolution (Conv2d) and light-weight
convolution, i.e., depthwise separable convolution (ConvSD). For Conv2d
realization via OTA computation, we propose and analyze two RIS-aided
transmission architectures: multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and
multiple-input single-output (MISO), balancing transmission overhead and
emulation performance. We jointly optimize all parameters, including the
transmitter precoder, receiver combiner, and RIS phase shifts, under practical
constraints such as transmit power budget and unit-modulus phase shift
requirements. We further extend the framework to ConvSD, which requires
distinct transmission strategies for depthwise and pointwise convolutions.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AirCNN architectures can
achieve satisfactory classification performance. Notably, Conv2d MISO
consistently outperforms Conv2d MIMO across various settings, while for ConvSD,
MISO is superior only under poor channel conditions. Moreover, employing
multiple RISs significantly enhances performance compared to a single RIS,
especially in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated wireless environments.

### [9] [Several classes of $p$-ary linear codes with few-weights derived from Weil sums](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25578)
*Mrinal Kanti Bose,Abhay Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.IT

Abstract: Linear codes with few weights have been a significant area of research in
coding theory for many years, due to their applications in secret sharing
schemes, authentication codes, association schemes, and strongly regular
graphs. Inspired by the works of Cheng and Gao \cite{P8} and Wu, Li and Zeng
\cite{P12}, in this paper, we propose several new classes of few-weight linear
codes over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ through the selection of two
specific defining sets. Consequently, we obtain five classes of $4$-weight
linear codes and one class of $2$-weight linear codes from our first defining
set. Furthermore, by employing weakly regular bent functions in our second
defining set, we derive two classes of $6$-weight codes, two classes of
$8$-weight codes, and one class of $9$-weight codes. The parameters and weight
distributions of all these constructed codes are wholly determined by detailed
calculations on certain Weil sums over finite fields. In addition, we identify
an optimal class of $2$-weight codes that meet the Griesmer bound.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多维码在纠正权重最多为2的突发错误时的性能，特别关注错误位置之间的相对位置限制对编码效率的影响。

Method: 针对三种不同的位置限制情况（L∞距离有界、L1距离有界、两个错误位置在轴平行线上且距离有界）提供了明确的编码构造方法。

Result: 为所有三种情况提供了具体的编码构造方案，并将这些构造的冗余度与证明的下界进行了比较分析。

Conclusion: 论文为三种不同位置限制条件下的多维码提供了有效的构造方法，并通过与理论下界的比较验证了这些构造的性能。

Abstract: We consider multidimensional codes capable of correcting a burst error of
weight at most $2$. When two positions are in error, the burst limits their
relative position. We study three such limitations: the $L_\infty$ distance
between the positions is bounded, the $L_1$ distance between the positions is
bounded, or the two positions are on an axis-parallel line with bounded
distance between them. In all cases we provide explicit code constructions, and
compare their excess redundancy to a lower bound we prove.

Motivation: 研究图复制数据库设置下的SPIR问题，旨在量化相比图复制公共随机性设置下SPIR容量的改进，满足数据库隐私保护需求。

Method: 开发了一种算法，将一类PIR方案转换为相应的SPIR方案，从而为存在此类方案的图建立容量下界。特别关注路径图和循环图。

Result: 为路径图和循环图推导了比各自PIR容量给出的平凡界限更紧的容量上界。对于三顶点路径图，确定了SPIR容量为1/2。

Conclusion: 提出的转换算法成功建立了图复制数据库SPIR的容量下界，并在特定图结构下获得了精确的容量结果，为图复制环境中的隐私保护信息检索提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) in
settings where the database replication is modeled by a simple graph. Here,
each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers
if and only if there is an edge between them. To satisfy the requirement of
database privacy, we let all the servers share some common randomness,
independent of the messages. We aim to quantify the improvement in SPIR
capacity, i.e., the maximum ratio of the number of desired and downloaded
symbols, compared to the setting with graph-replicated common randomness.
Towards this, we develop an algorithm to convert a class of PIR schemes into
the corresponding SPIR schemes, thereby establishing a capacity lower bound on
graphs for which such schemes exist. This includes the class of path and cyclic
graphs for which we derive capacity upper bounds that are tighter than the
trivial bounds given by the respective PIR capacities. For the special case of
path graph with three vertices, we identify the SPIR capacity to be
$\frac{1}{2}$.

Method: 通过公理化方法，从三个不同角度（相对熵、Jensen不等式差距、广义Bregman散度的对数散度）对超额增长率进行特征化。

Result: 建立了超额增长率与信息论多个核心概念的联系，提供了三个特征定理，并研究了超额增长率最大化与最优增长投资组合的关系。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为超额增长率的重要性提供了理论依据，还在信息论与量化金融之间建立了新的联系。

Abstract: We study the excess growth rate -- a fundamental logarithmic functional
arising in portfolio theory -- from the perspective of information theory. We
show that the excess growth rate can be connected to the R\'{e}nyi and cross
entropies, the Helmholtz free energy, L. Campbell's measure of average code
length and large deviations. Our main results consist of three axiomatic
characterization theorems of the excess growth rate, in terms of (i) the
relative entropy, (ii) the gap in Jensen's inequality, and (iii) the
logarithmic divergence that generalizes the Bregman divergence. Furthermore, we
study maximization of the excess growth rate and compare it with the growth
optimal portfolio. Our results not only provide theoretical justifications of
the significance of the excess growth rate, but also establish new connections
between information theory and quantitative finance.

### [13] [Distributed learning for automatic modulation recognition in bandwidth-limited networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24722)
*Narges Rashvand,Kenneth Witham,Gabriel Maldonado,Vinit Katariya,Aly Sultan,Gunar Schirner,Hamed Tabkhi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种基于分布式学习的自动调制识别方法，通过多个接收器协作来降低带宽需求，同时保持较高的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式AMR方法需要将所有训练数据收集到高性能计算设备上处理，这在带宽受限的无线网络中不实用。

Method: 提出了两种分布式学习方法：1）基于共识投票的方法，六个接收器协作决策；2）特征图共享方法，接收器共享特征图并由中心节点聚合。

Result: 集中式方法准确率达91%，单个接收器仅41%。分布式方法在显著降低带宽需求的同时，准确率接近集中式方法，带宽需求分别降至1/256和1/8。

Conclusion: 分布式AMR方法能够在带宽受限的无线网络中显著提高识别准确率，有效解决了集中式方法的局限性。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is critical in identifying various
modulation types in wireless communication systems. Recent advancements in deep
learning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.
However, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that
necessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered
computing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless
networks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for
distributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to
perform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this
investigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this
distributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying
modulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective
of the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the
centralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate
of 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around
41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods
exhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,
the initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while
substantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized
model. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature
map, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies
a substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach.
These findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly
enhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of
bandwidth-limited wireless networks.

conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed position
elements, FRIS employs fluidic elements that can dynamically adjust their
positions, offering enhanced spatial adaptability. We develop a system model
where an AmBC tag communicates with a reader through an FRIS, which is
particularly beneficial in scenarios where the direct tag-to-reader link is
weak or blocked by obstacles. The achievable backscatter rate is analyzed, and
the optimization of FRIS element positions is formulated as a non-convex
problem. To address this, we employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain
near-optimal configurations of the fluid elements. Simulation results
demonstrate that FRIS-aided AmBC significantly outperforms conventional
RIS-based AmBC systems in terms of achievable throughput.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种创新方法，使用大型语言模型从多媒体记录中提取上下文数据，结合生理指标分析城市骑行环境中情绪状态对骑行者行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于自我报告的情绪测量方法存在粒度低和记忆偏差问题，而生理指标虽然能提供连续数据，但缺乏足够的上下文信息来解释情绪变化的原因。

Method: 从智利圣地亚哥城市骑行案例研究中收集数据，使用LLM处理视频中提取的图像序列获得环境语义描述，将这些上下文数据整合到混合模型中，其中疲劳和兴奋作为潜在变量影响骑行行为。

Result: 研究证实骑行决策受到压力相关情绪的影响，并强调了城市特征和交通条件对骑行者行为的强烈影响。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了在真实环境中获取足够上下文数据的挑战，为理解情绪状态与骑行行为之间的关系提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Measuring emotional states in transportation contexts is an emerging field.
Methods based on self-reported emotions are limited by their low granularity
and their susceptibility to memory bias. In contrast, methods based on
physiological indicators provide continuous data, enabling researchers to
measure changes in emotional states with high detail and accuracy. Not only are
emotions important in the analysis, but understanding what triggers emotional
changes is equally important. Uncontrolled variables such as traffic
conditions, pedestrian interactions, and infrastructure remain a significant
challenge, as they can have a great impact on emotional states. Explaining the
reasons behind these emotional states requires gathering sufficient and proper
contextual data, which can be extremely difficult in real-world environments.
This paper addresses these challenges by applying an innovative approach,
extracting contextual data (expert annotator level) from recorded multimedia
using large language models (LLMs). In this paper, data are collected from an
urban cycling case study of the City of Santiago, Chile. The applied models
focus on understanding how different environments and traffic situations affect
the emotional states and behaviors of the participants using physiological
data. Sequences of images, extracted from the recorded videos, are processed by
LLMs to obtain semantic descriptions of the environment. These discrete,
although dense and detailed, contextual data are integrated into a hybrid
model, where fatigue and arousal serve as latent variables influencing observed
cycling behaviors (inferred from GPS data) like waiting, accelerating, braking,
etc. The study confirms that cycling decisions are influenced by stress-related
emotions and highlights the strong impact of urban characteristics and traffic
conditions on cyclist behavior.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for enhancing wireless networks. Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on
building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the
inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may
lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance.
To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme
that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging
the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy
consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS),
we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS
beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control
nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the
problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm
with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies.
Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling
and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance,
achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison
to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive
trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS
tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.

Abstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain
signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG),
focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate
what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert
speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The
thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work.
A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in
electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or
between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset
variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep
learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli
using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep
learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods
to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel
forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based
architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior
capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby
enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's
electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset
containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped
magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner
speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and
sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be
mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跑步有益健康但不正确的步态模式会导致损伤，现有步态分析系统笨重且只能离线分析，腕戴设备更实用但实时步态识别面临IMU信号噪声、计算资源有限和依赖云连接的挑战。

Method: 提出四种紧凑的深度学习架构（1D-CNN、1D-SepCNN、LSTM和Transformer），在AMD Spartan-7和Lattice iCE40UP5K FPGA上优化能效推理，使用自定义硬件原型收集户外跑步数据集并通过自动化部署管道评估模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型复杂度和硬件效率之间的权衡，1D-SepCNN在嵌入式FPGA上实现了高效的实时步态识别，为跑步者提供了实用的自我纠正工具。

Abstract: Running offers substantial health benefits, but improper gait patterns can
lead to injuries, particularly without expert feedback. While prior gait
analysis systems based on cameras, insoles, or body-mounted sensors have
demonstrated effectiveness, they are often bulky and limited to offline,
post-run analysis. Wrist-worn wearables offer a more practical and
non-intrusive alternative, yet enabling real-time gait recognition on such
devices remains challenging due to noisy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
signals, limited computing resources, and dependence on cloud connectivity.
This paper introduces StrikeWatch, a compact wrist-worn system that performs
entirely on-device, real-time gait recognition using IMU signals. As a case
study, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable
runners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory
feedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN,
1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient
inference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our
custom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor
running sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment
pipeline. Our results reveal clear trade-offs between model complexity and
hardware efficiency. Evaluated across 12 participants, 6-bit quantized
1D-SepCNN achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.847 while consuming just
0.350 {\mu}J per inference with a latency of 0.140 ms on the iCE40UP5K running
at 20 MHz. This configuration supports up to 13.6 days of continuous inference
on a 320 mAh battery. All datasets and code are available in the GitHub

TL;DR: STAR是一种心电信号增强方法，通过在R峰之间进行时间扭曲和幅度缩放来增加训练多样性，同时保持临床关键形态特征不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床12导联心电图分类面临记录条件多样、病理重叠和标签不平衡等挑战，传统增强方法可能扭曲诊断关键形态。

Method: 提出正弦时间-幅度重采样(STAR)，在连续R峰之间进行受控时间扭曲和幅度缩放，保持P-QRS-T顺序不变。

Result: STAR提供了形态保真度高的变异性，提高了跨设备、站点和队列的稳定性，并改善了罕见类别的学习效果。

Conclusion: STAR为临床ECG分类提供了一种简单可控的增强方法，在形态可信度、操作简单性和跨源耐久性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Clinical 12-lead ECG classification remains difficult because of diverse
recording conditions, overlapping pathologies, and pronounced label imbalance
hinder generalization, while unconstrained augmentations risk distorting
diagnostically critical morphology. In this study, Sinusoidal Time--Amplitude
Resampling (STAR) is introduced as a beat-wise augmentation that operates
strictly between successive R-peaks to apply controlled time warping and
amplitude scaling to each R--R segment, preserving the canonical P--QRS--T
order and leaving the head and tail of the trace unchanged. STAR is designed
for practical pipelines and offers: (i) morphology-faithful variability that
broadens training diversity without corrupting peaks or intervals; (ii)
source-resilient training, improving stability across devices, sites, and
cohorts without dataset-specific tuning; (iii) model-agnostic integration with
common 1D SE--ResNet-style ECG encoders backbone; and (iv) better learning on
rare classes via beat-level augmentation, reducing overfitting by resampling
informative beats instead of duplicating whole records. In contrast to global
crops, large shifts, or additive noise, STAR avoids transformations that
suppress or misalign clinical landmarks. A complete Python implementation and a
transparent training workflow are released, aligned with a source-aware,
stratified five-fold protocol over a multi-institutional 12-lead corpus,
thereby facilitating inspection and reuse. Taken together, STAR provides a
simple and controllable augmentation for clinical ECG classification where
trustworthy morphology, operational simplicity, and cross-source durability are
essential.

Abstract: Non-intrusive monitoring of vital signs has become increasingly important in
a variety of healthcare settings. In this paper, we present PulseFi, a novel
low-cost non-intrusive system that uses Wi-Fi sensing and artificial
intelligence to accurately and continuously monitor heart rate and breathing
rate, as well as detect apnea events. PulseFi operates using low-cost commodity
devices, making it more accessible and cost-effective. It uses a signal
processing pipeline to process Wi-Fi telemetry data, specifically Channel State
Information (CSI), that is fed into a custom low-compute Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) neural network model. We evaluate PulseFi using two datasets: one that
we collected locally using ESP32 devices and another that contains recordings
of 118 participants collected using the Raspberry Pi 4B, making the latter the
most comprehensive data set of its kind. Our results show that PulseFi can
effectively estimate heart rate and breathing rate in a seemless non-intrusive
way with comparable or better accuracy than multiple antenna systems that can
be expensive and less accessible.

Motivation: 现有CNN分类器难以选择适合ECG长序列的感受野大小，而Omni Scale CNN虽然能覆盖所有尺度但计算成本过高，阻碍了更深更宽的模型设计。

Method: 提出分层变体EcoScaleNet，在每个阶段限制最大核长度，并在Omni Scale块前后插入瓶颈卷积来限制通道增长和融合多尺度特征。

Result: 在CODE 15% ECG数据集上，相比OS CNN减少90%参数和99%FLOPs，同时将宏平均F1分数提升2.4%。

Conclusion: EcoScaleNet以极低的计算成本实现了长序列ECG分类的最先进精度，使得在普通硬件上实时部署成为可能。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
early detection of cardiac abnormalities, yet manual reading is error prone and
existing CNN based classifiers struggle to choose receptive field sizes that
generalize to the long sequences typical of ECGs. Omni Scale CNN (OS CNN)
addresses this by enumerating prime sized kernels inspired by Goldbach
conjecture to cover every scale, but its exhaustive design explodes
computational cost and blocks deeper, wider models. We present Efficient
Convolutional Omni Scale Network (EcoScale-Net), a hierarchical variant that
retains full receptive field coverage while eliminating redundancy. At each
stage, the maximum kernel length is capped to the scale still required after
down sampling, and bottleneck convolutions inserted before and after every Omni
Scale block curtail channel growth and fuse multi scale features. On the large
scale CODE 15% ECG dataset, EcoScaleNet reduces parameters by 90% and FLOPs by
99% compared with OS CNN, while raising macro averaged F1 score by 2.4%. These
results demonstrate that EcoScaleNet delivers SOTA accuracy for long sequence
ECG classification at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling real time
deployment on commodity hardware. Our EcoScaleNet code is available in GitHub

Conclusion: 这项大规模真实世界研究表明，单导联AI-ECG系统能够实现高效实用的WPW综合征机会性筛查，显著减少医生工作量并支持基于人群的心血管预防。

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a congenital cardiac condition
associated with sudden cardiac death, with a prevalence of 0.1-0.3%.
Conventional screening relies on electrophysiological testing or 12-lead
electrocardiography interpreted by cardiologists, which limits large-scale and
cost-effective screening. Building on our previous work developing a
single-lead AI-ECG mobile system for atrial fibrillation screening, this study
evaluates its efficiency and effectiveness for opportunistic detection of WPW
syndrome in real-world settings. This retrospective analysis included 3,566,626
single-lead ECG recordings from 87,836 individuals in China, collected using
the NMPA-approved portable ECG device WenXinWuYang. The AI system performance
was validated using cardiologist annotations and random sampling. We quantified
AI-assisted workload reduction and compared review efficiency across
AI-positive and user-initiated workflows. The AI system achieved 45.5%
sensitivity and 95.9% specificity. A positive AI result indicated about 210
times higher risk of confirmed WPW. Focusing on AI-selected positives reduced
physician workload by 99.5%, requiring only 12 reviews to confirm one WPW case,
compared with 909 and 875 in population-wide and user-driven approaches. In
conclusion, this large-scale real-world study demonstrates that a single-lead
AI-ECG system enables efficient and practical opportunistic screening for WPW
syndrome, significantly reducing physician workload and supporting
population-based cardiovascular prevention.

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables biocompatible and energy-efficient
information transfer through chemical signaling, forming a foundational
paradigm for emerging applications in the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and
intrabody healthcare systems. The realization of this vision critically depends
on developing advanced receiver architectures that merge nanoscale
communication and networking techniques with bio-cyber interfaces, ensuring
energy-efficient, reliable, and low-complexity modulation and detection while
maintaining biocompatibility. To address these challenges, the Flexure-FET MC
receiver was introduced as a mechanically transducing design capable of
detecting both charged and neutral molecular species. In this study, we present
a cylindrical nanowire array-based Flexure-FET MC receiver that enhances design
versatility and scalability through distributed electromechanical coupling in a
suspended-gate configuration. The proposed array architecture offers additional
geometric degrees of freedom, including nanowire radius, length, spacing, and
array size, providing a flexible framework that can be tailored to advanced MC
scenarios. An analytical end-to-end model is developed to characterize the
system's electromechanical response, noise behavior, and information-theoretic
performance, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel capacity. The
results reveal the strong interdependence between geometry, electromechanical
dynamics, and molecular binding processes, enabling tunable control over
sensitivity, noise characteristics, and communication capacity. The enhanced
structural tunability and array configuration of the proposed design provide a
flexible foundation for future mixture-based and spatially modulated MC
systems, paving the way toward scalable and multifunctional receiver
architectures within the IoNT framework.

Motivation: 工业网络物理系统中连接设备数量激增，需要可靠和及时的网络服务来支持具有不同优先级的多样化应用。

Method: DyFrag-MAC通过动态分段正常优先级数据，允许紧急优先级数据抢占正在进行的低优先级传输，实现差异化信道访问。

Result: 与FROG-MAC和i-DSME相比，DyFrag-MAC在平均延迟和吞吐量方面表现更好，特别适用于异构流量场景。

Conclusion: DyFrag-MAC通过动态分段机制有效解决了工业CPS中多优先级流量的信道访问问题，提供了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Next Generation Media Access Control (NGMA) techniques have been designed to
support diverse applications with heterogeneous priorities. In industrial
cyber-physical systems (CPS), the number of connected devices and systems is
expected to grow significantly, demanding dependable and prompt network
services. In this work, we present a novel scheme, Dynamic Fragmentation-MAC
(DyFrag-MAC) that offers dynamic, differentiated channel access to the traffic
of various priorities. DyFrag-MAC works on fragmenting the data of normal
priority in order to support early delivery of urgent priority data. In prior
work, urgent priority data either had to wait for the complete transmission of
lower-priority packets or relied on multi-channel protocols to gain access. We
compared the proposed fragmentation scheme with FROG-MAC and industrial
Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (i-DSME). FROG-MAC
fragmented the lower priority packets, but did not adjust the fragment size
dynamically, whereas i-DSME utilized multiple channels and adaptive contention
mechanisms; both protocols lack the ability to preempt ongoing lower-priority
transmissions. Hence, the performance evaluation in terms of average delay and
throughput reveals better performance of DyFRAG-MAC for the heterogeneous
traffic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线体域网中异构流量优先级管理对可靠性、延迟和能效至关重要，需要针对不同优先级流量优化延迟。

Method: 使用概率方法动态确定信道轮询/监听间隔，识别流量到达模式确定最优轮询间隔，并在预期紧急数据包时中断低优先级传输。

Result: ADP2-MAC在性能上优于支持异构流量的MVDR协议，特别是在处理紧急优先级数据方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: ADP2-MAC通过概率轮询间隔和中断机制，能够有效支持无线体域网中的异构流量管理，提升整体性能。

Abstract: Efficient management of heterogeneous traffic with varying priorities is
critical in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). The priority mechanisms
embedded in Media Access Control (MAC) schemes largely govern the performance
of WBAN in terms of reliability, delay and energy efficiency. Minimizing the
delay between packet generation and reception is critical for enhancing WBAN
performance and associated health outcomes; however, delay optimization must be
tailored to each traffic priority. In this work, we proposed a novel
priority-based MAC protocol, Adaptive and Dynamic Polling MAC for Prioritized
Traffic (ADP2-MAC), designed to support heterogeneous traffic in WBANs. The
protocol utilizes a probabilistic approach to dynamically determine channel
polling/listening intervals. ADP2-MAC not only identifies traffic arrival
patterns to determine optimal polling intervals but also interrupts the
transmission of lower-priority data when urgent packets are expected. The
performance of ADP2-MAC has been compared with the MAC protocol for Variable
Data Rates (MVDR) which supports heterogeneous traffic by assigning different
data rates based on traffic priority. ADP2-MAC outperforms MVDR due to its use
of probabilistic polling intervals and an interruption mechanism designed to
efficiently handle urgent-priority data.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of tracking maneuvering objects with complex
motion patterns, a task in which conventional methods often struggle due to
their reliance on predefined motion models. We integrate a data-driven liquid
neural network (LNN) into the random finite set (RFS) framework, leading to two
LNN-RFS filters. By learning continuous-time dynamics directly from data, the
LNN enables the filters to adapt to complex, nonlinear motion and achieve
accurate tracking of highly maneuvering objects in clutter. This hybrid
approach preserves the inherent multi-object tracking strengths of the RFS
framework while improving flexibility and robustness. Simulation results on
challenging maneuvering scenarios demonstrate substantial gains of the proposed
hybrid approach in tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了用于夹持天线系统的联合发射和夹持波束成形设计，以权衡频谱效率和能量效率，适用于单用户和多用户场景，通过两阶段设计和交替优化方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在夹持天线系统中，需要平衡频谱效率和能量效率的性能，同时满足服务质量要求，现有的方法在这方面的优化不足。

Method: 单用户场景采用两阶段设计：第一阶段通过迭代闭式精化方案对齐接收信号相位并确定PA位置；第二阶段推导最优发射波束成形器。多用户场景采用基于交替优化的联合波束成形设计。

Result: 数值结果表明：1）所提算法显著提高了联合SE-EE性能且收敛速度快；2）随着PA数量和服务覆盖范围增加，PASS与传统多天线系统在SE-EE权衡区域的差距扩大。

Conclusion: 提出的联合波束成形设计有效解决了夹持天线系统中的SE-EE权衡问题，在单用户和多用户场景下均表现出优越性能，为未来无线通信系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The joint transmit and pinching beamforming design for spectral efficiency
(SE) and energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is
proposed. Both PASS-enabled single- and multi-user communications are
considered. In the single-user scenario, it is proved that the optimal pinching
antenna (PA) positions are independent of the transmit beamforming. Based on
this insight, a two-stage joint beamforming design is proposed. Specifically,
in the first stage, an iterative closed-form refinement (ICR) scheme is
proposed to align the phases of the received signals, based on which a PA
placement framework is proposed. In the second stage, the closed-form solution
for the optimal transmit beamformer is derived given the optimal PA positions.
In the multi-user scenario, an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint
beamforming design is proposed to balance the SE-EE performance while taking
the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements into account. It is proved that the
proposed AO-based algorithm is guaranteed to converge when no constraints are
violated in PA placement subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the
proposed algorithms significantly improve joint SE-EE performance with fast
convergence speed; 2) the SE-EE tradeoff regime gap between PASS and
conventional multi-antenna system widens as the number of PAs and service
coverage increase.

Conclusion: FA-Stateformer通过状态空间和自注意力的协同建模，在表示能力和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡，为声音到达方向估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is
challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across
time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the
ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies
effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model
performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention
collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first
employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across
both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight
Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where
the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter
overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand
the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel
size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba
module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of
temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining
self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a
collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation
capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to
conventional architectures.

Conclusion: 可移动天线技术能够显著提升ISAC系统的感知和通信性能，所提出的迭代算法能够高效解决高度非凸的联合优化问题。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution for the
future sixth-generation (6G) system. However, classical fixed-position antenna
(FPA) ISAC systems fail to fully utilize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs),
resulting in limited gains for both radar sensing and communication
functionalities. This challenge can be addressed by the emerging novel movable
antenna (MA) technology, which can pursue better channel conditions and improve
sensing and communication performances. In this paper, we aim to minimize the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's angle while guaranteeing
communication performance. This involves jointly optimizing active beamforming,
power allocation, receiving filters, and MA position configurations, which is a
highly non-convex problem. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an efficient
iterative solution that analytically optimizes all variables without relying on
numerical solvers, i.e., CVX. Specifically, by leveraging cutting-edge
majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods, we
develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve the beamformer configuration
problem containing the fractional and quartic terms. Numerical simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm,
highlighting significant performance improvements achieved by employing MA in
the ISAC system.

Abstract: This paper explores a multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink
communication system enabled by a unique transmissive reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) transceiver (TRTC) configuration. Within this system
framework, we formulate an optimization problem for the purpose of maximizing
the minimum rate of users for each cell via designing the transmit beamforming
of the TRTC, subject to the power constraints of each TRTC unit. Since the
objective function is non-differentiable, the max-min rate problem is difficult
to solve. In order to tackle this challenging optimization problem, an
efficient low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed. Specifically, the
log-form rate function is transformed into a tractable form by employing the
fractional programming (FP) methodology. Next, the max-min objective function
can be approximated using a differentiable function derived from smooth
approximation theory. Moreover, by applying the majorization-minimization (MM)
technique and examining the optimality conditions, a solution is proposed that
updates all variables analytically without relying on any numerical solvers.
Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and
effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm. Additionally, the
algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity without
performance loss. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate the clear
superiority of the deployment of the TRTC over the benchmark schemes.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of radar-based non-contact
respiratory monitoring for wombats. Two measurement experiments were conducted
in June and December 2024 using 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar systems to monitor
the respiration of two wombats. To estimate the respiratory interval, we used a
method based on summing harmonic components in the autocorrelation function,
capturing the quasi-periodic displacement of the body surface caused by
respiration. Estimation accuracy was evaluated through simultaneous
measurements from different angles using two radar units. The respiratory
interval and respiratory rate were measured with errors of 47.4 ms (2.44%) and
0.81 bpm (2.21%), respectively. We also discuss the differences in respiratory
rates between the two wombats, as well as seasonal variations between June and
December. The results support the potential application of this method to

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and
next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators
incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address
this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process
regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries,
thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is
defined by the covariance function, known as kernels. In the proposed GPR-based
CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis
function, Mat\'ern, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale
spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed
approach is evaluated across Kronecker and Weichselberger channel models with
three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with
50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical
95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of mutual information
relative to benchmarks. This enables up to 50% pilot reduction while preserving
over 92% of the link capacity.

Abstract: Satellite-based communications are expected to be a substantial future market
in 6G networks. As satellite constellations grow denser and transmission
resources remain limited, frequency reuse plays an increasingly important role
in managing inter-user interference. In the multi-user downlink, precoding
enables the reuse of frequencies across spatially separated users, greatly
improving spectral efficiency. The analytical calculation of suitable
precodings for perfect channel information is well studied, however, their
performance can quickly deteriorate when faced with, e.g., outdated channel
state information or, as is particularly relevant for satellite channels, when
position estimates are erroneous. Deriving robust precoders under imperfect
channel state information is not only analytically intractable in general but
often requires substantial relaxations of the optimization problem or heuristic
constraints to obtain feasible solutions. Instead, in this paper we flexibly
derive robust precoding algorithms from given data using reinforcement
learning. We describe how we adapt the applied Soft Actor-Critic learning
algorithm to the problem of downlink satellite beamforming and show numerically
that the resulting precoding algorithm adjusts to all investigated scenarios.
The considered scenarios cover both single satellite and cooperative
multi-satellite beamforming, using either global or local channel state
information, and two error models that represent increasing levels of
uncertainty. We show that the learned algorithms match or markedly outperform
two analytical baselines in sum rate performance, adapting to the required
level of robustness. We also analyze the mechanisms that the learned algorithms
leverage to achieve robustness. The implementation is publicly available for
use and reproduction of the results.

Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is
fundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems,
where intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and
efficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic
prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency.
To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E)
transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems.
The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver
through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or
time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter
(CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead
by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that
is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly
reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained
E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional
transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience
across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native
NextG.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) band is considered a promising candidate to meet the
high-throughput requirement for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless
communications due to its ultrawide bandwidth. However, due to the high
penetration loss at high-frequencies, blockage becomes a serious problem in THz
communications, especially in near-field indoor communications with numerous
obstacles. To address this issue, this paper investigates blockage-resilient
near-field beam training based on self-accelerating Airy beam, which can
propagate along a curved trajectory to circumvent obstacles. Specifically, we
first analyze the trajectory of the Airy beam and the beam pattern at the
receiver using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook in the presence of
obstacles. Interestingly, we reveal that the beam pattern not only captures the
receiver's location information but also implicitly encodes the spatial
relationship between the receiver and obstacle, which facilitates identifying
the optimal Airy beam configuration. Based on this insight, we formulate the
blockage-resilient beam training task as a multitask learning problem and
propose a lightweight attention-based multi-parameter beam training network
(AMPBT-Net) to jointly predict the angle, distance, and curvature parameters of
the optimal Airy beam based on the beam pattern. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate that the Airy beam effectively mitigates blockage effects and the
proposed scheme achieves comparable performance to exhaustive beam sweeping
while significantly reducing training overhead.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a dynamic radio frequency sensing system aiming to
spatially track multiple targets over time. We develop a conditional denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (C-DDPM)-assisted framework that learns the
temporal evolution of target parameters by leveraging the noisy echo
observations as conditioning features. The proposed framework integrates a
variational autoencoder (VAE) for echo compression and utilizes classifier-free
guidance to enhance conditional denoising. In each transmission block, VAE
encodes the received echo into a latent representation that conditions DDPM to
predict future target states, which are then used for codebook beam selection.
Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms classical signal
processing, filtering, and deep learning benchmarks. The C-DDPM-assisted
framework achieves significantly lower estimation errors in both angle and
distance tracking, demonstrating the potential of generative models for
integrated sensing and communications.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling, estimation, and feedback framework
for reconfigurable intelligent surface RIS-assisted optical wireless links. The
key modeling element is a long-exposure pixel gain that extends the classical
diffraction-limited response by statistically averaging angular jitter and
mispointing; it admits an exact real-integral form and captures boresight
attenuation and progressive sidelobe filling. The end-to-end system couples
free-space path loss, Beer--Lambert atmospheric extinction, pixel-level
diffraction, and optical efficiency with a unitary-pilot least-squares channel
estimator and quantized phase feedback. Analysis closely matches Monte Carlo
simulations and yields concrete design rules: with a surface of N=64 pixels,
pilot length $M=2N$, and pilot SNR=20 dB, the normalized mean-squared error
is0.005, implying an effective-SNR loss of about 0.5 and a capacity penalty of
0.007bits-s. Six-bit phase quantization introduces no measurable additional
penalty at these operating points, setting a practical benchmark for feedback
resolution. Training overhead scales strongly with pixel geometry: halving
pixel width (quartering pixel area) increases the pilot length required to
maintain the same NMSE by roughly fourfold. The framework reconciles
physical-optics modeling with estimation-and-feedback design and provides a
principled basis for scalable link budgeting in RIS-assisted optical networks.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler in 6G networks,
where sensing and communication capabilities are designed to complement and
enhance each other. One of the main challenges in ISAC lies in resource
allocation, which becomes computationally demanding in dynamic environments
requiring real-time adaptation. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL)-based approach for dynamic beamforming and power allocation in
ISAC systems. The DRL agent interacts with the environment and learns optimal
strategies through trial and error, guided by predefined rewards. Simulation
results show that the DRL-based solution converges within 2000 episodes and
achieves up to 80\% of the spectral efficiency of a semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) benchmark. More importantly, it offers a significant improvement in
runtime performance, achieving decision times of around 20 ms compared to 4500
ms for the SDR method. Furthermore, compared with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
benchmark employing discrete beamforming, the proposed approach achieves
approximately 30\% higher sum-rate with comparable runtime. These results
highlight the potential of DRL for enabling real-time, high-performance ISAC in
dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Motivated by Industry 4.0 applications, we consider quickest change detection
(QCD) of an abrupt change in a process when its measurements are transmitted by
a sensor over a lossy wireless link to a decision maker (DM). The sensor node
samples measurements using a Bernoulli sampling process, and places the
measurement samples in the transmit queue of its transmitter. The transmitter
uses a retransmit-until-success transmission strategy to deliver packets to the
DM over the lossy link, in which the packet losses are modeled as a Bernoulli
process, with different loss probabilities before and after the change. We pose
the QCD problem in the non-Bayesian setting under Lorden's framework, and
propose a CUSUM algorithm. By defining a suitable Markov process, involving the
DM measurements and the queue length process, we show that the problem reduces
to QCD in a Markov process. Characterizing the information measure per
measurement sample at the DM, we establish the asymptotic optimality of our
algorithm when the false alarm rate tends to zero. Further, when the DM
receives incomplete data due to channel loss, we present asymptotically optimal
QCD algorithms by suitably modifying the CUSUM algorithm. We then explore the
last-come-first-served (LCFS) queuing discipline at the sensor transmit queue
to lower detection delay in the non-asymptotic case. Next, we consider the case
of multiple sensors, each with its own wireless transmitter queue, and show
that our analysis extends to the case of multiple homogeneous sensors. When the
sensors are heterogeneous, we present a sensor scheduling algorithm that
minimizes detection delay by balancing the trade-off between the age of the
observations and their information content. Numerical analysis demonstrate
trade-offs that can be used to optimize system design parameters in the
non-asymptotic regime.

Abstract: Estimating subsurface dielectric properties is essential for applications
ranging from environmental surveys of soils to nondestructive evaluation of
concrete in infrastructure. Conventional wave inversion methods typically
assume few discrete homogeneous layers and require dense measurements or strong
prior knowledge of material boundaries, limiting scalability and accuracy in
realistic settings where properties vary continuously. We present a physics
informed machine learning framework that reconstructs subsurface permittivity
as a fully neural, continuous function of depth, trained to satisfy both
measurement data and Maxwells equations. We validate the framework with both
simulations and custom built radar experiments on multilayered natural
materials. Results show close agreement with in-situ permittivity measurements
(R^2=0.93), with sensitivity to even subtle variations (Delta eps_r=2).
Parametric analysis reveals that accurate profiles can be recovered with as few
as three strategically placed sensors in two layer systems. This approach
reframes subsurface inversion from boundary-driven to continuous property
estimation, enabling accurate characterization of smooth permittivity
variations and advancing electromagnetic imaging using low cost radar systems.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In
the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ
particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the
hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle
filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of
the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based
optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle
filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several
recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering
differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such
differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular
PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible
to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison
between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several
existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several
common challenges with state space modelling.

Method: 结合直接序列扩频技术和Grassmannian信号设计非相干通信系统，利用Grassmannian星座的噪声分布特性提高隐蔽性，避免使用导频进行信道估计。

Conclusion: 非相干Grassmannian信号在低检测概率通信中具有实用性和安全性优势，因其改进的隐蔽性和性能表现。

Abstract: This paper proposes a noncoherent low probability of detection (LPD)
communication system based on direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and
Grassmannian signaling. Grassmannian constellations enhance covertness because
they tend to follow a noise-like distribution. Simulations showed that
Grassmannian signaling provides competitive bit error rates (BER) at low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes with low probability of detection at the
unintended receiver compared to coherent schemes that use QPSK or QAM
modulation formats and need pilots to perform channel estimation. The results
suggest the practicality and security benefits of noncoherent Grassmannian
signaling for LPD communications due to their improved covertness and
performance.
