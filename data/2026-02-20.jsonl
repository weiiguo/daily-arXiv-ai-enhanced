Based on a verification algorithm involving target and draft model probabilities, a prefix of the candidate sequence is accepted, and an additional correction token is sampled from a residual distribution to ensure that the final output adheres to the target distribution. While standard speculative decoding uses a verification algorithm which is independent at each token on the path, a recent extension called block verification uses a joint condition involving all sampled on-path probabilities. Block verification (BV) was shown to be optimal over all verification algorithms which use only on-path probabilities, improving on standard speculative decoding. In this work, we first show that block verification is optimal even over verification algorithms that use off-path probabilities, by constructing an information-agnostic linear program (LP). Further, we can extend our LP to the setting where the draft model samples multiple candidate paths, and use it to construct a natural class of multi-path block verification generalizations. While computing the optimal algorithm in this class is not tractable, by considering a stricter class of greedy algorithms, we can formulate an efficient method called greedy multi-path block verification (GBV). Empirically, GBV can improve block efficiency by over 30% and reduce decoding walltimes by over 15% relative to BV. On Llama-3 70B, GBV can improve the end-to-end decoding throughput over SOTA multi-path verification methods by more than 15%."}

However, the limited network resources and unpredictable wireless propagation environments are key design bottlenecks of AR-enabled Metaverse systems. Therefore, this paper presents a resource management framework for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted AR-enabled Metaverse, where the STAR-RIS is configured to improve the communication efficiency between AR users and the Metaverse server located at the base station (BS). Moreover, we formulate a service latency minimization problem via jointly optimizing the computation resource allocation of the BS, coefficient matrix of the STAR-RIS, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmit power of the AR users. To tackle the non-convex problem, we utilize an approximate method to transform it to a tractable form, and decouple the multi-dimensional variables via the alternating optimization method. Particularly, the optimal coefficient matrix is obtained by a penalty function-based method with proved convergence, the CPU frequencies of AR users are derived as the closed-form solution, and the transmit power of AR users and computation resource allocation of the BS are obtained by the Lagrange duality method and convex optimization theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrates that the proposed method achieves remarkable latency reduction than several benchmark methods."}

A damaged transmitter plant emits (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, which propagate through a time-varying diffusion-advection channel and undergo multiplicative loss at the receiver. The sink plant is modeled with a biochemical receiver network that converts the received GLVs into the defensive metabolite (Z)-3-hexenyl $β$-vicianoside, and an alarm decision is defined based on its concentration level. Numerical results show that (Z)-3-hexenol is the primary driver of the system and that plant perception generally operates in a non-linear region.

This work investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of amplitude scintillation at D2C frequencies by scaling L-band scintillation observations from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers to bands relevant to D2C operation, including the low-band, and 3GPP's N255 and N256. These observations are then compared to scaled radio-occultation scintillation observations from the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 (F7/C2) mission, which can be used in regions that do not possess ground-based scintillation monitoring stations. As a proof of concept, five years of ground-based GNSS scintillation data from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, together with two years of F7/C2 observations over the same region, corresponding to the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 25, are analyzed. Both space-based and ground-based observations indicate a pronounced diurnal scintillation peak between 20--22 local time, particularly during the equinoxes, with occurrence rates increasing with solar activity. Ground-based observations also reveal a strong azimuth dependence, with most scintillation events occurring on southward satellite links. The scintillation occurrence rate at the low-band is more than twice that observed at N255 and N256, highlighting the increased robustness of higher D2C bands to ionospheric scintillation. These results demonstrate how GNSS scintillation observations can be leveraged to characterize and anticipate scintillation-induced D2C link impairments, which help in D2C system design and the implementation of scintillation mitigation strategies."}

Unlike idealized models, the reflecting elements (REs) of the RIS are assumed to possess inherent electrical resistance, introducing a practical non-ideal effect often neglected in prior research. The aim of the study is to maximize the secrecy rate of the MIMO system under perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). To achieve this, the secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a low-complexity joint optimization framework based on an adaptive projected gradient method (PGM), which simultaneously updates both the transmit precoding matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Solving the exact problem is computationally complex. Thus, a simplified variant is further introduced that maximizes the channel power difference rather than the exact secrecy rate. The simulation results show that this approximation yields a secrecy rate close to the true optimum while significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, the proposed PGM with an adaptive step size initialization and control mechanism substantially improves the secrecy rate and reduces the computational time compared to the conventional fixed step size PGM. Overall, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PGM and demonstrate that adopting a practical RIS model is essential for establishing secure RIS-assisted MIMO communication links, especially under varying RE resistance values."}

In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation."}

Virtual aperture processing requires precise knowledge of the device trajectory, which in this scenario is opportunistic and unknown. One can exploit onboard inertial sensors to estimate the device trajectory; however, the inertial sensors accuracy is not sufficient. To address this, we develop an autofocus algorithm based on extended Kalman filtering that jointly tracks the trajectory and compensates residual errors using phase observations from strong scatterers. The Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound for localization is derived under correlated inertial errors. Numerical results at 28GHz demonstrate centimeter-level accuracy with realistic sensor parameters."}
