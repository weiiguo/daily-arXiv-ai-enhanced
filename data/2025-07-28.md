### [1] [RIS Codebook Index Assignment under Imperfect Control Links Using TSP-Inspired Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18727)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) promise transformative gains in
wireless communications by enabling programmable control of the propagation
environment through discrete phase configurations. In practical deployments,
the control of RIS phase states is typically managed using finite codebooks,
with configuration indices transmitted over low latency, yet imperfect,
wireless feedback channels. Even rare feedback bit errors can lead to
significant mismatches between intended and applied RIS states, degrading
system performance. This paper addresses the challenge of robust RIS codebook
index assignment by formulating it as a combinatorial optimization problem,
equivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where codewords are
"cities" and edge weights reflect SNR degradation under codeword confusion. A
novel three-phase heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve this, consisting of
a provision phase, a shotgun phase, and a fuzzy concatenation phase. Simulation
results show that the method outperforms conventional indexing strategies and
achieves near-optimal robustness to index errors, while also being scalable and
hardwareagnostic for real time deployment. Future work includes multiple bits
error correction and online adaptive mapping for time varying channels.

### [2] [EDPC: Accelerating Lossless Compression via Lightweight Probability Models and Decoupled Parallel Dataflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18969)
*Zeyi Lu,Xiaoxiao Ma,Yujun Huang,Minxiao Chen,Bin Chen,Baoyi An,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的双路径并行压缩框架（EDPC），通过分层优化解决了现有自回归压缩模型在压缩比和实时处理上的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多源多媒体数据的爆炸式增长对传输和存储需求激增，现有自回归压缩模型因特征提取不足和资源消耗高而受限。

Method: EDPC框架结合信息流细化（IFR）和多路径字节细化块（MBRB）优化建模能力，并通过潜在转换引擎（LTE）和解耦管道压缩架构（DPCA）提升执行效率。

Result: 实验表明，EDPC压缩速度提升2.7倍，压缩比提高3.2%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EDPC为带宽受限场景下的大规模多媒体数据实时处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The explosive growth of multi-source multimedia data has significantly
increased the demands for transmission and storage, placing substantial
pressure on bandwidth and storage infrastructures. While Autoregressive
Compression Models (ACMs) have markedly improved compression efficiency through
probabilistic prediction, current approaches remain constrained by two critical
limitations: suboptimal compression ratios due to insufficient fine-grained
feature extraction during probability modeling, and real-time processing
bottlenecks caused by high resource consumption and low compression speeds. To
address these challenges, we propose Efficient Dual-path Parallel Compression
(EDPC), a hierarchically optimized compression framework that synergistically
enhances modeling capability and execution efficiency via coordinated dual-path
operations. At the modeling level, we introduce the Information Flow Refinement
(IFR) metric grounded in mutual information theory, and design a Multi-path
Byte Refinement Block (MBRB) to strengthen cross-byte dependency modeling via
heterogeneous feature propagation. At the system level, we develop a Latent
Transformation Engine (LTE) for compact high-dimensional feature representation
and a Decoupled Pipeline Compression Architecture (DPCA) to eliminate
encoding-decoding latency through pipelined parallelization. Experimental
results demonstrate that EDPC achieves comprehensive improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, including a 2.7x faster compression speed, and a 3.2%
higher compression ratio. These advancements establish EDPC as an efficient
solution for real-time processing of large-scale multimedia data in
bandwidth-constrained scenarios. Our code is available at

### [3] [Dynamic Agile Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Antenna (DARISA) MIMO: DoF Analysis and Effective DoF Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19136)
*Jiale Bai,Hui-Ming Wang,Liang Jin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态可重构智能表面天线（DARISA）阵列，集成到MIMO收发器中，通过快速相位调整策略（DAAPR）提升系统自由度（DoF）和有效自由度（EDoF）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MIMO系统中动态相位调整的需求，以提升系统自由度和信道容量。

Method: 采用并行馈电网络激活超表面单元，结合DAAPR策略，并利用FP和SDR算法优化相位响应。

Result: 理论分析显示，DAAPR策略在接收DARISA少于发射DARISA时能显著提升DoF；仿真验证了EDoF随调整频率、单元密度和相位量化精度增加而提升。

Conclusion: DARISA MIMO系统通过动态相位调整策略和优化算法，显著提升了系统性能，为未来通信系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamic agile reconfigurable intelligent surface
antenna (DARISA) array integrated into multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
transceivers. Each DARISA comprises a number of metasurface elements activated
simultaneously via a parallel feed network. The proposed system enables rapid
and intelligent phase response adjustments for each metasurface element within
a single symbol duration, facilitating a dynamic agile adjustment of phase
response (DAAPR) strategy. By analyzing the theoretical degrees of freedom
(DoF) of the DARISA MIMO system under the DAAPR framework, we derive an
explicit relationship between DoF and critical system parameters, including
agility frequentness (i.e., the number of phase adjustments of metasurface
elements during one symbol period), cluster angular spread of wireless
channels, DARISA array size, and the number of transmit/receive DARISAs. The
DoF result reveals a significant conclusion: when the number of receive DARISAs
is smaller than that of transmit DARISAs, the DAAPR strategy of the DARISA MIMO
enhances the overall system DoF. Furthermore, relying on DoF alone to measure
channel capacity is insufficient, so we analyze the effective DoF (EDoF) that
reflects the impacts of the DoF and channel matrix singular value distribution
on capacity. We show channel capacity monotonically increases with EDoF, and
optimize the agile phase responses of metasurface elements by using fractional
programming (FP) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithms to maximize the
EDoF. Simulations validate the theoretical DoF gains and reveal that increasing
agility frequentness, metasurface element density, and phase quantization
accuracy can enhance the EDoF. Additionally, densely deployed elements can
compensate for the loss in communication performance caused by lower phase
quantization accuracy.

### [4] [Achievable Rates for a Distributed Antenna System with No Channel State Information at the Central Processor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19177)
*Yi Song,Hao Xu,Kai Wan,Kai-Kit Wong,Giuseppe Caire,Shlomo Shamai*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了无线通信中分散式架构的上行链路性能，特别是在信道状态随机且需要通过导频符号估计的情况下，探讨了单用户和两个中继组成的钻石网络的遍历可达速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中，信道状态是随机过程，需要通过导频符号估计，而导频符号可能占用大量信道相干块资源，尤其是在前传容量有限时，导频和数据符号的传输会带来显著开销。

Method: 采用信息论方法，分析了高斯信道下由单用户和两个中继组成的钻石网络，假设信道状态在中继端已知但在中央处理器端未知。

Result: 推导了该网络的遍历可达速率，揭示了导频符号传输对系统性能的影响。

Conclusion: 论文为分散式架构无线通信系统的设计提供了理论支持，特别是在信道状态估计和资源分配方面具有指导意义。

Abstract: A recent trend in wireless communications considers the migration of
traditional monolithic base stations to the so-called disaggregated
architecture, where radio units (RUs) implement only the low-level physical
layer functionalities such as demodulation, and A/D conversion, while the
high-level physical layer, such as channel decoding, is implemented as
software-defined functions running on general-purpose hardware in some remote
central processing unit (CP). The corresponding information theoretic model for
the uplink (from the wireless users to the CP) is a multiaccess-relay channel
with primitive oblivious relays. The relays (RUs) are oblivious, as they are
agnostic of the users codebooks, and primitive, since the fronthaul links (from
RUs to CP) are error-free with limited capacity. This class of networks has
been intensely studied in the information theoretic literature, where several
approximated or exact (under certain conditions) capacity results have been
derived. In particular, in the Gaussian case, the model has been analyzed for
fixed and known channel state. This paper is motivated by the fact that, in
practice, the channel state is a random process, and it is estimated at the
base station side through uplink pilot symbols sent by the users. The pilot
dimension may take up a large portion of the channel coherence block, i.e., the
number of symbols over which the channel state remains approximately constant.
Hence, sending both pilot and data symbols from the relays to the CP may
require a significant overhead, especially when the fronthaul capacity is
small. As a prototypical problem, we consider the ergodic achievable rate for a
diamond network formed by a single user and two relays where the channel state
is known at the relays, but not known at the CP.

### [5] [Overview of 3GPP Release 19 Study on Channel Modeling Enhancements to TR 38.901 for 6G](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19266)
*Hitesh Poddar,Dimitri Gold,Daewon Lee,Nan Zhang,Gokul Sridharan,Henrik Asplund,Mansoor Shaf*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文讨论了3GPP Rel 19对7-24 GHz频段信道模型的标准化研究，填补了6G技术中的关键空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信系统的发展需要准确且标准化的信道模型，尤其是针对7-24 GHz频段，这是6G的潜在候选频段。

Method: 通过3GPP Rel 19研究，改进了信道模型，包括郊区宏小区场景建模、用户终端天线模型、簇和射线数量可变性等。

Result: 研究增强了信道模型的准确性，支持了未来6G部署中的关键需求，如近场传播和空间非平稳效应。

Conclusion: 3GPP Rel 19的信道模型研究为6G技术提供了重要的标准化支持，填补了现有模型的不足。

Abstract: Channel models are a fundamental component of wireless communication systems,
providing critical insights into the physics of radio wave propagation. As
wireless systems evolve every decade, the development of accurate and
standardized channel models becomes increasingly important for the development,
evaluation and performance assessment of emerging technologies. An effort to
develop a standardized channel model began around 2000 through the Third
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) with the aim of addressing a broad range of frequencies from sub-1
GHz to 100 GHz. Prior efforts focused heavily on sub-6 GHz bands and mmWave
bands, and there exist some gaps in accurately modeling the 7-24 GHz frequency
range, a promising candidate band for 6G. To address these gaps, 3GPP approved
a Release (Rel) 19 channel modeling study. This study resulted in several
enhancements to the channel models, including the ability to accurately model a
Suburban Macrocell (SMa) scenario, realistic User Terminal (UT) antenna models,
variability in the number of clusters, variability in the number of rays per
cluster, a framework for capturing variability in power among all
polarizations, near field (NF) propagation, and spatial non-stationarity (SNS)
effects, all of which may be crucial for future 6G deployments. This paper
presents the outcomes of this study and provides an overview of the underlying
rationale, and key discussions that guided the validation, refinement, and
enhancements of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel models.

### [6] [Sparse Recovery from Group Orbits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19274)
*Timm Gilles,Hartmut Führ*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于有限群表示的随机轨道生成的结构化测量框架，用于稀疏恢复，分析了固定和随机采样集两种情况下的测量数量估计，并探讨了不同表示对恢复效果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏恢复方法通常忽略测量方案中的结构，而实际问题中结构显著，因此需要一种能够利用这种结构的框架。

Method: 通过有限群表示的随机轨道生成结构化测量，分别研究固定和随机采样集的情况，推导确保受限等距性的测量数量估计。

Result: 结果表明，测量数量取决于具体表示，某些表示（如左正则表示）能提供更好的恢复效果。

Conclusion: 本文不仅为群结构测量的稀疏恢复建立了框架，还推广了现有测量方案（如部分随机循环矩阵）。

Abstract: While most existing sparse recovery results allow only minimal structure
within the measurement scheme, many practical problems possess significant
structure. To address this gap, we present a framework for structured
measurements that are generated by random orbits of a group representation
associated with a finite group. We differentiate between two scenarios: one in
which the sampling set is fixed and another in which the sampling set is
randomized. For each case, we derive an estimate for the number of measurements
required to ensure that the restricted isometry property holds with high
probability. These estimates are contingent upon the specific representation
employed. For this reason, we analyze and characterize various representations
that yield favorable recovery outcomes, including the left regular
representation. Our work not only establishes a comprehensive framework for
sparse recovery of group-structured measurements but also generalizes
established measurement schemes, such as those derived from partial random
circulant matrices.

### [7] [Low-Complexity 6DMA Rotation and Position Optimization Based on Statistical Channel Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19309)
*Qijun Jiang,Xiaodan Shao,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的6DMA优化方法，通过顺序优化旋转和位置，显著降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了与交替优化相当的通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6DMA技术能够通过灵活调整天线的位置和旋转来充分利用无线信道的空间变化，但现有方法计算复杂度高，需要更高效的优化方案。

Method: 提出了一种顺序优化方法，先确定最佳旋转，再在约束条件下找到可实现这些旋转的位置，避免了交替优化的高计算复杂度。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法显著降低了计算复杂度，同时通信性能与交替优化相当，优于固定位置/旋转的天线阵列。

Conclusion: 顺序优化方法为6DMA设计提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: The six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a promising technology to fully
exploit spatial variation in wireless channels by allowing flexible adjustment
of three-dimensional (3D) positions and rotations of antennas at the
transceiver. In this paper, we consider a 6DMA-equipped base station (BS) and
aim to maximize the average sum logarithmic rate of all users served by the BS
by jointly designing 6DMA surface positions and rotations based on statistical
channel information (SCI). Different from prior works on 6DMA design which use
alternating optimization to iteratively update surface positions and rotations,
we propose a new sequential optimization method that first determines the
optimal rotations and then identifies feasible positions to realize these
rotations under practical antenna placement constraints. Simulation results
show that our proposed optimization scheme significantly reduces the
computational complexity of conventional alternating optimization (AO), while
achieving communication performance comparable to the AO-based approach and
superior to existing fixed-position/rotation antenna arrays.

### [8] [On Anti-collusion Codes for Averaging Attack in Multimedia Fingerprinting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19384)
*Jing Jiang,Cailin Wen,Minquan Cheng*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的多媒体指纹追踪算法，并引入了二进制强可识别父属性码（SMIPPC）及其级联码，以提高抗平均攻击的指纹码率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指纹码因强组合结构导致码率低，无法高效追踪所有共谋者，需改进追踪算法和码结构。

Method: 提出新型追踪算法，并引入二进制强可识别父属性码（SMIPPC）及其级联码，以降低组合结构强度。

Result: SMIPPC码率高于现有码，且新型追踪算法具有更强的追踪能力。

Conclusion: SMIPPC及其追踪算法显著提升了多媒体指纹的抗共谋攻击能力，但需注意其部分追踪限制和级联码的非SMIPPC性质。

Abstract: Multimedia fingerprinting is a technique to protect the copyrighted contents
against being illegally redistributed under various collusion attack models.
Averaging attack is the most fair choice for each colluder to avoid detection,
and also makes the pirate copy have better perceptional quality. This makes
such an attack one of the most feasible approaches to carrying out collusion.
In order to trace all the colluders, several types of multimedia fingerprinting
codes were introduced to construct fingerprints resistant to averaging attacks
on multimedia contents, such as AND anti-collusion codes (AND-ACCs), binary
separable codes (SCs), logical anti-collusion codes (LACCs), binary frameproof
codes (FPCs), binary strongly-separable codes (SSCs) and binary secure code
with list decoding (SCLDs). Then codes with the rate as high as possible are
desired. However, the existing fingerprinting codes have low code rate due to
the strong combinatorial structure. The reason is that the previous research
methods adopted simple tracing algorithms. In this paper, we first propose
novel tracing algorithms and then find appropriate fingerprinting codes with
weaker combinatorial structure, i.e., the binary strongly identifiable parent
property code for multimedia fingerprinting (SMIPPC) and its concatenated code.
Theoretical comparisons and numerical comparisons show that SMIPPCs have higher
code rates than those of the existing codes due to their weaker combinatorial
structures. It is worth noting that SMIPPCs can only trace a part of colluders
by using the previous tracing algorithm and the concatenated SMIPPC may be not
an SMIPPC. This implies that our tracing algorithms have strong traceability.

Conclusion: 样本丰富性现象为信号处理提供了简化和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper reports, by way of introduction, on the advances made by our group
and the broader signal processing community on the concept of sample abundance;
a phenomenon that naturally arises in one-bit and few-bit signal processing
frameworks. By leveraging large volumes of low-precision measurements, we show
how traditionally costly constraints, such as matrix semi-definiteness and rank
conditions, become redundant, yielding simple overdetermined linear feasibility
problems. We illustrate key algorithms, theoretical guarantees via the Finite
Volume Property, and the sample abundance singularity phenomenon, where
computational complexity sharply drops.

### [10] [Design and Implementation of Parametrized Look-Up Tables for Post-Correction of Oversampling Low-Resolution ADCs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18673)
*Morriel Kasher,Michael Tinston,Predrag Spasojevic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于设计、优化和实现查找表（LUT）的框架，用于恢复噪声、过采样、量化信号，通过全数字解决方案模拟预量化抖动效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决量化信号恢复中的频谱纯度问题，提出一种无需训练的模型驱动方法。

Method: 将LUT设计问题分解为四个阶段，采用两种新颖的索引方案压缩LUT大小，并研究了三种抖动方法。

Result: 在3位量化信号中，SFDR提高了19 dBc，LUT大小压缩了四个数量级，仅需324字节内存。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低分辨率宽带设备，具有超低延迟优势。

Abstract: We propose a framework for the design, optimization, and implementation of
Look-Up Tables (LUTs) used to recover noisy, oversampled, quantized signals
given a parametric input model. The LUTs emulate the spectral effects of
pre-quantization dithering through an all-digital solution applied after
quantization. This methodology decomposes the intractable LUT design problem
into four distinct stages, each of which is addressed analytically using a
model-driven approach without reliance on training. Three dithering methods are
studied to improve spectral purity metrics. Two novel indexing schemes are
proposed to limit the LUT memory overhead shown to compress the LUT size by
over four orders of magnitude with marginal performance loss. The LUT design is
tested with an oversampled noisy sinusoidal input quantized to 3 bits and shown
to improve its Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) by over 19 dBc with only 324
bytes of memory while maintaining the same 3-bit fixed-point precision at the
digital output. This correction can be implemented using two-level
combinational logic ensuring ultra-low latency and, hence, suitable for
low-resolution wideband devices.

Result: 数值结果表明，所提系统在吞吐量上显著优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化天线位置和通信参数，可移动天线技术能有效提升NOMA网络的性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the movable antenna (MA)- assisted downlink
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network to maximize system throughput. In
the considered scenario, both the base station (BS) and users are equipped with
MA, and a predetermined successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding
order is adopted. Based on the field-response channel model, we formulate a
complex, non-convex problem to jointly optimize the BS beamforming, power
allocation, and MA positions at both the transmitter and receivers. To address
this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization
(AO) framework, which decomposes the original problem into three distinct
subproblems. By employing sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) and
successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, the non-convex constraints
within each subproblem are transformed into tractable. This methodology ensures
the algorithm converges to a stable, locally optimal solution. Numerical
results validate that the proposed system, which fully exploits the degrees of
freedom from antenna mobility at both ends, significantly outperforms
benchmarks in terms of throughput.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种新型透射式可重构智能表面（RIS）收发器架构支持的多组多播下行通信系统，提出了三种算法以解决最大最小速率问题，并验证了其收敛性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究透射式RIS在多组多播通信中的应用，以最大化用户的最小速率，同时解决现有方法的高计算复杂度和性能妥协问题。

Method: 1. 使用逐次凸逼近（SCA）和惩罚函数法的迭代解法；2. 基于加权最小均方误差（WMMSE）框架的二阶锥规划（SOCP）方法；3. 结合平滑逼近理论和最大化-最小化（MM）方法的低复杂度无求解器算法。

Result: 数值结果表明，SOCP方法在最小速率和计算复杂度上优于惩罚算法，而低复杂度设计在性能略有下降的情况下显著降低了复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出的三种算法均有效，其中SOCP方法性能最优，低复杂度设计适合对计算资源有限的应用。

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS) transceiver architectureenabled multigroup multicast downlink
communication system. Under this setup, an optimization problem is formulated
to maximize the minimum rate of users across all groups, subject to the maximum
available power of each RIS unit. Due to the nondifferentiable nature of the
objective function, the max-min rate problem is challenging to solve. To tackle
this difficult problem, we develop an iterative solution by leveraging the
successive convex approximation (SCA) and the penalty function method. However,
the above approach has high computational complexity and may lead to
compromised performance. To overcome these drawbacks, we design an efficient
second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based method using the weighted minimum
mean squared error (WMMSE) framework to reduce computational complexity.
Furthermore, to further reduce the computational complexity, we also propose a
low-complexity and solver-free algorithm that analytically updates all
variables by combining the smooth approximation theory and the
majorization-minimization (MM) method. Numerical results are provided to verify
the convergence and effectiveness of our proposed three algorithms. It is also
demonstrated that the SOCP-based method outperforms the penalty-based algorithm
in terms of both the achieved min rate and the computational complexity. In
contrast, the lowcomplexity design achieves significantly lower complexity with
only slightly degraded performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a high-altitude platform station (HAPS)-enabled
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system designed for
sixth-generation (6G) networks. Positioned in the stratosphere, HAPS serves as
a super-macro base station, leveraging advanced beamforming techniques to
enable communication and sensing simultaneously. This research addresses the
need for equitable service distribution in 6G networks by focusing on fairness
within the HAPS-ISAC system. It tackles a non-convex optimization problem that
balances sensing beampattern gain and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) requirements among communication users (CUs) using a max-min fairness
approach while adhering to power constraints. The proposed HAPS-ISAC framework
ensures efficient resource allocation, reliable coverage, and improved sensing
accuracy. Simulation results validate the potential of HAPS-ISAC as a pivotal
enabler for 6G networks and integrated communication-sensing systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel doubly-dispersive (DD) multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) channel model incorporating flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs),
which is suitable for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in
high-mobility scenarios. We then discuss how the proposed FIM-parameterized DD
(FPDD) channel model can be applied in a logical manner to ISAC waveforms that
are known to perform well in DD environments, namely, orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and
affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Leveraging the proposed model,
we formulate an achievable rate maximization problem with a strong sensing
constraint for all the aforementioned waveforms, which we then solve via a
gradient ascent algorithm with closed-form gradients presented as a bonus. Our
numerical results indicate that the achievable rate is significantly impacted
by the emerging FIM technology with careful parametrization essential in
obtaining strong ISAC performance across all waveforms suitable to mitigating
the effects of DD channels.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising
technology to enhance indoor wireless communication and sensing performance.
However, the construction of reliable received signal strength (RSS)-based
fingerprint databases for RIS-assisted indoor positioning remains an open
challenge due to the lack of realistic and spatially consistent channel
modeling methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method with open-source
codes for generating RIS-assisted RSS fingerprint databases. Our method
captures the complex RIS-assisted multipath behaviors by extended cluster-based
channel modeling and the physical and electromagnetic properties of RIS and
transmitter (Tx). And the spatial consistency is incorporated when simulating
the fingerprint data collection across neighboring positions. Furthermore, the
proposed method offers exceptional flexibility in configuring RIS and Tx
parameters. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the fingerprint
database generated by the proposed method. Moreover, the positioning
performance on the database using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and deep neural
network (DNN) is analyzed, providing valuable insights for the system design.

TL;DR: 研究评估了一种低成本便携式平衡垫（BM）的可靠性和有效性，通过机器人实验和人体实验验证其作为力板（FP）替代方案的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 力板（FP）在实验室条件下是评估姿势摇摆的金标准，但其便携性差且需要专业知识，限制了广泛应用。本研究旨在验证BM的可靠性和有效性。

Method: 研究分为两部分：机器人实验使用UR10机械臂生成受控摇摆模式评估BM的可靠性和敏感性；人体实验让51名健康年轻人在BM和FP上完成平衡任务，比较摇摆指标。

Result: 机器人实验显示BM在单腿和双腿站立中具有良好到优秀的可靠性（ICC>0.75）。人体实验显示BM与FP在摇摆路径和范围上中度到强相关，但BM会高估摇摆指标，校准后一致性提高。

Conclusion: BM在多种站立条件下表现出稳定的摇摆测量能力，校准后具有可靠性和有效性，可作为FP的便携替代方案。

Abstract: Postural sway assessment is important for detecting balance problems and
identifying people at risk of falls. Force plates (FP) are considered the gold
standard postural sway assessment method in laboratory conditions, but their
lack of portability and requirement of high-level expertise limit their
widespread usage. This study evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel
Balance Mat (BM) device, a low-cost portable alternative that uses optical
fibre technology. The research includes two studies: a robot study and a human
study. In the robot study, a UR10 robotic arm was used to obtain controlled
sway patterns to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the BM. In the human
study, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in
combination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway
mean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range,
and sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability
was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values
greater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were
considered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent
ICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed
moderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman
plots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the
FP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP. Calibration was
used to improve the agreement between the devices. The device demonstrated
consistent sway measurement across varied stance conditions, establishing both
reliability and validity following appropriate calibration.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种随机ADMM算法，用于解决大规模最大-最小波束成形问题，显著降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性优化方法在问题规模增大时计算效率低下，需要更高效的算法。

Method: 将可行性检查问题转化为线性约束优化问题，并开发随机ADMM算法，每次迭代仅需解决少量子问题。

Result: 算法具有O(1/\bar{t})收敛速度，数值结果显示其复杂度显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 随机ADMM算法为大规模MMB问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of max-min beamforming (MMB) for cell-free massive
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, where the objective is to maximize the
minimum achievable rate among all users. Existing MMB methods are mainly based
on deterministic optimization methods, which are computationally inefficient
when the problem size grows large. To address this issue, we, in this paper,
propose a randomized alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM)
algorithm for large-scale MMB problems. We first propose a novel formulation
that transforms the highly challenging feasibility-checking problem into a
linearly constrained optimization problem. An efficient randomized ADMM is then
developed for solving the linearly constrained problem. Unlike standard ADMM,
randomized ADMM only needs to solve a small number of subproblems at each
iteration to ensure convergence, thus achieving a substantial complexity
reduction. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm
exhibits an O(1/\bar{t}) convergence rate (\bar{t} represents the number of
iterations), which is on the same order as its deterministic counterpart.
Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm offers a significant
complexity advantage over existing methods in solving the MMB problem.

Conclusion: 通过调整MLP参数，可以在推理精度和训练时间之间取得平衡，优化模型性能以满足实时需求。

Abstract: An innovative method for radio map estimation in optical wireless
communications is proposed that is based on Machine Learning rather than
simulation techniques. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) representation of indoor
Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems is suggested, and signal propagation
is estimated. The simulation and performance predictions are accurate, fast and
require a reduced set of training sample size with respect to other
counterparts, making this solution very suitable for real time estimation of an
indoor VLC system. It is shown that by tweaking MLP parameters, such as sample
size, number of epochs and batch size, one can balance the desired level of
inference accuracy with training time and optimize the model's performance to
meet real-time requirements.

Abstract: The design of accurate Digital Twins (DTs) of electromagnetic environments
strictly depends on the fidelity of the underlying environmental modeling.
Evaluating the differences among diverse levels of modeling accuracy is key to
determine the relevance of the model features towards both efficient and
accurate DT simulations. In this paper, we propose two metrics, the Hausdorff
ray tracing (HRT) and chamfer ray tracing (CRT) distances, to consistently
compare the temporal, angular and power features between two ray tracing
simulations performed on 3D scenarios featured by environmental changes. To
evaluate the introduced metrics, we considered a high-fidelity digital twin
model of an area of Milan, Italy and we enriched it with two different types of
environmental changes: (i) the inclusion of parked vehicles meshes, and (ii)
the segmentation of the buildings facade faces to separate the windows mesh
components from the rest of the building. We performed grid-based and vehicular
ray tracing simulations at 28 GHz carrier frequency on the obtained scenarios
integrating the NVIDIA Sionna RT ray tracing simulator with the SUMO vehicular
traffic simulator. Both the HRT and CRT metrics highlighted the areas of the
scenarios where the simulated radio propagation features differ owing to the
introduced mesh integrations, while the vehicular ray tracing simulations
allowed to uncover the distance patterns arising along realistic vehicular
trajectories.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for discrete multiresolution analysis of graph
signals. The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined
in the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to
the analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining
samplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of
patches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets,
and eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures
orthogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to
properly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar
wavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can
efficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a
definition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction.
We support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs
whose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation,
we combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful
patches, with landmark \texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional
embeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness,
scalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable
approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet
approaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.

Abstract: This work presents two complementary real-time rail vehicle localization
methods based on magnetic field measurements and a pre-recorded magnetic map.
The first uses a particle filter reweighted via magnetic similarity, employing
a heavy-tailed non-Gaussian kernel for enhanced stability. The second is a
stateless sequence alignment technique that transforms real-time magnetic
signals into the spatial domain and matches them to the map using a similarity
measure. Experiments with operational train data show that the particle filter
achieves track-selective, sub-5-meter accuracy over 21.6 km, though its
performance degrades at low speeds and during cold starts. Accuracy tests were
constrained by the GNSS-based reference system. In contrast, the
alignment-based method excels in cold-start scenarios, localizing within 30 m
in 92 % of tests (100 % using top-3 matches). A hybrid approach combines both
methods$\unicode{x2014}$alignment-based initialization followed by particle
filter tracking. Runtime analysis confirms real-time capability on
consumer-grade hardware. The system delivers accurate, robust localization
suitable for safety-critical rail applications.
