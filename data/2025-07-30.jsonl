One significant change is that agents,\ninstead of traditional machines or humans, will be the primary participants in\nthe future production process, which consequently requires a novel AI-native\ncommunication system tailored for agent communications. Integrating the ability\nof large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a\npotential approach.

In\nthis paper, we innovatively propose a task-oriented agent communication system.\nSpecifically, we leverage the original LLM to learn a specialized machine\nlanguage represented by token embeddings.

Notably, as a natural generalization of\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward\ncompatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also\noffering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable\nphysical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all,\nthis article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a\ncandidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise\nintroduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM,\nfollowed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion\nof its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and\nrepresentative requirements."}

Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of\nGaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver\ninformation symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the\ntarget's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by\nprocessing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the\nsequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the\ninformation signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of\nthe information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive\nthe corresponding Cram\\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose\npractical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we\nformulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to\nminimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS.\nWhen the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting\nbeamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an\noptimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic\nsensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a\nlocally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex\napproximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing\nGaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for\ntarget sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior\nISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes."}

In particular, the RIS operates in the NF of both the legitimate user\nand the passive adversary, enhancing the legitimate users received signal while\nsuppressing the adversarys detection capability. Whereas, the base station (BS)\napplies RSMA to increase the covert communication rate composed of a private\nand a shared rate component. To characterize system covertness, we derive\nclosed form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP), outage\nprobability (OP), and optimal detection threshold for the adversary. We\nformulate a non-convex joint beamforming optimization problem at the BS and RIS\nunder unit-modulus constraints to maximize the covert rate. To tackle this, we\npropose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where the BS beamformer is\ndesigned using a two-stage iterative method based on successive convex\napproximation (SCA). Additionally, two low-complexity techniques are introduced\nto further reduce the adversarys received power.

Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient\nmeasurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents\nsite-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray\ntracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a\nlocation calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by\noptimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and\nmeasured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for\nline-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.\nValidation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss\nprediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT\nunderestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions\nremain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and\nprovides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment."}

The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces\nsignificant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for\nactivity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we\npropose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method\nfirst employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML)\napproach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data\nportions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid\nVariational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint\ndata detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the\nproposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced\nsensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a\nfinite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated\nposterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing\n(MP) algorithm from diverging.
