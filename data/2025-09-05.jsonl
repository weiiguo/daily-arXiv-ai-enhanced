A frequently overlooked but critical factor is the agent\nitself, e.g., the user carrying the device, which potentially obstructs\nline-of-sight (LOS) links to the base stations (anchors). This paper addresses\nthe problem of accurate positioning in scenarios where LOS links are partially\nblocked by the agent. The agent is modeled as an extended object (EO) that\nscatters, attenuates, and blocks radio signals. We propose a Bayesian method\nthat fuses ``active'' measurements (between device and anchors) with\n``passive'' multistatic radar-type measurements (between anchors, reflected by\nthe EO). To handle measurement origin uncertainty, we introduce an multi-sensor\nand multiple-measurement probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm that\njointly fuses all EO-related measurements. Furthermore, we develop an EO model\ntailored to agents such as human users, accounting for multiple reflections\nscattered off the body surface, and propose a simplified variant for\nlow-complexity implementation. Evaluation on both synthetic and real radio\nmeasurements demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional\nPDA methods based on point target assumptions, particularly during and after\nobstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) conditions."}

A modal decomposition of\nthe Gram matrix reveals that its structure is dominated by a few modes near the\ntarget frequency, and that each modal contribution reflects the spatial\ncorrelation of the corresponding mode shape. This suggests that placing sensors\nnear nodal regions where spatial correlation is low can reduce coherence in the\nfrequency response function (FRF) matrix and improve force reconstruction\naccuracy. To translate the physical insight into a practical design framework,\na greedy algorithm is proposed to select sensor locations that minimize the\noff-diagonal energy of the Gram matrix.
