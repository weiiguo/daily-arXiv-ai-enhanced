ISAC designs\nfacilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving.\nSuch applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication\n(URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive\ntargets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability\nconstraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of\nURLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station\n(BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is\ndeployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS\nregularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to\nthe UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a\ntarget of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional\nURLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper\ncoding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and\nsensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for\nhandling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive\ninterference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the\nrate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by\nevaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of\nthe URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our\nnumerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly\noutperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes.

Besides, we optimize\nstem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our\ntheoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that\nstem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that\nscales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance,\nscalable, gigantic MIMO."}

Leveraging programmable hardware\narchitectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically\nadapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,\nincluding joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either\ndemonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through\ngradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques\nrooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review\narchitectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured\nstate-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence\nmodels effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we\nexplore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing\nboth theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that\nICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver\nadaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without\nrequiring online retraining."}
