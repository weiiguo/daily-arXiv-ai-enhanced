The network operates in a time-slotted fashion to serve content-requesting users by streaming cached files. The users being unsatisfied by the multicat streaming face a delivery outage, implying that they will remain interested in their preference at the next time-slot, which leads to a forward dynamics on the user preference. To design a latency-optimal streaming policy, the dynamics of latency is properly modeled and included in the learning procedure. We show that this dynamics surprisingly represents a backward dynamics. The combination of problem's forward and backward dynamics then develops a forward-backward Markov decision process (FB-MDP) that fully captures the network evolution across time. This FB-MDP necessitates usage of a forward-backward multi-objective reinforcement learning (FB-MORL) algorithm to optimize the expected latency as well as other performance metrics of interest including the overall outage probability and total resource consumption.

Among NTN platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are especially promising due to their rapid deployability. However, this shift from fixed, wired base stations (BSs) to mobile, wireless, energy-constrained UAV-BSs introduces unique security challenges. Their central role in emergency communications makes them attractive candidates for emergency alert spoofing. Their limited computing and energy resources make them more vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and their dependence on wireless backhaul links and GNSS navigation exposes them to jamming, interception, and spoofing. Furthermore, UAV mobility opens new attack vectors such as malicious handover manipulation.

Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a potential technology of next-generation communications due to its remarkable advantages in spectrum efficiency and user access capability. The integration of PA and NOMA enables synergistic leveraging of PA's channel regulation capability and NOMA's multi-user multiplexing advantage, forming a complementary technical framework to deliver high-performance communication solutions. However, the use of successive interference cancellation (SIC) introduces significant security risks to power-domain NOMA systems when internal eavesdropping is present. To this end, this paper investigates the physical layer security of a PA-aided NOMA system where a nearby user is considered as an internal eavesdropper. We enhance the security of the NOMA system through optimizing the radiated power of PAs and analyze the secrecy performance by deriving the closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP). Furthermore, we extend the characterization of PA flexibility beyond deployment and scale adjustment to include flexible regulation of PA coupling length. Based on two conventional PA power models, i.e., the equal power model and the proportional power model, we propose a flexible power strategy to achieve secure transmission. The results highlight the potential of the PA-aided NOMA system in mitigating internal eavesdropping risks, and provide an effective strategy for optimizing power allocation and cell range of user activity."}

Conventional SAR systems typically leverages a deterministic radar waveform, while it conflicts with the integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigm by discarding signaling randomness, in whole or in part. In fact, this approach reduces to the uplink pilot sensing in 5G New Radio (NR) with sounding reference signals (SRS), underutilizing data symbols. To explore the potential of data-aided imaging, we develop a low-altitude SAR imaging framework that sufficiently leverages data symbols carried by the native orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication waveform. The randomness of modulated data in the temporal-frequency (TF) domain, introduced by non-constant modulus constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), may however severely degrade the imaging quality. To mitigate this effect, we incorporate several TF-domain filtering schemes within a rangeDoppler (RD) imaging framework and evaluate their impact. We further propose using the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of a reference point target's profile as an imaging performance metric. Simulation results with 5G NR parameters demonstrate that data-aided imaging substantially outperforms pilot-only counterpart, accordingly validating the effectiveness of the proposed OFDM-SAR imaging approach in LAWNs."}

Existing statistically-based blind modulation classification methods for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) often fail to achieve the required accuracy and performance. Consequently, the modulation classification research community has shifted its focus toward deep learning techniques, which demonstrate promising performance, but come with increased computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight subcarrier-based modulation classification method for OFDM systems. In the proposed approach, a selected set of subcarriers in an OFDM frame is classified first, followed by the prediction of the modulation types for the remaining subcarriers based on the initial results. A Lightweight Neural Network (LWNN) is employed to identify the initially selected set of subcarriers, and its output is fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as an embedded vector to predict the modulation schemes of the remaining subcarriers in the OFDM frame."}

In parallel, adaptive AP mode-selection strategies are introduced to balance communication and sensing performance: a communication-centric scheme that maximizes downlink spectral efficiency (SE) and a sensing-centric scheme that selects geometrically diverse receive APs to enhance sensing coverage. Simulation results confirm the SE-sensing trade-off, where appropriate power allocation between communication and sensing and larger array apertures alleviate performance degradation, achieving high SE with millimeter-level sensing precision. We further demonstrate that the proposed AP-selection strategy reveals an optimal number of receive APs that maximizes sensing coverage without significantly sacrificing SE."}

For the first time, we formulate the signal model for MSMS beamspace MIMO transmission. Under synchronization errors, multi-antenna UTs enable the distributed MIMO channel to exhibit higher rank, supporting multiple data streams. Beamspace MIMO retains conventional codebook based beamforming while providing the performance gains of precoding. Based on the signal model, we propose statistical channel state information (sCSI)-based optimization of satellite clustering, beam selection, and transmit precoding, using a sum-rate upper-bound approximation. With given satellite clustering and beam selection, we cast precoder design as an equivalent covariance decomposition-based weighted minimum mean square error (CDWMMSE) problem. To obtain tractable algorithms, we develop a closed-form covariance decomposition required by CDWMMSE and derive an iterative MSMS beam-domain precoder under sCSI. Following this, we further propose several heuristic closed-form precoders to avoid iterative cost. For satellite clustering, we enhance a competition-based algorithm by introducing a mechanism to regulate the number of satellites serving certain UT. Furthermore, we design a two-stage low-complexity beam selection algorithm focused on enhancing the effective channel power. Simulations under practical configurations validate the proposed methods across the number of data streams, receive antennas, serving satellites, and active beams, and show that beamspace transmission approaches conventional MIMO performance at lower complexity."}
