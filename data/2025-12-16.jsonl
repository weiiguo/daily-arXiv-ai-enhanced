Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are one of the most abundant and diverse classes of signaling molecules used by living or non-living objects. VOC-based MC holds great promise in developing long-range, bio-compatible communication systems capable of interfacing nano- and micro-scale devices. In this paper, we present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for VOC-based interplant MC from an ICT perspective. The communication process is divided into three stages: transmission (VOC biosynthesis and emission from leaves), channel propagation (advection-diffusion in turbulent wind via Gaussian puff for stress-induced VOC release and Gaussian plume for constitutive VOC release), and reception (VOC uptake and physiological response in the receiver plant). Each stage is analyzed by its attenuation and delay. Numerical results demonstrate that VOC-based channels exhibit low-pass behavior, with bandwidth and capacity heavily influenced by distance, wind velocity, and noise. Though the physical channel supports moderate frequencies, biological constraints at the transmitter restrict the end-to-end channel to slow-varying signals."}

However, existing literature addresses these impairments in isolation, since their multiplicative coupling in the received signal severely limits conventional estimators and prevents simultaneous recovery. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-aperture FSO receiver architecture that leverages spatial diversity across a lens array to decouple these intertwined effects. Building on this hardware design, we propose a hierarchical deep learning framework that sequentially estimates AoA, transmitter pointing error, and turbulence coefficients. This decomposition significantly reduces learning complexity and enables robust inference even under strong atmospheric fading. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-MAP accuracy with orders-of-magnitude lower computational cost, and substantially outperforms end-to-end learning baselines in terms of estimation accuracy and generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate practical joint estimation of these three key parameters, paving the way for reliable, turbulence-resilient multi-aperture FSO systems."}

We propose the Sensing Dataset Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level specification and benchmark framework for large-scale wireless sensing. SDP defines how heterogeneous wireless signals are mapped into a unified perception data-block schema through lightweight synchronization, frequency-time alignment, and resampling, while a Canonical Polyadic-Alternating Least Squares (CP-ALS) pooling stage provides a task-agnostic representation that preserves multipath, spectral, and temporal structures. Built upon this protocol, a unified benchmark is established for detection, recognition, and vital-sign estimation with consistent preprocessing, training, and evaluation. Experiments under the cross-user split demonstrate that SDP significantly reduces variance (approximately 88%) across seeds while maintaining competitive accuracy and latency, confirming its value as a reproducible foundation for multi-modal and multitask sensing research."}

This paper presents a learning-driven dual-line laser scanning framework for fast and precise satellite positioning. Unlike conventional Gaussian-beam acquisition systems that rely on multiple sequential beams or mechanical steering, the proposed approach employs two orthogonal line-shaped laser beams to perform structured optical scanning over the ambiguity region without any moving parts. A physics-based model incorporating atmospheric attenuation, turbulence, and MRR-based reflection is developed, and a data-driven neural estimator is trained to map received optical energy patterns to the satellite's two-dimensional position. Simulation results demonstrate that the learning-driven method achieves near-MAP accuracy with typical errors of 7-10 m and deterministic scanning time of 1-2 ms, while conventional two-stage Gaussian-beam schemes exhibit comparable errors but random sensing durations of up to 5 ms. The proposed framework therefore offers a favorable trade-off between positioning accuracy, computational complexity, and sensing latency, making it a practical candidate for next-generation optical LEO tracking systems."}

Privacy is characterized by the $(ε, δ)$-hyperedge differential privacy (DP), an extension of the notion of $(ε, δ)$-edge DP in the literature. The hypergraph observations are modeled through a $h$-uniform stochastic block model ($h$-HSBM) in the dense regime. We investigate three differentially private mechanisms: stability-based, sampling-based, and perturbation-based mechanisms. We calculate the exact recovery threshold for each mechanism and study the contraction of the exact recovery region due to the privacy budget, $(ε, δ)$. Sampling-based mechanisms and randomized response mechanisms guarantee pure $ε$-hyperedge DP where $δ=0$, while the stability-based mechanisms cannot achieve this level of privacy. The dependence of the limits of the privacy budget on the parameters of the $h$-uniform hypergraph is studied. More precisely, it is proven rigorously that the minimum privacy budget scales logarithmically with the ratio between the density of in-cluster hyperedges and the cross-cluster hyperedges for stability-based and Bayesian sampling-based mechanisms, while this budget depends only on the size of the hypergraph for the randomized response mechanism."}

Two orthogonal line lasers perform synchronized longitudinal and transverse scanning to provide continuous, wide-area coverage across the roadway.

However, existing research often focuses narrowly on isolated domains, such as point-cloud geometry or energy analytics, without providing a scalable and interoperable workflow that integrates building geometry, equipment metadata, and operational data into a unified FM platform. This study proposes a comprehensive framework for scalable digital-twin deployment in smart campus buildings by integrating 3D laser scanning, BIM modeling, and IoT-enabled data visualization to support facility operations and maintenance. The methodology includes: (1) reality capture using terrestrial laser scanning and structured point-cloud processing; (2) development of an enriched BIM model incorporating architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, conveying, and sensor systems; and (3) creation of a digital-twin environment that links equipment metadata, maintenance policies, and simulated IoT data within a digital-twin management platform. A case study of the Price Gilbert Building at Georgia Tech demonstrates the implementation of this workflow. A total of 509 equipment items were modeled and embedded with OmniClass classifications into the digital twin. Ten interactive dashboards were developed to visualize system performance. Results show that the proposed framework enables centralized asset documentation, improved system visibility, and enhanced preventive and reactive maintenance workflows. Although most IoT data were simulated due to limited existing sensor infrastructure, the prototype validates the feasibility of a scalable digital twin for facility management and establishes a reference model for real-time monitoring, analytics integration, and future autonomous building operations."}

To address this limitation, we propose a new rotatable antenna array (RAA) architecture in this paper, which enables three-dimensional (3D) rotational control of an antenna array to provide enhanced spatial flexibility for null steering. To characterize its performance, we aim to jointly optimize the 3D rotational angles of the RAA, to maximize the beam gain over a given desired direction, while nulling those over multiple interference directions under zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming. However, this problem is non-convex and challenging to tackle due to the highly nonlinear expression of the beam gain in terms of the rotational angles. To gain insights, we first examine several special cases including both isotropic and directional antenna radiation patterns, deriving the conditions under which full beam gain can be achieved over the desired direction while meeting the nulling constraints for interference directions. These conditions clearly indicate that compared with FOA arrays, RAAs can significantly relax the angular separation requirement for achieving effective null steering. For other general cases, we propose a sequential update algorithm, that iteratively refines the 3D rotational angles by discretizing the 3D angular search space. To avoid undesired local optimum, a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure is also employed between two consecutive rounds of sequential update for solution exploration. Simulation results verify our analytical results and show superior null-steering performance of RAAs to FOA arrays."}

Directly fine-tuning LAMs for adaptation is often impractical due to prohibitive training costs, low inference efficiency in multi-user scenarios, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting, in addition to the limited accessibility of model parameters. To address these limitations, we establish a collaborative framework for air interface. In this framework, unlike prior approaches that either depend solely on LAMs or require direct fine-tuning, LAMs are exploited as a universal channel knowledge base while small artificial intelligence models (SAMs) are employed as lightweight plugins to capture environment-specific knowledge, facilitating efficient environment-specific adaptation of LAMs. Subsequently, we instantiate this framework for CSI feedback tasks, and develop a large and small collaboration framework for CSI feedback, referred to as LASCO. LASCO operates by letting the base LAM produce an initial CSI reconstruction, learning the environment-induced reconstruction shift through a reference SAM and a proxy SAM, and transferring this shift back to the LAM. To further enhance adaptability, we introduce elastic-LASCO (E-LASCO), which augments LASCO with learnable collaboration coefficients that control the contribution of LAMs and SAMs across different environments. Numerical results demonstrate that LASCO and E-LASCO enables LAMs to achieve environment-specific performance gains with significantly reduced training costs, lower data collection requirements, and faster adaptation speed."}

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can mitigate blockages, orientation issues, and mobility challenges, but their data rates remain far below those of direct LoS links. This article introduces the novel concept of movable access points (MAPs)-aided VLC systems, where dynamically repositioned APs provide new degrees of freedom to ensure LoS connectivity, and transmitter-receiver alignment while providing ultra-high data rates for mobile users.

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising solution for 6G networks due to its energy efficiency (EE) and low cost, while cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) was proposed as an innovative network architecture without fixed cell boundaries to enhance these measures even further. However, existing studies often assume consistently high traffic loads, neglecting the dynamic nature of user demand. This can result in underutilized access points (APs) and unnecessary energy expenditure during low-demand periods. To tackle the challenge of EE in CF-mMIMO systems during low load periods, this paper proposes a novel energy-efficient transmission scheme that jointly coordinates active APs and multiple passive RISs. Specifically, a dynamic AP sleep-mode strategy is designed, where certain APs are selectively deactivated while nearby RISs assist in maintaining coverage. We formulate the EE maximization objective as a fractional programming problem and adopt the Dinkelbach method in conjunction with alternating optimization (AO) to iteratively solve the three coupled subproblems: (i) AP selection via a hybrid branch-and-bound (BnB) and greedy algorithm, (ii) transmit power optimization using a sequential convex approximation (SCA) method, initialized by a heuristic zero-forcing strategy, and (iii) RIS phase shift optimization using gradient projection. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significantly higher EE than existing methods in both low and moderate user scenarios."}

Scalable 360 video tiling enables having elastic VR computational tasks that can be scaled adaptively in computation and data rate based on the available user and system resources. We integrate scalable 360 video tiling in an edge-client wireless multi-connectivity architecture for joint elastic task computation offloading across multiple VR users called ElasticVR. To balance the trade-offs in communication, computation, energy consumption, and QoE that arise herein, we formulate a constrained QoE and energy optimization problem that integrates the multi-user/multi-connectivity action space with the elasticity of VR computational tasks. The ElasticVR framework introduces two multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solutions, namely CPPG and IPPG. CPPG adopts a centralized training and centralized execution approach to capture the coupling between users' communication and computational demands. This leads to globally coordinated decisions at the cost of increased computational overheads and limited scalability. To address the latter challenges, we also explore an alternative strategy denoted IPPG that adopts a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. IPPG leverages shared information and parameter sharing to learn robust policies; however, during execution, each user takes action independently based on its local state information only. The decentralized execution alleviates the communication and computation overhead of centralized decision-making and improves scalability. We show that the ElasticVR framework improves the PSNR by 43.21%, while reducing the response time and energy consumption by 42.35% and 56.83%, respectively, compared with a case where no elasticity is incorporated into VR computations."}

To answer these questions, we conduct an empirical study on two representative tasks: CSI compression and temporal channel prediction. Models are trained and evaluated using in-domain, cross-domain, and small-data fine-tuning protocols. Across settings, we observe that stochastic-only evaluation may over- or under-estimate performance relative to RT. These findings support a task-aware recipe where stochastic models can be leveraged for scalable pre-training and for tasks that do not rely on strong spatiotemporal coupling.

Traditional communication paradigms centered on accuracy, throughput, and latency are increasingly inadequate for these systems, where the value of information depends on its semantic relevance to a specific task. This paper provides a unified exposition of the progression from classical distortion-based frameworks, through information freshness metrics such as the Age of Information (AoI) and its variants, to the emerging paradigm of goal-oriented semantics-aware communication. We organize and systematize existing semantics-aware metrics, including content- and version-aware measures, context-dependent distortion formulations, and history-dependent error persistence metrics that capture lasting impact and urgency. Within this framework, we highlight how these metrics address the limitations of purely accuracy- or freshness-centric designs, and how they collectively enable the selective generation and transmission of only task-relevant information. We further review analytical tools based on Markov decision process (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization methods that have been employed to characterize optimal or near-optimal timing and scheduling policies under semantic performance criteria and communication constraints. By synthesizing these developments into a coherent framework, the paper clarifies the design principles underlying goal-oriented, semantics-aware communication systems. It illustrates how they can significantly improve efficiency, reliability, and task performance. The presented perspective aims to serve as a bridge between information-theoretic, control-theoretic, and networking viewpoints, and to guide the design of semantic communication architectures for 6G and beyond."}

Full-duplex multi-tag AmBC systems provide the scalability and efficient spectrum utilization essential for next generation Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. However, the presence of multiple tags, self-interference and hardware impairments such as inphase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance, makes accurate channel estimation indispensable for efficient interference management. The large number of channel parameters and the presence of mirror images of each signal component necessitate careful design of the channel estimation phase to prevent performance degradation. In this work, we propose a novel three-stage training protocol and pilot-based estimation scheme that ensure signal orthogonality and successfully avoid error floors. We also propose two semi-blind estimators, one based on decision-directed (DD) criterion and the other on the expectation conditional maximization (ECM) framework. By exploiting both pilots and data symbols, these two estimators achieve higher estimation accuracy than pilot-based estimation, at the cost of additional complexity. Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for both types of estimation are also derived. The pilot-based estimator and the ECM estimator approach their respective CRBs, while the DD estimator performs mid-way between them. The three proposed solutions support different use cases by offering distinct tradeoffs between performance and computational complexity."}

The study introduces the concept of an AI capacity budget to quantify how the finite ability of a learning model constrains joint communication and sensing performance. Under this framework, the paper derives both converse (upper) and achievability (lower) bounds that define the achievable rate-sensing region. For Gaussian channels, the effect of limited learning capacity is shown to behave as an equivalent additive noise, allowing simple analytical expressions for the resulting communication rate and sensing distortion. The theory is then extended to Rayleigh and Rician fading as well as to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems through new matrix inequalities and a constructive mapping between AI capacity and effective noise covariance. Resource allocation between sensing and communication is optimized under this learning constraint, yielding closed-form conditions in the Gaussian case. A general learning-information trade-off law is also established, linking the representational power of the learning module to the achievable performance frontier. Finally, a practical variational training procedure is proposed to enforce the capacity constraint and to guide empirical evaluation. The derived scaling laws provide quantitative insight for co-designing model size, waveform, and hardware in next-generation ISAC systems."}

This fundamental transformation enables superior channel estimation (CE) performance in challenging propagation environments characterized by high-mobility, severe multipath effects, and rapidly time-varying channel conditions. This article provides a systematic examination of CE techniques for OTFS systems, covering the extensive research landscape from foundational methods to cutting-edge approaches. We present a detailed analysis of DD and TF domain CE techniques presented in the literature, including separate pilot, embedded pilot, and superimposed pilot approaches. The article encompasses various algorithmic frameworks including Bayesian learning, matching pursuit-based techniques, message passing algorithms, deep learning (DL)-based methods, and recent CE approaches. Additionally, we explore joint CE and signal detection (SD) strategies, the integration of OTFS with next-generation wireless systems including massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems.

The neural scaling law describes how the cross entropy rate of a foundation model -- such as a large language model -- changes with respect to the amount of training tokens, parameters, and compute. By contrast, Zipf's law posits that the distribution of tokens exhibits a power law tail. Whereas similar claims have been made in more specific settings, we show that the neural scaling law is a consequence of Zipf's law under certain broad assumptions that we reveal systematically. The derivation steps are as follows: We derive Heaps' law on the vocabulary growth from Zipf's law, Hilberg's hypothesis on the entropy scaling from Heaps' law, and the neural scaling from Hilberg's hypothesis. We illustrate these inference steps by a toy example of the Santa Fe process that satisfies all the four statistical laws."}

Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target."}

The system integrates three key stages: an SPS classifier module, a SIR predictor, and a bank of specialized U-Net autoencoders designed for different interference conditions. The classification block identifies the parameters required for cancellation. The recommender then directs the signal to the appropriate mitigation model, optionally incorporating SIR-based decisions for scenarios where successive interference cancellation may be advantageous. Experiments conducted across diverse SIR levels and modulation environments show that the recommender strategy improves robustness and reduces BER compared to using any single mitigation method alone. The results demonstrate the potential of adaptive, model-selective architectures to enhance interference resilience in dynamic communication environments."}

A simple version of this problem is the detection of a signal of interest with unknown parameters in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). When the parameters defining the signal are not known, an optimal detector (in the Neyman-Pearson sense) does not exist. An upper bound on the performance of any detector is the matched filter, which implies perfect sample by sample knowledge of the signal of interest. In recent years Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven to be very effective at hypothesis testing problems such as object detection and image classification. This paper examines the application of DNN-based approaches to the signal detection problem at the raw I/Q level and compares them to statistically based approaches as well as the Matched Filter.

This paper establishes theoretical performance limits for MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems under per-element constant-envelope (CE) transmission constraints. We demonstrate that hardware distortions -- specifically power amplifier nonlinearity, ADC quantization, and oscillator phase noise -- impose a capacity ceiling that cannot be overcome by increasing transmit power. A unified link budget framework integrates wideband beam squint, aperture pointing errors, and colored noise sources through a spectral consistency principle that ensures residual phase noise is counted exactly once across communication and sensing analyses. The sensing bounds are derived via the Whittle-Fisher Information Matrix under a Constant Acceleration kinematic model with jerk noise, yielding closed-form scaling laws: residual phase noise variance scales as $α^{-1}$ while dynamic state-estimation error (DSE) variance scales as $α^{-5}$ with pilot overhead $α$. Numerical results show divergent MIMO scaling: sensing precision improves with array size ($\\mathrm{RMSE} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{N_t N_r}$), while the critical SNR exhibits scale invariance regarding array size, implying that the distortion-limited transition point stabilizes regardless of the array scale.

Privacy is characterized by the $(ε, δ)$-hyperedge differential privacy (DP), an extension of the notion of $(ε, δ)$-edge DP in the literature. The hypergraph observations are modeled through a $h$-uniform stochastic block model ($h$-HSBM) in the dense regime. We investigate three differentially private mechanisms: stability-based, sampling-based, and perturbation-based mechanisms. We calculate the exact recovery threshold for each mechanism and study the contraction of the exact recovery region due to the privacy budget, $(ε, δ)$. Sampling-based mechanisms and randomized response mechanisms guarantee pure $ε$-hyperedge DP where $δ=0$, while the stability-based mechanisms cannot achieve this level of privacy. The dependence of the limits of the privacy budget on the parameters of the $h$-uniform hypergraph is studied. More precisely, it is proven rigorously that the minimum privacy budget scales logarithmically with the ratio between the density of in-cluster hyperedges and the cross-cluster hyperedges for stability-based and Bayesian sampling-based mechanisms, while this budget depends only on the size of the hypergraph for the randomized response mechanism."}
