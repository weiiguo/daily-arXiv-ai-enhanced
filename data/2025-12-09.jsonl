To exploit and mitigate these, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enabled transmit scheme for wideband near-field communications (NFC). Our solution leverages true-time-delay (TTD)-based hybrid beamfocusing architectures to mitigate spatial wideband effect and reduce radio frequency chain requirements. The objective is to maximize the minimum rate by jointly optimizing frequency-dependent analog beamfocusing, frequency-independent analog beamfocusing, digital beamfocusing, and common rate allocation. To solve this complicated non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based iterative algorithm that partitions the variables into three blocks and then employs block coordinate descent (BCD) to optimize each block alternately. This algorithm is further extended to support the sub-connected TTD-based analog beamfocusing architectures. Comprehensive simulation results indicate that our transmit scheme: 1) effectively compensates for spatial wideband effect, addressing a critical challenge in wideband operation; 2) achieves performance comparable to full digital beamfocusing while maintaining lower hardware complexity; 3) achieves substantial performance gains over the other two benchmarks."}

Unlike the majority of currently solved instances, which belong to a special class where all receivers with a certain side-information cardinality are either present or absent, we consider more general instances without this constraint. We devise a novel algorithm that constructs a decoding chain by iteratively adding a message that can be decoded by a receiver whose side information is already in the chain. If the decoding chain cannot proceed due to the absence of a receiver with the required messages, we skip a message by adding it to the chain regardless. We prove that a lower bound on the optimal broadcast rate is a function of the number of skipped messages, across all possible decoding choices of the receivers and any realisation of the algorithm for each decoding choice. While this result is not computationally feasible in isolation, it serves as a basis for deriving explicit lower bounds on the broadcast rate for specific classes of pliable-index-coding instances. These lower bounds depend on the number of absent receivers or the pattern of their side-information sets. Specifically, we explicitly characterise the optimal broadcast rate for instances with up to and including four absent receivers with any side-information pattern, as well as instances where the side-information sets are nested in particular ways."}

To facilitate the reliable navigation for cellular-connected UAVs, channel knowledge map (CKM) is considered a promising approach capable of tackling the non-negligible co-channel interference resulting from the high line-of-sight (LoS) probability of air-ground (AG) channels. Nevertheless, due to measurement constraints and the aging of information, CKM is usually incomplete and needs to be regularly updated to capture the dynamic nature of complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory design strategy in which UAV navigation and CKM completion are incorporated into a common framework, enabling mutual benefits for both tasks. Specifically, a cellular-connected UAV deployed in an urban environment measures the radio information during its flight and completes the CKM with Kriging interpolation. Based on the method of grid discretization and spherical approximation, a mixed-integer multi-objective optimization problem is formulated. The problem falls into the category of combinatorial mathematics and is essentially equivalent to determining an optimum sequence of grid points to traverse. Through proper mathematical manipulation, the problem is reformulated as variants of two classic models in graph theory, namely the shortest-path problem (SPP) and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Two navigation strategies based on the two different models are proposed and thoroughly compared based on numerical results to provide implementable methods for engineering practice and reveal the trade-offs between UAV navigation and CKM completion. Simulation results reveal that the proposed navigation strategies can quickly expand the Pareto boundary of the problem and approach the performance of fully-known CKM."}

For sparse multipath propagation and uniformly spaced antenna arrays, beamspace transformation, or application of a spatial FFT, concentrates the energy of each user into a small number of spatial frequency bins. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (LMMSE) detection performed in parallel using a beamspace window of small, fixed size for each user, even as the number of antennas and users scale up, while being robust to moderate variations in the relative powers of the users. In this paper, we develop a fundamental geometric understanding of this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' in a regime in which zero-forcing solutions do not exist. For simplified channel models, we show that, when we enforce a suitable separation in spatial frequency between users, the interference power falling into a desired user's beamspace window of size $W$ concentrates into a number of dominant eigenmodes smaller than $W$, with the desired user having relatively small projection onto these modes. Thus, linear suppression of dominant interference modes can be accomplished with small noise enhancement. We show that similar observations apply for MIMO-OFDM over wideband multipath channels synthesized from measured 28 GHz data. We propose, and evaluate via information-theoretic benchmarks, per-subcarrier reduced dimension beamspace LMMSE in this setting."}

Submitted to IEEE Wireless Communications Letters", "summary": "This letter describes how to improve performance of OFDM systems by combining non-equiprobable signaling with low density parity check (LDPC) coding. We partition a standard QAM constellation into annular subconstellations of equal size, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects subconstellations with large average energy less frequently than subconstellations with small average energy. In equiprobable signaling, the LDPC code selects a signal point from the inner subconstellation. In non-equiprobable signaling this inner signal point has a representative in each subconstellation and the shaping code selects the representative for transmission. It is possible to use standard QAM constellations to achieve any desired fractional bit rate with this method of shaping the energy distribution of the transmitted signal. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We present simulation results for non-equiprobable transmission at $1.5$ bits/symbol on a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. As the transmission rate increases, the gains from non-equiprobable signaling diminish, but we show through simulation that they are still significant for $16$-QAM."}

This work proposes a cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework enabling drone detection within the existing communication network infrastructure, while maintaining communication services. The system exploits the spatial diversity and coordination of distributed access points (APs) in a cell-free massive MIMO architecture to detect aerial passive targets. To evaluate sensing performance, we introduce two key metrics: age of sensing (AoS), capturing the freshness of sensing information, and sensing coverage. The proposed AoS metric includes not only the transmission delays as in the existing models, but also the processing for sensing and networking delay, which are critical in dynamic environments like drone detection. We introduce an ambiguity parameter quantifying the similarity between the target-to-receiver channels for two hotspots and develop a novel network configuration strategy, including hotspot grouping, AP clustering, and sensing pilot assignment, leveraging simultaneous multi-point sensing to minimize AoS. Our results show that the best trade-off between AoS and sensing coverage is achieved when the number of hotspots sharing the same time/frequency resource matches the number of sensing pilots, indicating ambiguity as the primary factor limiting the sensing performance."}

Optimising redundancy for insertion and deletion channels remains a key open problem with significant importance for applications in DNA data storage and document exchange. Recently, a coding framework known as function-correcting codes has been proposed to address the challenge of minimising redundancy while preserving specific functions of the message. This framework has gained attention due to its potential applications in machine learning systems and long-term archival data storage. Motivated by the problem of redundancy optimisation for insertion and deletion channels, we propose a new framework called function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In this paper, we introduce the notions of function-correcting insertion codes, function-correcting deletion codes, and function-correcting insdel codes, and we show that these three formulations are equivalent. We then define insdel distance matrices and irregular insdel-distance codes, and derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal redundancy achievable by function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In addition, we establish Gilbert-Varshamov and Plotkin-like bounds on the length of irregular insdel-distance codes. Using the relation between optimal redundancy and the length of such codes, we obtain a simplified lower bound on optimal redundancy. Finally, we derive bounds on the optimal redundancy of function-correcting insdel codes for several classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, VT syndrome functions, the number-of-runs function, and the maximum-run-length function."}

As aperture size increases, conventional full-array MVDR processing becomes prohibitive due to the cubic complexity of covariance estimation and inversion. Building on the principle of energy concentration in beamspace, we introduce a tiled windowed-beamspace MVDR framework that distributes spatial FFT processing across subarrays while performing joint beamforming in a compact global beamspace domain. Each tile applies a 2D spatial DFT followed by an angle-of-arrival dependent beamspace window, producing a reduced-dimensional representation that preserves the dominant spatial structure of the received signal. The windowed outputs from the tiles are concatenated and processed by a centralized MVDR beamformer, enabling coherent full-aperture processing with drastically reduced dimensionality. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves detection and interference suppression performance comparable to full-dimensional processing, while substantially lowering computational cost, memory usage, and training requirements. The framework also reveals tradeoffs among tile size, window size, and beamspace resolution that govern overall system scalability."}

In this paper, we focus on pure qLRCs derived from the Hermitian construction. We provide several new bounds for pure qLRCs and demonstrate that they are tighter than previously known bounds. Moreover, we show that a variety of classical QECCs, including quantum Hamming codes, quantum GRM codes, and quantum Solomon-Stiffler codes, give rise to pure qLRCs with explicit parameters.

This novel self-supervised pretraining framework couples a large localization model (LM) with a neural radio-frequency radiance field (RF-NeRF) in an asymmetrical autoencoder architecture. In this design, the LM encodes received RF spectra into latent, position-relevant representations, while the RF-NeRF decodes them to reconstruct the original spectra. This alignment between input and output enables effective representation learning using large-scale, unlabeled RF data, which can be collected continuously with minimal effort. To this end, we collected RF samples at 7,327,321 positions across 100 diverse scenes using four common wireless technologies--RFID, BLE, WiFi, and IIoT. Data from 75 scenes were used for training, and the remaining 25 for evaluation.

We introduce a definition of BS-EEMDOFs based on the Jacobian of the observed fields with respect to the load configuration. We derive a closed-form expression from multiport network theory which demonstrates that the number of BS-EEMDOFs is fundamentally a distributed variable, whose distribution depends on the mutual coupling between the backscatter elements and the coherent illumination. The modes associated with BS-EEMDOFs lie in the column space of the end-to-end channel matrix from backscatter array ports to receiver ports, but the number of BS-EEMDOFs is generally different from the number of benchmark EEMDOFs associated with the same array being coherently fed rather than tunably terminated.

First, we analyzed the potential impact of the movement patterns of teeth grinding on radar echo signals. Based on this analysis, 11 features were extracted. Subsequently, using these features, we performed classification with a Random Forest model on the dataset constructed via millimeter-wave radar. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 96.1% on the test set, with precision, recall, and F1-score all remaining at a relatively high level. This study validates the effectiveness of millimeter-wave radar for SB recognition, providing a non-invasive and privacy-friendly alternative to existing recognition techniques. Future research will focus on enhancing the robustness of the method across diverse populations and environments, as well as striving to mitigate the interference of other facial micro-movements on teeth grinding recognition."}

We focus on the primitive variant, where each relay observes a noisy version of the source signal and forwards a compressed description over an orthogonal, noiseless, finite-rate link to the destination. Compress-and-forward (CF) is particularly effective in this setting, especially under oblivious relaying where relays lack access to the source codebook. While neural CF methods have been studied in single-relay channels, extending them to the two-relay case is non-trivial, as it requires fully distributed compression without any inter-relay coordination. We demonstrate that learning-based quantizers at the relays can harness input correlations by operating remote, yet in a collaborative fashion, enabling effective distributed compression in line with Berger-Tung-style coding. Each relay separately compresses its observation using a one-shot learned quantizer, and the destination jointly decodes the source message. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme, trained end-to-end with finite-order modulation, operates close to the known theoretical bounds. These results demonstrate that neural CF can scale to multi-relay systems while maintaining both performance and interpretability."}

For sparse multipath propagation and uniformly spaced antenna arrays, beamspace transformation, or application of a spatial FFT, concentrates the energy of each user into a small number of spatial frequency bins. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (LMMSE) detection performed in parallel using a beamspace window of small, fixed size for each user, even as the number of antennas and users scale up, while being robust to moderate variations in the relative powers of the users. In this paper, we develop a fundamental geometric understanding of this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' in a regime in which zero-forcing solutions do not exist. For simplified channel models, we show that, when we enforce a suitable separation in spatial frequency between users, the interference power falling into a desired user's beamspace window of size $W$ concentrates into a number of dominant eigenmodes smaller than $W$, with the desired user having relatively small projection onto these modes. Thus, linear suppression of dominant interference modes can be accomplished with small noise enhancement. We show that similar observations apply for MIMO-OFDM over wideband multipath channels synthesized from measured 28 GHz data. We propose, and evaluate via information-theoretic benchmarks, per-subcarrier reduced dimension beamspace LMMSE in this setting."}

By analyzing how materials change RSSI and phase, the system identifies the contents of a package without opening it. Using orientation inferred from phase differences, tag occlusion, and antenna gain patterns, the system selects the tag with the greatest occlusion for accurate material sensing. We evaluate two and three tag configurations, and show that both can deliver high orientation and material sensing performance through the use of machine learning classifiers, even in realistic RF environments. When combined into a unified pipeline, TagLabel achieves more than 80 percent accuracy across all package orientations. Because it requires only standard RFID hardware and offers fast scanning times, this approach provides a practical way to enhance package inspection and improve automation in logistics operations."}

We partition a standard QAM constellation into annular subconstellations of equal size, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects subconstellations with large average energy less frequently than subconstellations with small average energy. In equiprobable signaling, the LDPC code selects a signal point from the inner subconstellation. In non-equiprobable signaling this inner signal point has a representative in each subconstellation and the shaping code selects the representative for transmission. It is possible to use standard QAM constellations to achieve any desired fractional bit rate with this method of shaping the energy distribution of the transmitted signal. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We present simulation results for non-equiprobable transmission at $1.5$ bits/symbol on a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. As the transmission rate increases, the gains from non-equiprobable signaling diminish, but we show through simulation that they are still significant for $16$-QAM."}

Existing approaches face fundamental trade-offs: magnetic-based methods (NFC/NFMI) achieve low power but are limited to sub-megabit rates, while millimeter-wave techniques provide gigabits/sec connectivity at higher power consumption and only centimeter-scale ranges. We demonstrate that near-field electric (NFE) communication breaks this trade-off via capacitive coupling enabled by confined electric fields. NFE simultaneously achieves ultra-low power ($<$1 mW per transceiver), high-speed data throughput ($>$3 Mbps), and configurable decimeter-range (5-30 cm) capabilities previously considered mutually exclusive. Systematic measurements across multiple orientations and configurations show NFE can support decimeter communication coverage. The power consumption of 0.4 mW at the transmitter (Tx) and 0.6 mW at the receiver (Rx), when combined is up to $\\sim$24$\\times$ lower than NFC and $\\sim$3$\\times$ lower than NFMI while achieving significantly higher data rates, and a couple of orders of magnitude lower power than mm-wave based technique. Testing with symmetrical electrodes across eight orientations validated consistent performance and robustness for practical deployments. Extended-range experiments achieved stable 2 Mbps throughput at 3.5 meters using conductive media, demonstrating NFE's unique ability to leverage environmental conductors. Optimized device design can facilitate achieving an extended range for Body-assisted NFE up to 1 m. Results establish NFE as foundational for next-generation wireless applications where security, low power, and throughput converge, enabling dense IoT deployments, secure payment systems, and high-speed device-to-device communication previously limited by the power-performance trade-off."}

The observed data follow a linear structural vector autoregressive model (SVARM) with both instantaneous and time-lagged dependencies, where the instantaneous structure is modeled by a DAG to reflect potential causal relationships. While recent continuous relaxation approaches impose acyclicity through smooth constraint functions involving powers of the adjacency matrix, they lead to non-convex optimization problems that are challenging to solve. In contrast, we assume that the underlying DAG has only non-negative edge weights, and leverage this additional structure to impose acyclicity via a convex constraint. This enables us to cast the problem of non-negative DAG recovery from multivariate time-series data as a convex optimization problem in abstract form, which we solve using the method of multipliers. Crucially, the convex formulation guarantees global optimality of the solution. Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed method on synthetic time-series data, where it outperforms existing alternatives."}

We train a multi-layer perceptron to map noisy measurement vectors to binary defect indicators, achieving accurate and robust recovery even under sparse, bounded perturbations. Beyond accuracy, we show that the trained network implicitly learns the underlying pooling structure that links items to tests, allowing this structure to be recovered directly from the network's Jacobian. This indicates that the model does not merely memorize training patterns but internalizes the true combinatorial relationships governing QGT. Our findings reveal that standard feedforward architectures can learn verifiable inverse mappings in structured combinatorial recovery problems."}

In order to realize XL-MIMO costeffectively, an innovative ray antenna array (RAA) architecture with directly-connected uniform linear array (ULA) was recently proposed, which achieves flexible beamforming without relying on traditional analog phase shifters or digital beamforming. However, RAA suffers from the signal blockage issue since its ray-configured ULAs are placed in the same plane. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel antenna array architecture termed cylinder directly-connected antenna array (DCAA), which is achieved via multiple simple uniform circular array (sUCA) with carefully designed orientations in a layered three-dimensional structure. The so-called sUCA partitions the uniform circular array (UCA) into two sub-arrays where each sub-array has all antenna elements directly connected to achieve a desired beam direction corresponding to the sub-array's physical orientation, thus achieving full spatial coverage. Compared with the conventional ULA architecture with hybrid analog/digital beamforming (HBF), the proposed cylinder DCAA can achieve uniform spatial resolution, enhanced communication rate and lower hardware costs.
