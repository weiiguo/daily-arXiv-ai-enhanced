Specifically, the noisy nanopore channel (NNC) with\nthe Scrappie pore model generates average output levels via i.i.d. geometric\nsample duplications corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian noise (NNC-Scrappie).\nSimplified message passing algorithms are derived for efficient soft decoding\nof nanopore signals using NNC-Scrappie. Previously, evaluation of this channel\nmodel was limited by the lack of DNA storage datasets with nanopore signals\nincluded. This is solved by deriving an achievable rate based on the dynamic\ntime-warping (DTW) algorithm that can be applied to genomic sequencing datasets\nsubject to constraints that make the resulting rate applicable to DNA storage.\nUsing a publicly-available dataset from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), it\nis demonstrated that coding over multiple DNA strands of $100$ bases in length\nand decoding with the NNC-Scrappie decoder can achieve rates of at least\n$0.64-1.18$ bits per base, depending on the channel quality of the nanopore\nthat is chosen in the sequencing device per channel-use, and $0.96$ bits per\nbase on average assuming uniformly chosen nanopores.

Several follow-up decoding\nalgorithms reduced the number of steps, but for a limited set of parameters, or\nat the expense of reduced performance, or relying on the existence of some\ncombinatorial structures. We show that any one-step majority-logic decoder-that\nis, a decoder performing all majority votes in one step simultaneously without\nsequential processing-can correct at most d_min/4 errors for all values of r\nand m, where d_min denotes the code's minimum distance. We then introduce a new\nhard-decision decoder that completes the decoding in a single step and attains\nthis error-correction limit. It applies to all r and m, and can be viewed as a\nparallel realization of Reed's original algorithm, decoding all message symbols\nsimultaneously. Remarkably, we also prove that the decoder is optimum in the\nerasure setting: it recovers the message from any erasure pattern of up to\nd_min-1 symbols-the theoretical limit.

To enable tractable\ninference, we replace environment-dependent BDD domain grids with uniformly\nsampled ones, and introduce perturbation parameters in each domain to mitigate\ngrid mismatch. We further propose a hybrid beam domain strategy that integrates\nangle-only sampling with slope hyperparameterization to avoid the computational\nburden of explicit slope sampling.

Besides\nit addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for\nexample, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by\njointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown\nprecoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet\nfollowed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive\n(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet\nchannel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded\nPRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel\nspatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet\nsignificantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a\nwide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB\ngain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen\nchannel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations\nunder dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations."}

However, these gains come at the cost of severe path loss\nand a heightened risk of beam misalignment due to user mobility, especially\npronounced in near-field communication. Traditional solutions rely on extremely\ndirectional beamforming and frequent beam updates via beam management, but such\ntechniques impose formidable computational and signaling overhead. In response,\nwe propose a novel approach termed trajectory-adaptive beam shaping (TABS) that\neliminates the need for real-time beam management by shaping the\nelectromagnetic wavefront to follow the user's predefined trajectory. Drawing\ninspiration from self-accelerating beams in optics, TABS concentrates energy\nalong pre-defined curved paths corresponding to the user's motion without\nrequiring real-time beam reconfiguration. We further introduce a dedicated\nquantitative metric to characterize performance under the TABS framework.\nComprehensive simulations substantiate the superiority of TABS in terms of link\nperformance, overhead reduction, and implementation complexity."}

This decoupling enables coordinated yet independently\nconfigurable designs in the AMAF and T-RIS domains, supporting flexible\nstrategies with diverse complexity-performance trade-offs. Several\nimplementations are analyzed, including diagonal and non-diagonal T-RIS\narchitectures, paired with precoding schemes based on focusing, minimum mean\nsquare error, and eigenmode decomposition. Simulation results demonstrate that\nwhile non-diagonal schemes maximize sum rate in scenarios with a limited number\nof User Equipments (UEs) and high angular separability, they exhibit fairness\nand scalability limitations as UE density increases. Conversely, diagonal T-RIS\nconfigurations, particularly the proposed focusing-based scheme with uniform\nfeeder-side power allocation, offer robust, fair, and scalable performance with\nminimal channel state information. The findings emphasize the critical impact\nof UEs' angular separability and reveal inherent trade-offs among spectral\nefficiency, complexity, and fairness, positioning diagonal AT-RIS architectures\nas practical solutions for scalable near-field MU multiple-input single-output\nsystems."}

In\nthis context, accurate statistical modeling of the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is essential for enabling\ntractable performance analysis of multi-user systems. This paper presents an\nimproved statistical approximation of the SINR for downlink (DL) MU-MIMO\nsystems with imperfect CSIT. The proposed model retains the analytical\nsimplicity of existing approaches (e.g., Gamma-based approximations) while\novercoming their limitations, particularly the underestimation of SINR\nvariance. We evaluate the proposed approximation in the context of\nRate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-enabled MIMO DL systems with outdated\nCSIT.

To this\npoint, the term efficiency has been quantified through applications to Spectral\nEfficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE). In this paper we introduce a new\nsystem metric called Radio Resource Utilization Efficiency (RUE). This metric\nquantifies the efficiency of the available radio resources (Spectrum, Access\nMethod, Time Slots, Data Symbols, etc.) used to deliver future 6G demands. We\ncompare the system performance of Typical Cellular and Cell-Free Massive MIMO\ndeployments as a vehicle to demonstrate the need for this new metric. We begin\nby providing a concise treatment of items impacting SE by introducing three\ncategories: 5G Radio Resources, Practical Limitations (such as channel matrix\nrank deficiency) and Implementation Losses (SINR degradation). For the example\nRadio Access Technology configuration analyzed, we show 5G yields an RUE of 47%\n(revealing significant room for improvement when defining 6G). Practical\nlimitation assumptions are compared to 5G Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO)\nmeasurements conducted in a commercialized deployment. SE losses are\ncharacterized to offer guidance to advanced algorithms employing Machine\nLearning (ML) based techniques. We present the benefits of increasing the\ntransmission Bandwidth (BW) from 100MHz to 1.6GHz. We describe a Next\nGeneration RAN architecture that can support 6G and AI-RAN."}
