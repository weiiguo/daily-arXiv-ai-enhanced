### [1] [Bounds and New Constructions for Girth-Constrained Regular Bipartite Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11268)
*Sheida Rabeti,Mohsen Moradi,Hessam Mahdavifar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了正则二分图的设计与分析，重点关注其在LDPC码中的应用，尤其是高码率下约束围长的情况。通过分析围长与节点集大小的关系，提出了两种构造方法，并证明了其渐近最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则二分图在LDPC码中具有重要应用，尤其是在高码率和约束围长的场景下。研究其设计与分析有助于优化LDPC码的性能。

Method: 1. 推导了正则二分图中节点集大小的界限；2. 提出了两种构造方法：基于贪心算法的$(w_c, w_r)$-正则图和基于半正则图的构造，后者利用了无长度3算术序列的整数序列。

Result: 证明了两种构造方法在围长为8时的渐近最优性，并展示了其在高码率中长块长下的稀疏性。

Conclusion: 本文的图论结果为设计高围长和最小距离的LDPC码提供了理论支持，尤其适用于高码率场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the design and analysis of regular bipartite graphs
motivated by their application in low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes
specifically with constrained girth and in the high-rate regime. We focus on
the relation between the girth of the graph, and the size of the sets of
variable and check nodes. We derive bounds on the size of the vertices in
regular bipartite graphs, showing how the required number of check nodes grows
with respect to the number of variable nodes as girth grows large. Furthermore,
we present two constructions for bipartite graphs with girth $\mathcal{G} = 8$;
one based on a greedy construction of $(w_c, w_r)$-regular graphs, and another
based on semi-regular graphs which have uniform column weight distribution with
a sublinear number of check nodes. The second construction leverages sequences
of integers without any length-$3$ arithmetic progression and is asymptotically
optimal while maintaining a girth of $8$. Also, both constructions can offer
sparse parity-check matrices for high-rate codes with medium-to-large block
lengths. Our results solely focus on the graph-theoretic problem but can
potentially contribute to the ongoing effort to design LDPC codes with high
girth and minimum distance, specifically in high code rates.

### [2] [Decentralized Uplink Adaptive Compression for Cell-Free MIMO with Limited Fronthaul](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11284)
*Zehua Li,Jingjie Wei,Raviraj Adve*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于速率的自适应压缩方法，用于解决小区自由多输入多输出网络中上行链路压缩问题，优于传统的基于变换的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小区自由多输入多输出网络中上行链路压缩问题，解决传统基于变换方法无法适应网络流量和有限前传容量变化的局限性。

Method: 提出基于速率的方法，自适应确定压缩维度，利用互信息作为目标，实现理论网络容量，并通过解耦表达式实现去中心化。

Result: 通过信道统计和用户流量密度，展示了高效侧信息表示方法，去中心化实现表现出与集中式方法竞争的网络性能。

Conclusion: 自适应压缩方法在保持低信息交换开销的同时，实现了与集中式方法相当的全局网络性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of uplink compression for cell-free multi-input
multi-output networks with limited fronthaul capacity. In compress-forward
mode, remote radio heads (RRHs) compress the received signal and forward it to
a central unit for joint processing. While previous work has focused on a
transform-based approach, which optimizes the transform matrix that reduces
signals of high dimension to a static pre-determined lower dimension, we
propose a rate-based approach that simultaneously finds both dimension and
compression adaptively. Our approach accommodates for changes to network
traffic and fronthaul limits. Using mutual information as the objective, we
obtain the theoretical network capacity for adaptive compression and decouple
the expression to enable decentralization. Furthermore, using channel
statistics and user traffic density, we show different approaches to compute an
efficient representation of side information that summarizes global channel
state information and is shared with RRHs to assist compression. While keeping
the information exchange overhead low, our decentralized implementation of
adaptive compression shows competitive overall network performance compared to
a centralized approach.

### [4] [The complete weight distribution of a family of irreducible cyclic codes of dimension two](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11349)
*Gerardo Vega,Félix Hernández*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了循环码的完全权重分布问题，通过多项式分解方法解决了这一难题，并应用于构建最优或接近最优的系统认证码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环码在数据存储、密码学等领域有广泛应用，但其完全权重分布问题长期未解决，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过分解多项式$x^{q+1}-c$，无需计算复杂指数和，直接得到一类不可约循环码的完全权重分布。

Result: 成功确定了任意有限域上的一类不可约循环码的完全权重分布，并用于构建最优认证码。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了完全权重分布的计算，为循环码的实际应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: An important family of codes for data storage systems, cryptography, consumer
electronics, and network coding for error control in digital communications are
the so-called cyclic codes. This kind of linear codes are also important due to
their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. Because of this, cyclic codes
have been studied for many years, however their complete weight distributions
are known only for a few cases. The complete weight distribution has a wide
range of applications in many research fields as the information it contains is
of vital use in practical applications. Unfortunately, obtaining these
distributions is in general a very hard problem that normally involves the
evaluation of sophisticated exponential sums, which leaves this problem open
for most of the cyclic codes. In this paper we determine, for any finite field
$\bbbf_q$, the explicit factorization of any polynomial of the form
$x^{q+1}-c$, where $c \in \bbbf_{q}^*$. Then we use this result to obtain,
without the need to evaluate any kind of exponential sum, the complete weight
distributions of a family of irreducible cyclic codes of dimension two over any
finite field. As an application of our findings, we employ the complete weight
distributions of some irreducible cyclic codes presented here to construct
systematic authentication codes, showing that they are optimal or almost
optimal.

### [5] [Black-Box Edge AI Model Selection with Conformal Latency and Accuracy Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11391)
*Anders E. Kalør,Tomoaki Ohtsuki*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的黑盒模型选择框架，用于满足6G边缘AI的实时性和准确性需求，结合了保形风险控制和非参数统计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G应用（如自动驾驶和机器人）需要低延迟和高精度的边缘AI服务，但由于ML模型的黑盒性质、任务复杂性以及无线信道的随机性，实现这一目标具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种基于保形风险控制和非参数统计的黑盒模型选择框架，包括固定（基于信道统计）和动态（信道自适应）两种模型选择方案。

Result: 数值实验验证了框架在满足截止时间和误分类概率要求下的有效性，特别是在图像分类任务中。

Conclusion: 该框架有望为6G提供可靠的实时边缘AI服务。

Abstract: Edge artificial intelligence (AI) will be a central part of 6G, with powerful
edge servers supporting devices in performing machine learning (ML) inference.
However, it is challenging to deliver the latency and accuracy guarantees
required by 6G applications, such as automated driving and robotics. This stems
from the black-box nature of ML models, the complexities of the tasks, and the
interplay between transmitted data quality, chosen inference model, and the
random wireless channel. This paper proposes a novel black-box model selection
framework for reliable real-time wireless edge AI designed to meet predefined
requirements on both deadline violation probability and expected loss.
Leveraging conformal risk control and non-parametric statistics, our framework
intelligently selects the optimal model combination from a collection of
black-box feature-extraction and inference models of varying complexities and
computation times. We present both a fixed (relying on channel statistics) and
a dynamic (channel-adaptive) model selection scheme. Numerical results validate
the framework on a deadline-constrained image classification task while
satisfying a maximum misclassification probability requirement. These results
indicate that the proposed framework has the potential to provide reliable
real-time edge AI services in 6G.

Motivation: 探索有限域上二项式函数的微分和回旋镖性质，填补非完美非线性函数类在回旋镖均匀性方面的研究空白。

Method: 分析二项式函数$F_{r,u}(x)$在不同模条件下的性质，计算其微分和回旋镖谱。

Result: 发现$F_{r,\pm1}$在特定条件下具有局部完美非线性或局部几乎完美非线性，并给出其回旋镖均匀性。

Conclusion: 该研究为有限域上非完美非线性函数类的性质提供了新的理论支持，并扩展了相关领域的研究范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the differential and boomerang properties of a
class of binomial $F_{r,u}(x) = x^r(1 + u\chi(x))$ over the finite field
$\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $r = \frac{p^n+1}{4}$, $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, and
$\chi(x) = x^{\frac{p^n -1}{2}}$ is the quadratic character in
$\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. We show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-PN with boomerang
uniformity $0$ when $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$. To the best of our knowledge, the
second known non-PN function class with boomerang uniformity $0$, and the first
such example over odd characteristic fields with $p > 3$. Moreover, we show
that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-APN with boomerang uniformity at most $2$ when
$p^n \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$. We also provide complete classifications of the
differential and boomerang spectra of $F_{r,\pm1}$. Furthermore, we thoroughly
investigate the differential uniformity of $F_{r,u}$ for $u\in
\mathbb{F}_{p^n}^* \setminus \{\pm1\}$.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的极化码结构，用于有记忆信道，以提高极化效率，接近传统极化码在无记忆信道上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对有记忆信道（特别是有限状态信道中的子注入式网格信道）中极化效率不足的问题，提出改进方案。

Method: 在极化码结构的每一层最后一个核替换为交换矩阵，形成“最后一对交换结构”。

Result: 仿真显示，在子注入式网格信道上，新结构的极化效率优于传统结构；在双射式网格信道上，性能与无记忆信道上的传统极化码相同。

Conclusion: 新结构在特定有记忆信道上显著提升性能，理论证明其在双射式网格信道上达到最优极化效率。

Abstract: A new structure of polar codes is proposed for channels with memory to
improve polarization and approach the polarization efficiency of conventional
polar codes on memoryless channels. We classify trellis channels, a particular
type of finite state channels into two categories, called sub-injective trellis
channels and non-sub-injective trellis channels, where an explicit polarization
loss is observed on the former. For sub-injective trellis channels, we
substitute the last kernel of each layer in polar coding structure by a
swapping matrix, thus leading to our proposed coding structure named last-pair
swapping structure. Simulation shows on sub-injective trellis channels
polarization efficiency of the proposed polar code exceeds that of conventional
one. Furthermore, we point out a special type of sub-injective trellis
channels, called bijective trellis channels, and indicate on them the proposed
structure achieves identical polarization efficiency with that of conventional
one on memoryless channels, which is later theoretically proved. Moreover,
limit of the proposed structure is also analyzed. Simulation results of error
rate are given on continuous phase modulation (CPM) with additional white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, showing a considerable signal-to-noise power
ratio (snr) gain of the proposed polar code over conventional one, and
identical performances between the proposed polar code on bijective trellis
channels and conventional one on memoryless channels.

### [8] [Brain2Vec: A Deep Learning Framework for EEG-Based Stress Detection Using CNN-LSTM-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11179)
*Md Mynoddin,Troyee Dev,Rishita Chakma*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Brain2Vec是一种新的深度学习工具，结合卷积、循环和注意力机制，用于从原始EEG信号中分类压力状态，在DEAP数据集上表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康压力普遍影响认知健康，需要开发非侵入性诊断工具。EEG信号直接反映神经活动，但其非平稳性和高维度特性带来建模挑战。

Method: 采用混合架构（卷积层、LSTM层和注意力机制）处理EEG信号，预处理包括带通滤波、z-score归一化和分段。

Result: 在DEAP数据集上，AUC得分为0.68，验证准确率为81.25%，优于传统CNN-LSTM基线。

Conclusion: Brain2Vec有望集成到可穿戴压力监测平台和个性化医疗系统中。

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and
overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window
into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature
poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep
learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a
hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The
model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial
dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,
and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal
regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass
filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM
baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation
accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for
integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized
healthcare systems.

### [9] [Design of 3D Beamforming and Deployment Strategies for ISAC-based HAPS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11294)
*Xue Zhang,Bang Huang,Mohamed-Slim Alouini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了集成感知与通信（ISAC）支持的高空平台站（HAPS）系统，同时进行通信和SAR成像，优化部署策略和3D波束成形以最大化通信吞吐量并满足SAR要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索HAPS系统在ISAC支持下的潜力，同时实现多用户通信和地面目标感知，解决部署策略和资源分配的优化问题。

Method: 提出两种HAPS部署策略（准静态和动态），联合优化部署策略和3D波束成形，利用凸和非凸优化技术求解非凸问题。

Result: 数值结果表明所提方法在通信吞吐量和SAR成像性能上优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 通过优化HAPS部署和波束成形，ISAC支持的HAPS系统能有效兼顾通信和感知需求。

Abstract: This paper explores high-altitude platform station (HAPS) systems enabled by
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), in which a HAPS simultaneously
transmits communication signals and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging
signals to support multi-user communication while performing ground target
sensing. Taking into account the operational characteristics of SAR imaging, we
consider two HAPS deployment strategies: (i) a quasi-stationary HAPS that
remains fixed at an optimized location during SAR operation, following the
stop-and-go scanning model; and (ii) a dynamic HAPS that continuously adjusts
its flight trajectory along a circular path. For each strategy, we aim at
maximizing the weighted sum-rate throughput for communication users while
ensuring that SAR imaging requirements, such as beampattern gain and
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are satisfied. This is achieved by jointly
optimizing the HAPS deployment strategy, i.e., its placement or trajectory,
along with three-dimensional (3D) transmit beamforming, under practical
constraints including transmit power limits, energy consumption, and flight
dynamics. Nevertheless, the formulated optimization problems corresponding to
the two deployment strategies are inherently non-convex. To address the issue,
we propose efficient algorithms that leverage both convex and non-convex
optimization techniques to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approaches
over benchmark schemes.

### [10] [A Compact Dynamic Omnidirectional Antenna](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11351)
*Sheng Huang,Jacob R. Randall,Cory Hilton,Jeffrey A. Nanzer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型全向天线设计，结合方向调制实现安全的窄平面信息传输，具有紧凑尺寸和稳定的全向辐射性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过方向调制技术增强平面物理信息安全，同时保持天线的紧凑性和全向性能。

Method: 采用两个紧密排列的印刷曲折线单极天线作为单一辐射单元，通过双端口差分功率激励和实时动态切换实现窄信息安全区域。

Result: 实验验证了16-QAM和256-QAM传输下的窄E平面信息束（约34°和15°）和全向H平面信息束，表明天线在紧凑动态系统中有效提升信息安全。

Conclusion: 该天线设计为增强平面物理信息安全提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel omnidirectional antenna design incorporating directional
modulation for secure narrow planar information transmission. The proposed
antenna features a compact size and stable omnidirectional radiation
performance by employing two tightly spaced, printed meander line monopole
antennas, acting as a single radiating element. To achieve a narrow information
secure region, the proposed antenna is fed by differential power excitation of
two ports with real-time dynamic switching. This leads to phase pattern
modulation only along the electrical polarization, resulting in directionally
confined information recoverable region in the E-plane, while maintaining
highly constant or static omnidirectional H-plane pattern, inducing a
$360^\circ$ information recoverable region. The dynamic antenna is designed and
fabricated on a single layer of Rogers RO4350B which provides a miniaturized
planar size of $0.36 \times 0.5 , \lambda_0^2$ at 2.7 GHz and easy integration.
To validate the wireless communication performance, the fabricated antenna is
directly fed with a 10 dB power ratio by a radio frequency (RF) switching
system and evaluated for 16-QAM and 256-QAM transmission in a high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
for 16-QAM transmission, a narrow E-plane information beam (IB) of
approximately $34^\circ$ and omnidirectional H-plane IB are obtained, and a
narrower E-plane IB is achieved around $15^\circ$ for 256-QAM. These results
confirm that the proposed antenna offers a simple yet effective approach to
enhance planar physical information security with a compact dynamic antenna
system.

### [11] [Deep Learning-based mmWave MIMO Channel Estimation using sub-6 GHz Channel Information: CNN and UNet Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11714)
*Faruk Pasic,Lukas Eller,Stefan Schwarz,Markus Rupp,Christoph F. Mecklenbräuker*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于深度学习的毫米波MIMO信道估计方法，利用sub-6 GHz频段的带外信息，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波频段的信道估计因低信噪比而具有挑战性，需利用sub-6 GHz频段信息提升性能。

Method: 提出两种方法：卷积神经网络（CNN）和UNet架构，利用带外信息进行信道估计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法在频谱效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 利用带外信息的深度学习方法可有效提升毫米波MIMO信道估计性能。

Abstract: Future wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems will integrate
both sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands to meet the growing
demands for high data rates. MIMO link establishment typically requires
accurate channel estimation, which is particularly challenging at mmWave
frequencies due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we
propose two novel deep learning-based methods for estimating mmWave MIMO
channels by leveraging out-of-band information from the sub-6 GHz band. The
first method employs a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the second
method utilizes a UNet architecture. We compare these proposed methods against
deep-learning methods that rely solely on in-band information and with other
state-of-the-art out-of-band aided methods. Simulation results show that our
proposed out-of-band aided deep-learning methods outperform existing
alternatives in terms of achievable spectral efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于可移动天线（MA）阵列的基站资源分配设计，旨在通过联合优化波束成形和天线位置，最大化多用户下行非正交多址（NOMA）系统的总速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可移动天线因其能主动重构无线信道的特性受到关注，本文旨在探索其在NOMA系统中的性能提升潜力。

Method: 采用逐次凸逼近（SCA）和交替优化方法解决高度非凸的优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，MA增强的NOMA系统在总速率上显著优于固定天线（FPA）系统和传统正交多址（OMA）系统。

Conclusion: MA技术能有效提升NOMA系统的性能，为未来无线通信提供新思路。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has gained increasing attention in the field of wireless
communications due to its exceptional capability to proactively reconfigure
wireless channels via localized antenna movements. In this paper, we
investigate the resource allocation design for an MA array-enabled base station
serving multiple single-antenna users in a downlink non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) system. We aim to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly
optimizing the transmit beamforming and the positions of all MAs at the BS,
subject to the constraints of transmit power budget, finite antenna moving
region, and the conditions for successive interference cancellation decoding
rate. The formulated problem, inherently highly non-convex, is addressed by
successive convex approximation (SCA) and alternating optimization methods to
obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results unveil that the
proposed MA-enhanced downlink NOMA system can significantly improve the sum
rate performance compared to both the fixed-position antenna (FPA) system and
the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system.

*Priyanka Maity,Suraj Srivastava,Aditya K. Jagannatham,Lajos Hanzo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏贝叶斯学习（SBL）的双基地毫米波MIMO雷达目标定位方法，用于未知杂波环境下的目标参数估计，并通过超分辨率改进离网格SBL框架提升估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在双基地毫米波MIMO雷达系统中，目标参数（如AoD、AoA和速度）的精确估计面临未知杂波和有限分辨率网格的挑战，需要一种高效且鲁棒的方法。

Method: 利用角度-多普勒（AD）域的三维稀疏性，结合SBL框架进行目标参数估计，并开发了超分辨率改进的离网格SBL框架以递归更新参数网格。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法在性能上优于现有算法，并能接近推导的Cramér-Rao界（CRB）和贝叶斯CRB。

Conclusion: 该方法在目标参数估计中表现出色，尤其在处理离网格问题和未知杂波时具有显著优势。

Abstract: Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-aided target localization is conceived for a
bistatic mmWave MIMO radar system in the presence of unknown clutter, followed
by the development of an angle-Doppler (AD)-domain representation of the
target-plus-clutter echo model for accurate target parameter estimation. The
proposed algorithm exploits the three-dimensional (3D) sparsity arising in the
AD domain of the scattering scene and employs the powerful SBL framework for
the estimation of target parameters, such as the angle-of-departure (AoD),
angle-of-arrival (AoA) and velocity. To handle a practical scenario where the
actual target parameters typically deviate from their finite-resolution grid, a
super-resolution-based improved off-grid SBL framework is developed for
recursively updating the parameter grid, thereby progressively refining the
estimates. We also determine the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) and Bayesian CRB for
target parameter estimation in order to benchmark the estimation performance.
Our simulation results corroborate the superior performance of the proposed
approach in comparison to the existing algorithms, and also their ability to
approach the bounds derived.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于毫米波Wi-Fi的无设备定位方法MMWiLoc，并发布了一个多传感器数据集，用于室内定位研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波Wi-Fi在无设备感知中具有潜力，但缺乏定位方法，因此需要开发高效且精确的定位技术。

Method: MMWiLoc结合了波束模式校准（使用期望最大化）和目标定位（通过多尺度压缩感知），利用波束信噪比信息确定目标到达角。

Result: MMWiLoc实现了厘米级精度，优于2.4GHz Wi-Fi系统，与高精度雷达系统性能相当。

Conclusion: MMWiLoc为毫米波Wi-Fi定位提供了高效解决方案，并公开数据集以促进可重复研究。

Abstract: Device-free Wi-Fi sensing has numerous benefits in practical settings, as it
eliminates the requirement for dedicated sensing devices and can be
accomplished using current low-cost Wi-Fi devices. With the development of
Wi-Fi standards, millimeter wave Wi-Fi devices with 60GHz operating frequency
and up to 4GHz bandwidth have become commercially available. Although
millimeter wave Wi-Fi presents great promise for Device-Free Wi-Fi sensing with
increased bandwidth and beam-forming ability, there still lacks a method for
localization using millimeter wave Wi-Fi. Here, we present two major
contributions: First, we provide a comprehensive multi-sensor dataset that
synchronously captures human movement data from millimeter wave Wi-Fi, 2.4GHz
Wi-Fi, and millimeter wave radar sensors. This dataset enables direct
performance comparisons across different sensing modalities and facilitates
reproducible researches in indoor localization. Second, we introduce MMWiLoc, a
novel localization method that achieves centimeter-level precision with low
computational cost. MMWiLoc incorporates two components: beam pattern
calibration using Expectation Maximization and target localization through
Multi-Scale Compression Sensing. The system processes beam Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (beamSNR) information from the beam-forming process to determine target
Angle of Arrival (AoA), which is then fused across devices for localization.
Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that MMWiLoc achieves centimeter-level
precision, outperforming 2.4GHz Wi-Fi systems while maintaining competitive
performance with high-precision radar systems. The dataset and examples
processing code will be released after this paper is accepted at

Result: 研究发现，STAR-RIS能够显著提升能量效率，且在码字长度较短和最大可容忍误码率较低时效果更佳。

Conclusion: STAR-RIS在具有更严格延迟和可靠性要求的系统中更具能源效率优势。

Abstract: Energy-efficient designs are proposed for multi-user (MU) multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels (BC), assisted by simultaneously
transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)
operating at finite block length (FBL). In particular, we maximize the sum
energy efficiency (EE), showing that STAR-RIS can substantially enhance it. Our
findings demonstrate that the gains of employing STAR-RIS increase when the
codeword length and the maximum tolerable bit error rate decrease, meaning that
a STAR-RIS is more energy efficient in a system with more stringent latency and
reliability requirements.

Abstract: Reconstructing physical field tensors from \textit{in situ} observations,
such as radio maps and ocean sound speed fields, is crucial for enabling
environment-aware decision making in various applications, e.g., wireless
communications and underwater acoustics. Field data reconstruction is often
challenging, due to the limited and noisy nature of the observations,
necessitating the incorporation of prior information to aid the reconstruction
process. Deep neural network-based data-driven structural constraints (e.g.,
``deeply learned priors'') have showed promising performance. However, this
family of techniques faces challenges such as model mismatches between training
and testing phases. This work introduces FieldFormer, a self-supervised neural
prior learned solely from the limited {\it in situ} observations without the
need of offline training. Specifically, the proposed framework starts with
modeling the fields of interest using the tensor Tucker model of a high
multilinear rank, which ensures a universal approximation property for all
fields. In the sequel, an attention mechanism is incorporated to learn the
sparsity pattern that underlies the core tensor in order to reduce the solution
space.
  In this way, a ``complexity-adaptive'' neural representation, grounded in the
Tucker decomposition, is obtained that can flexibly represent
  various types of fields. A theoretical analysis is provided to support the
recoverability of the proposed design. Moreover, extensive experiments, using
various physical field tensors, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卡尔曼滤波的递归神经网络Recursive KalmanNet，用于在非高斯噪声条件下实现准确的状态估计和误差协方差量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的随机动态系统往往不符合卡尔曼滤波的线性高斯假设，需要数据驱动的滤波技术。

Method: 采用递归Joseph公式传播误差协方差，并优化高斯负对数似然。

Result: 实验表明，Recursive KalmanNet在非高斯测量白噪声下优于传统卡尔曼滤波和现有深度学习估计器。

Conclusion: Recursive KalmanNet为复杂噪声条件下的状态估计提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: State estimation in stochastic dynamical systems with noisy measurements is a
challenge. While the Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with
independent Gaussian white noise, real-world conditions often deviate from
these assumptions, prompting the rise of data-driven filtering techniques. This
paper introduces Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed recurrent neural
network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance
quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive
Joseph's formula and optimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood.
Experiments with non-Gaussian measurement white noise demonstrate that our
model outperforms both the conventional Kalman filter and an existing
state-of-the-art deep learning based estimator.

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which
complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a
diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based
anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited
generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional
evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the
reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate
inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification
using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average
$W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method
by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability,
supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy
and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method
enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG
monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and
wearable ECG applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates robust transmit (TX) beamforming from the satellite
to user terminals (UTs), based on statistical channel state information (CSI).
The proposed design specifically targets the mitigation of
satellite-to-terrestrial interference in spectrum-sharing integrated
terrestrial and satellite networks. By leveraging the distribution information
of terrestrial UTs, we first establish an interference model from the satellite
to terrestrial systems without shared CSI. Based on this, robust TX beamforming
schemes are developed under both the interference threshold and the power
budget. Two optimization criteria are considered: satellite weighted sum rate
maximization and mean square error minimization. The former achieves a superior
achievable rate performance through an iterative optimization framework,
whereas the latter enables a low-complexity closed-form solution at the expense
of reduced rate, with interference constraints satisfied via a bisection
method. To avoid complex integral calculations and the dependence on user
distribution information in inter-system interference evaluations, we propose a
terrestrial base station position-aided approximation method, and the
approximation errors are subsequently analyzed. Numerical simulations validate
the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.

Abstract: With the growing number of users in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) systems, demodulation reference signals (DMRSs) are efficiently
multiplexed in the code domain via orthogonal cover codes (OCC) to ensure
orthogonality and minimize pilot interference. In this paper, we investigate
uplink DMRS-based channel estimation for MU-MIMO systems with Type II OCC
pattern standardized in 3GPP Release 18, leveraging location-specific
statistical channel state information (SCSI) to enhance performance.
Specifically, we propose a SCSI-assisted Bayesian channel estimator (SA-BCE)
based on the minimum mean square error criterion to suppress the pilot
interference and noise, albeit at the cost of cubic computational complexity
due to matrix inversions. To reduce this complexity while maintaining
performance, we extend the scheme to a windowed version (SA-WBCE), which
incorporates antenna-frequency domain windowing and beam-delay domain
processing to exploit asymptotic sparsity and mitigate energy leakage in
practical systems. To avoid the frequent real-time SCSI acquisition, we
construct a grid-based location-specific SCSI database based on the principle
of spatial consistency, and subsequently leverage the uplink received signals
within each grid to extract the SCSI. Facilitated by the multilinear structure
of wireless channels, we formulate the SCSI acquisition problem within each
grid as a tensor decomposition problem, where the factor matrices are
parameterized by the multi-path powers, delays, and angles. The computational
complexity of SCSI acquisition can be significantly reduced by exploiting the
Vandermonde structure of the factor matrices. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed location-specific SCSI database construction method achieves
high accuracy, while the SA-BCE and SA-WBCE significantly outperform
state-of-the-art benchmarks in MU-MIMO systems.
