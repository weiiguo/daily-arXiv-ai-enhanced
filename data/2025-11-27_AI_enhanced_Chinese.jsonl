During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "WiRainbow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5929\u7ebf\u7684Wi-Fi\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9891\u7387\u626b\u63cf\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u8272\u6563\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u3002WiRainbow\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5355\u5929\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8026\u5408\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u67b6\u6784\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u9891\u7387\u626b\u63cf\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u7a84\u89c6\u573a\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5f84\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cWiRainbow\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u5404\u79cdWi-Fi\u611f\u77e5\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "WiRainbow\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u5929\u7ebfWi-Fi\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical.

The paper goes on to compare the different modified thermistors behavior with their regular counterpart and highlights the challenges and improvement areas needed for such a modified thermistor for outdoor temperature monitoring in a prosthetic system. Initial results show that some of the modified thermistors showed better temperature recording compared to the rest.

Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability.

Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u9525\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743L1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9635\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c113D\u8d85\u58f0\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u9053\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u5bfb\u57402D\u9635\u5217\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9635\u5217\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u9635\u5217\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e8c\u9636\u9525\u89c4\u5212(SOCP)\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u52a0\u6743L1\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u51c6\u5e73\u5766\u65c1\u74e3\u76842D\u7a00\u758f\u9635\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Q-Flats\u9635\u5217\u5177\u6709252\u4e2a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u65c1\u74e3\u7535\u5e73\u4e0d\u9ad8\u4e8e-21.26 dB\u3002\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u9635\u5217\u3001\u8d39\u9a6c\u87ba\u65cb\u9635\u5217\u548c\u9525\u5f62\u87ba\u65cb\u9635\u5217\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cQ-Flats\u5728\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u87ba\u65cb\u9635\u5217\u7ea63%\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u7565\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u52a0\u6743L1 SOCP\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5355\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5bfb\u6c42\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations.

We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eOFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u76f2\u76f8\u4f4d\u611f\u77e5EM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u636e\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3EM\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5927\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u76f2EM\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f2\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5927\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528PSK\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u7801\u5728EM\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u4f4d\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u4f4d\u611f\u77e5EM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u6536\u655b\u7387\u4ece80%\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u63a5\u8fd10%\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5728EM\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u7528\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u540e\u7eedturbo\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u989d\u5916\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u4f4d\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u76f2\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The framework begins by applying a balanced clustering mechanism that groups users based on the similarity of their semantic characteristics, enabling the extraction of group-level common features and user-specific private features. The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space.

To address this, LoRa technology known for its long-range capability and low power consumption is integrated with an ESP32 responsible for capturing, processing, and sending messages.\n  The LoRa DXLR01 module, which operates in the 433 MHz band, is configured with parameters aimed at maximising both transmission range and efficient energy usage. Messages are sent using Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, improving signal penetration in obstructed areas and reducing the likelihood of errors. On the receiving end, the ESP32 interprets the data and displays it on an LCD screen. Additionally, the received information is sent to the ThingSpeak platform, allowing remote storage and visualisation without relying on conventional network infrastructure.\n  Tests conducted in a controlled environment show an average latency of 3.2 seconds for text transmission.

Existing analyses often rely on Gaussian approximations and overlook fading effects, which limits their accuracy. This paper presents an accurate analytical framework for optimal bit detection in TNC systems under Rician fading. Using chi-squared statistics, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood detection threshold and an expression for the bit error probability (BEP) via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The proposed model eliminates approximation errors and accurately characterizes performance for finite sample sizes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the analytical results and demonstrate significant improvements in BEP compared with suboptimal Gaussian-based detection. Furthermore, the influence of key parameters, sample size, resistance ratio, and Rician K-factor, is quantified. The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for designing energy-efficient TNC receivers in future B5G/6G and large-scale IoT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728Rician\u8870\u843d\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6bd4\u7279\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5361\u65b9\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u68c0\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\u548c\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u4fe1\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u8870\u843d\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u652f\u6301B5G/6G\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5361\u65b9\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u68c0\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Gauss-Laguerre\u6c42\u79ef\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u9ad8\u65af\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765B5G/6G\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u80fd\u6548\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u4fe1\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
