### [1] [An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15045)
*Homa Nikbakht,Yonina C. Eldar,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于双基地MIMO的ISAC系统，用于检测和优先处理URLLC消息，通过DPC技术减少干扰，并在有限块长度（FBL）下优化速率-可靠性-检测的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中，ISAC技术被寄望于实现联合感知与通信，支持智能城市和自动驾驶等应用。这些应用需要URLLC，因此设计一个支持URLLC的ISAC系统至关重要。

Method: 提出双基地MIMO ISAC系统，利用DPC技术减少eMBB和感知信号的干扰，并通过两种方法（噪声处理和干扰消除）解码eMBB消息。

Result: 数值分析表明，提出的DPC-based ISAC方案在满足URLLC和感知约束的同时，显著提高了eMBB传输速率，优于功率共享和时间共享方案。

Conclusion: 该方案为6G网络中ISAC和URLLC的联合优化提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as
a key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and
communication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs
facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving.
Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication
(URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive
targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability
constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of
URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station
(BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is
deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS
regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to
the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a
target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional
URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper
coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and
sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for
handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive
interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the
rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by
evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of
the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our
numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly
outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular,
it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and
sensing constraints.

### [2] [MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers: Capacity-Achieving Architectures with Reduced Circuit Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15052)
*Matteo Nerini,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图论的微波线性模拟计算机（MiLAC）模型，设计了低复杂度的stem-connected MiLAC架构，显著降低了电路复杂度，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足未来无线网络需求，需从大规模MIMO扩展到巨型MIMO，但传统全连接MiLAC的电路复杂度高，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出图论模型设计stem-connected MiLAC架构，并通过闭式解优化其性能。

Result: 理论分析和数值模拟表明，stem-connected MiLAC在保持性能的同时，电路复杂度线性增长。

Conclusion: stem-connected MiLAC为高性能、可扩展的巨型MIMO提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: To meet the demands of future wireless networks, antenna arrays must scale
from massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to gigantic MIMO, involving
even larger numbers of antennas. To address the hardware and computational cost
of gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from
the digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers
(MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming
through reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on
fully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via
tunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving,
their circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components,
scales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality.
To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of
MiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC
architectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a
family of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while
drastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize
stem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our
theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that
stem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that
scales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance,
scalable, gigantic MIMO.

### [3] [Linear and Numerical SDoF Bounds of Active RIS-Assisted MIMO Wiretap Interference Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15073)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了RIS辅助的MIMO窃听干扰信道的安全自由度（SDoF），提出了基于线性波束成形和数值方法的上下界，并通过仿真验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RIS辅助的MIMO窃听干扰信道的SDoF，填补了该领域的研究空白，并具有实际应用价值。

Method: 通过线性整数规划和核范数最小化问题，分别推导了SDoF的下界和上界，并设计了RIS元素分配方案。

Result: 仿真结果表明，提出的下界优于现有基准，且上下界在许多天线配置下一致。

Conclusion: 本文为RIS辅助的MIMO窃听干扰信道的SDoF提供了理论分析和实用解决方案。

Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap interference channel (IC)
serves as a canonical model for information-theoretic security, where a
multiple-antenna eavesdropper attempts to intercept communications in a
two-user MIMO IC system. The secure degrees-of-freedom (SDoF) of an active
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted MIMO wiretap IC is with
practical interests but remains unexplored. In this paper, we establish both
sum-SDoF lower and upper bounds through linear beamforming conditions and
numerical methods. Specifically, our proposed lower bound is derived from
transmission scheme design and corresponding solutions to the sum-SDoF
maximization problem, formulated by linear integer programming. The solutions
to this optimization problem addresses RIS element allocation for leakage and
interference cancellation. The proposed upper bound is obtained by solving a
nuclear norm minimization problem, leveraging the fact that nuclear norm serves
as a convex relaxation of the rank function. For symmetry antenna
configurations, we derive a closed-form lower bound. Extensive numerical
simulations show that our proposed lower and upper bounds coincide across many
antenna configurations, and our proposed lower bound outperforms the existing
benchmark.

Result: 构造的标志码支持多种距离值，包括最大距离和次大距离，并提供了高效的解码算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为标志码的构造和解码提供了新的思路，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Flag codes are a class of multishot network codes comprising sequences of
nested subspaces (flags) within the vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, where $q$ is
a prime power. In this paper, we propose a family of constructions for full
flag codes based on partial spreads. The distances of this family include
maximum distance (optimum distance flag codes), second-maximum distance
(quasi-optimum distance flag codes), as well as other feasible values. The
structure of these flag codes resembles that of a \textquotedblleft sandwich",
consisting of one layer of companion matrix and two layers of partial spreads.
Furthermore, we present an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes.

### [5] [LLM Agent for Hyper-Parameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15167)
*Wanzhe Wang,Jianqiu Peng,Menghao Hu,Weihuang Zhong,Tong Zhang,Shuai Wang,Yixin Zhang,Mingjie Shao,Wanli Ni*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进WS-PSO-CM算法在无人机通信中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前WS-PSO-CM算法的超参数调优方法依赖启发式，自动化程度低且性能不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一个LLM代理，通过迭代框架和模型上下文协议（MCP）自动调优超参数，代理根据任务背景和输出格式驱动WS-PSO-CM算法进行探索。

Result: 实验表明，LLM代理生成的超参数在最小和速率上显著优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: LLM代理结合PSO知识和WS-PSO-CM算法背景，能有效找到高性能超参数。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

### [6] [In-Context Learning for Gradient-Free Receiver Adaptation: Principles, Applications, and Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15176)
*Matteo Zecchin,Tomer Raviv,Dileep Kalathil,Krishna Narayanan,Nir Shlezinger,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在无线接收器自适应方面存在灵活性不足或需要显式优化的问题，ICL提供了一种新的解决方案。

Method: 利用Transformer模型和结构化状态空间模型（SSMs）的架构框架，结合理论分析，探索ICL在无线接收器自适应中的应用。

Result: 研究表明，ICL是一种高效且原理性的方法，能够通过导频信号和上下文信息实现实时自适应。

Conclusion: ICL为无线接收器的动态适应提供了一种无需在线训练的可行方案，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.

### [7] [New Bounds and Constructions for Variable Packet-Error Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15233)
*Xiangliang Kong,Xin Wang,Ron M. Roth,Itzhak Tamo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了可变包错误编码问题，提出了动态纠错能力的编码设计，并给出了两种具体构造方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络通信中多路径传输时动态变化的错误数量问题。

Method: 提出了两种构造方法：一种是基于高阶MDS码，另一种是基于重复码的变体。

Result: 第一种方法在一般参数范围内优于已知结果；第二种方法在某些参数范围内达到最优率-失真权衡。

Conclusion: 本文为可变包错误编码提供了理论界限和实际构造方案，展示了在不同参数范围内的性能优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of variable packet-error coding, which
emerges in network communication scenarios where a source transmits information
to a destination through multiple disjoint paths. The objective is to design
codes with dynamic error-correcting capabilities that adapt to varying numbers
of errors. Specifically, we first provide several bounds on the
rate--distortion trade-off for general variable packet-error coding schemes.
Then, we present two explicit constructions of variable packet-error coding
schemes. The first construction uses higher-order MDS codes and provides a
coding scheme that achieves a better rate--distortion trade-off compared to
known results for general parameter regimes. The second construction is based
on a variant of the repetition code and yields a coding scheme with an optimal
rate--distortion trade-off, with respect to our bound, for certain parameter
regimes.

### [8] [Golden Partition Zone: Rethinking Neural Network Partitioning Under Inversion Threats in Collaborative Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15412)
*Rongke Liu,Youwen Zhu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何在协作推理中通过模型分割和标签平滑增强对模型反转攻击（MIA）的抵抗性，同时最小化准确率损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法集中于浅层保护，但常导致显著的效用损失，因此需要探索如何分割边缘-云模型以平衡MIA抵抗力和准确性。

Method: 通过理论分析揭示神经网络中表征转换对条件熵的影响，实验验证在表征转换或决策层分割能显著增强MIA抵抗力，并结合标签平滑进一步压缩类内方差。

Result: 实验表明，在表征转换或决策层分割使均方误差增加四倍以上，标签平滑进一步提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 决策层特征在增强反转模型下仍具韧性，辅助数据类型影响转换边界和重建行为。

Abstract: In collaborative inference, intermediate features transmitted from edge
devices can be exploited by adversaries to reconstruct original inputs via
model inversion attacks (MIA). While existing defenses focus on shallow-layer
protection, they often incur significant utility loss. A key open question is
how to partition the edge-cloud model to maximize resistance to MIA while
minimizing accuracy degradation. We first show that increasing model depth
alone does not guarantee resistance. Through theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that representational transitions in neural networks cause sharp
changes in conditional entropy $H(x\mid z)$, with intra-class variance (denoted
$R_c^2$) and feature dimensionality as critical factors. Experiments on three
representative deep vision models demonstrate that splitting at the
representational-transition or decision-level layers increases mean squared
error by more than four times compared to shallow splits, indicating
significantly stronger resistance to MIA. Positive label smoothing further
enhances robustness by compressing $R_c^2$ and improving generalization.
Finally, we validate the resilience of decision-level features under enhanced
inversion models and observe that the type of auxiliary data influences both
transition boundaries and reconstruction behavior.

### [9] [Towards Weight Distribution-Aware Polar Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15467)
*Mohammad Rowshan,Vlad-Florin Dragoi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在不使用预变换的情况下，通过权重贡献偏序设计具有更好权重分布的类极坐标码的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极坐标码的信息论构造方法导致权重分布较差，现有方法如CRC极坐标码和PAC码通过预变换改善这一问题，但本文希望在不使用预变换的情况下优化权重分布。

Method: 基于权重贡献偏序设计类极坐标码，避免使用搜索或优化算法。

Result: 数值结果显示，该方法在多种码（包括使用和不使用预变换的码）上均表现出改进。

Conclusion: 通过权重贡献偏序设计类极坐标码，可以在不依赖预变换的情况下改善权重分布。

Abstract: Polar codes are constructed based on the reliability of sub-channels
resulting from the polarization effect. However, this information-theoretic
construction approach leads to a poor weight distribution. To address this
issue, pre-transformed polar codes, such as CRC-polar codes and PAC codes, have
been employed. In this paper, we focus on the structure of polar codes without
applying any pre-transformations and explore methods, guided by the
weight-contribution partial order, to design polar-like codes with enhanced
weight distribution, notably without employing any search or optimization
algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate improvement over a range of codes
both with and without pre-transformation.

### [10] [Demonstrating Superresolution in Radar Range Estimation Using a Denoising Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14906)
*Robert Czupryniak,Abhishek Chakraborty,Andrew N. Jordan,John C. Howell*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文利用机器学习方法实现雷达遥感中的距离超分辨率，通过去噪自编码器估计亚波长区域内两个散射体的距离，并验证了不同信号设计对结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决雷达遥感中距离分辨率受限于带宽的问题，探索机器学习方法在超分辨率中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用去噪自编码器，训练数据为带限约束下的波形，优化亚波长距离的精度。分析了三种脉冲信号（sinc、三角波、Bessel）的性能。

Result: Bessel信号表现最佳，三角波次之，sinc信号最差，表明信号设计对机器学习方法的分辨率至关重要。自编码器瓶颈层与散射体间距强相关。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法在超分辨率中具有潜力，信号设计是关键因素。Bessel信号为最优选择，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: We apply machine learning methods to demonstrate range superresolution in
remote sensing radar detection. Specifically, we implement a denoising
autoencoder to estimate the distance between two equal intensity scatterers in
the subwavelength regime. The machine learning models are trained on waveforms
subject to a bandlimit constraint such that ranges much smaller than the
inverse bandlimit are optimized in their precision. The autoencoder achieves
effective dimensionality reduction, with the bottleneck layer exhibiting a
strong and consistent correlation with the true scatterer separation. We
confirm reproducibility across different training sessions and network
initializations by analyzing the scaled encoder outputs and their robustness to
noise. We investigate the behavior of the bottleneck layer for the following
types of pulses: a traditional sinc pulse, a bandlimited triangle-type pulse,
and a theoretically near-optimal pulse created from a spherical Bessel function
basis. The Bessel signal performs best, followed by the triangle wave, with the
sinc signal performing worst, highlighting the crucial role of signal design in
the success of machine-learning-based range resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展DD框架到MIMO系统，尤其是在RIS和SIM增强的环境中，是一个未解决的挑战。

Result: 模型展示了在SIM辅助无线系统中增强波形性能的潜力。

Conclusion: MPDD模型为RIS和SIM增强的MIMO系统提供了新的信道建模方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The doubly-dispersive (DD) channel structure has played a pivotal role in
wireless communications, particularly in high-mobility scenarios and integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC), due to its ability to capture the key fading
effects experienced by a transmitted signal as it propagates through a dynamic
medium. However, extending the DD framework to multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems, especially in environments artificially enhanced by
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and stacked intelligent metasurfaces
(SIM), remains a challenging open problem. In this chapter, a novel
metasurfaces-parametrized DD (MPDD) channel model that integrates an arbitrary
number of RISs, while also incorporating SIM at both the transmitter and
receiver is introduced. Next, the application of this model to some key
waveforms optimized for DD environments -- namely orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine
frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) -- is discussed. Finally, the
programmability of the proposed model is highlighted through an illustrative
application, demonstrating its potential for enhancing waveform performance in
SIM-assisted wireless systems.

### [12] [Secure Time-Modulated Intelligent Reflecting Surface via Generative Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14992)
*Zhihao Tao,Athina P. Petropulu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成式AI的TM-IRS参数设计方法，用于多用户OFDM系统的定向调制，显著提升了系统安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TM-IRS设计方法仅适用于单用户场景，无法满足多用户需求，亟需一种高效的多用户参数设计方法。

Method: 将TM-IRS参数选择建模为确定性MDP，利用GFlowNets学习随机策略，以概率与奖励成正比的方式采样参数集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多用户场景下有效提升系统安全性，且GFlowNets仅需训练极少量配置即可收敛。

Conclusion: 生成式AI方法为TM-IRS多用户设计提供了高效解决方案，代码开源促进可复现性。

Abstract: We propose a novel directional modulation (DM) design for OFDM transmitters
aided by a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS). The TM-IRS
is configured to preserve the integrity of transmitted signals toward multiple
legitimate users while scrambling the signal in all other directions. Existing
TM-IRS design methods typically target a single user direction and follow
predefined rule-based procedures, making them unsuitable for multi-user
scenarios. Here, we propose a generative AI-based approach to design good sets
of TM-IRS parameters out of a set of all possible quantized ranges of
parameters. The design objective is to maximize the sum rate across the
authorized directions. We model the TM-IRS parameter selection as a
deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state
corresponds to a specific configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets are
employed to learn a stochastic policy that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with
probability proportional to their associated sum rate reward. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the security
of the TM-IRS-aided OFDM systems with multi-users. Also, despite the vast size
of the TM-IRS configuration space, the GFlowNet is able to converge after
training on fewer than 0.000001% of all possible configurations, demonstrating
remarkable efficiency compared to exhaustive combinatorial search.
Implementation code is available at https://github.com/ZhihaoTao/GFN4TM-RIS to

Abstract: With the applicability of optical fiber-based distributed acoustic sensing
(DAS) systems, effective signal processing and analysis approaches are needed
to promote its popularization in the field of intelligent transportation
systems (ITS). This paper presents a signal denoising algorithm using a hybrid
deep-learning network (HDLNet). Without annotated data and time-consuming
labeling, this self-supervised network runs in parallel, combining an
autoencoder for denoising (DAE) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for
sequential processing. Additionally, a line-by-line matching algorithm for
vehicle detection and tracking is introduced, thus realizing the complete
processing of fiber signal denoising and feature extraction. Experiments were
carried out on a self-established real highway tunnel dataset, showing that our
proposed hybrid network yields more satisfactory denoising performance than
Spatial-domain DAE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多基站多用户系统中，利用OOB模态减少波束跟踪的信令开销和多基站协调的高延迟问题。

Conclusion: OMS方案有效解决了多基站多用户系统中的波束预测和协调问题，为密集部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-user millimeter-wave communication relies on narrow beams and dense
cell deployments to ensure reliable connectivity. However, tracking optimal
beams for multiple mobile users across multiple base stations (BSs) results in
significant signaling overhead. Recent works have explored the capability of
out-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless
channels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user
systems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense
cell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing
overhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to
eliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in
multi-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
OOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize
multi-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB
modalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially
identified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and
then tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence.
Subsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network
(BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for
mobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to
perform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the
proposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS
selection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the
optimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS
coordination efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Yuxuan Xia,Ángel F. García-Fernández,Johan Karlsson,Yu Ge,Lennart Svensson,Ting Yuan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种广义化的轨迹最优子模式分配（GOSPA）度量方法，用于评估提供轨迹估计的多目标跟踪算法，并考虑了轨迹级不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分处理轨迹估计中的不确定性，因此需要一种能够同时考虑存在和状态估计不确定性的度量方法。

Method: 基于概率GOSPA度量，将其扩展为多维分配问题，并通过线性规划松弛实现多项式时间计算。

Result: 该度量保留了TGOSPA的可解释性，并能分解为直观的成本项，如定位误差、存在概率不匹配误差等。仿真研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的度量方法在评估多目标跟踪算法时具有更好的适应性和解释性。

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal
sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking
algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties.
This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to
account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual
object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a
multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming
relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time.
Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show
that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected
localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly
detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch
error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a
simulation study.

Abstract: The vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to signal
interference have increased the demand for complementary positioning,
navigation, and timing (PNT) systems. To address this, South Korea has decided
to deploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system as a complementary
PNT solution. Similar to GNSS, eLoran provides highly accurate timing
information, which is essential for applications such as telecommunications,
financial systems, and power distribution. However, the primary sources of
error for GNSS and eLoran differ. For eLoran, the main source of error is
signal propagation delay over land, known as the additional secondary factor
(ASF). This delay, influenced by ground conductivity and weather conditions
along the signal path, is challenging to predict and mitigate. In this paper,
we measure the time difference (TD) between GPS and eLoran using a time
interval counter and analyze the correlations between eLoran/GPS TD and eleven
meteorological factors. Accurate estimation of eLoran/GPS TD could enable
eLoran to achieve timing accuracy comparable to that of GPS. We propose two
estimation models for eLoran/GPS TD and compare their performance with existing
TD estimation methods. The proposed WLR-AGRNN model captures the linear
relationships between meteorological factors and eLoran/GPS TD using weighted
linear regression (WLR) and models nonlinear relationships between outputs from
expert networks through an anisotropic general regression neural network
(AGRNN). The model incorporates terrain elevation to appropriately weight
meteorological data, as elevation influences signal propagation delay.
Experimental results based on four months of data demonstrate that the
WLR-AGRNN model outperforms other models, highlighting its effectiveness in
improving eLoran/GPS TD estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: 研究为异构服务共存提供了有效的资源分配策略，强化学习方法在不同场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: Flexible and efficient wireless resource sharing across heterogeneous
services is a key objective for future wireless networks. In this context, we
investigate the performance of a system where latency-constrained
internet-of-things (IoT) devices coexist with a broadband user. The base
station adopts a grant-free access framework to manage resource allocation,
either through orthogonal radio access network (RAN) slicing or by allowing
shared access between services. For the IoT users, we propose a reinforcement
learning (RL) approach based on double Q-Learning (QL) to optimise their
repetition-based transmission strategy, allowing them to adapt to varying
levels of interference and meet a predefined latency target. We evaluate the
system's performance in terms of the cumulative distribution function of IoT
users' latency, as well as the broadband user's throughput and energy
efficiency (EE). Our results show that the proposed RL-based access policies
significantly enhance the latency performance of IoT users in both RAN Slicing
and RAN Sharing scenarios, while preserving desirable broadband throughput and
EE. Furthermore, the proposed policies enable RAN Sharing to be
energy-efficient at low IoT traffic levels, and RAN Slicing to be favourable
under high IoT traffic.

Abstract: This paper studies a high-altitude platform (HAP) network supported by
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The practical irregular placement
of HAPs and RISs is modeled using homogeneous Poisson point processes, while
buildings that cause blockages in urban areas are modeled as a Boolean scheme
of rectangles. We introduce a novel approach to characterize the statistical
channel based on generalized Beta prime distribution. Analytical expressions
for coverage probability and ergodic capacity in an interference-limited system
are derived and validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings show
notable performance improvements and reveal the impact of various system
parameters, including blockages effect which contribute in mitigating
interference from the other visible HAPs. This proposed system could enhance
connectivity and enable effective data offloading in urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是数据采集中的关键环节，但其对一维一阶差分麦克风阵列性能的影响尚未被研究。

Method: 提出了一维一阶差分麦克风阵列量化波束形成的解析表达式，并通过仿真分析了量化对波束图、DF、FBR和ND的影响。

Result: 量化主要影响ND，且ND随量化位数增加而改善；波束形状、DF和FBR不受量化位数影响；ND与频率无关，但随零位靠近主方向而降低。

Conclusion: 量化对差分麦克风阵列性能的影响集中在ND，优化量化位数可提升干扰抑制能力。

Abstract: In practical systems, recorded analog signals must be digitized for
processing, introducing quantization as a critical aspect of data acquisition.
While prior studies have examined quantization effects in various signal
processing contexts, its impact on differential microphone arrays (DMAs),
particularly in one-dimensional (1D) first-order configurations, remains
unexplored. This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on
performance of first-order 1D DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical
expression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D DMA has been
formulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array
performance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF),
Front-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and null depth (ND). Simulation results reveal that
beampattern shape remains structurally invariant across quantization bit
depths, with quantization primarily affecting ND. DF and FBR remain constant
with the varying number of quantization bits. Additionally, ND is shown to be
frequency-independent; however, it increases with increasing quantization bit
depths, enhancing interference suppression. The study also examines the effect
of steering nulls across the azimuthal range, showing that ND degrades as the
null moves closer to the source look direction, indicating reduced interference
suppression.

TL;DR: 论文研究了高频段大规模天线阵列的近场波束聚焦，推导了广义均匀矩形阵列（URA）的波束深度，并探讨了阵列几何形状对近场波束聚焦的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来无线通信系统可能在高频段大规模天线阵列的近场区域运行，近场波束聚焦可实现空间复用，但阵列几何形状对其性能的影响尚不明确。

Method: 论文定义了广义URA的有效波束聚焦瑞利距离（EBRD），分析了不同几何形状的URA对波束深度和EBRD的影响。

Result: 方形URA的波束深度最窄，但EBRD受限；宽或高的URA能最大化EBRD，仿真显示其多用户和速率是方形URA的3.5倍。

Conclusion: 宽或高的URA在近场波束聚焦中表现更优，因其扩展的EBRD和更强的空间复用能力。

Abstract: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequency bands, future
wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative
near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused
within a spatial region of finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in both
the angular and range dimensions. This paper derives the beamdepth for a
generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry
influences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field
beamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of
beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective
beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis
reveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is
maximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a
square URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely
constrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a
sum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended
EBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities.
