Yet, the joint design of the base station precoding matrix as well as the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficient matrices leads to a high-dimensional, strongly nonconvex, and NP-hard optimization problem. Conventional alternating optimization (AO) schemes typically involve repeated large-scale matrix inversion operations, resulting in high computational complexity and poor scalability, while existing deep learning approaches often rely on expensive pre-training and large network models. In this paper, we develop a gradient-based meta learning (GML) framework that directly feeds optimization gradients into lightweight neural networks, thereby removing the need for pre-training and enabling fast adaptation. Specifically, we design dedicated GML-based schemes for both independent-phase and coupled-phase STAR-RIS models, effectively handling their respective amplitude and phase constraints while achieving weighted sum-rate performance very close to that of AO-based benchmarks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for both phase models, the proposed methods substantially reduce computational overhead, with complexity growing nearly linearly when the number of BS antennas and STAR-RIS elements grows, and yielding up to 10 times runtime speedup over AO, which confirms the scalability and practicality of the proposed GML method for large-scale STAR-RIS-assisted communications."}

We develop a deep-learning surrogate for a three-dimensional duct MC channel with reactive diffusion-advection transport and reversible ligand-receptor binding on a finite ring receiver. Using a physics-based partial differential equation (PDE)-ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, we generate a large CIR dataset across broad transport, reaction, and geometric ranges and train a neural network that maps these parameters directly to the CIR. On an independent test set, the surrogate closely matches reference CIRs both qualitatively and quantitatively: the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) shows that 90% of test channels are predicted with error below 0.15, with only weak dependence on individual parameters. The surrogate therefore offers an accurate and computationally efficient replacement for repeated PDE-based CIR evaluations in MC system analysis and design."}

We therefore propose a user positioning and monitoring system that infers locations from spatial intensity measurements on a photodetector (PD) array. Specifically, our hybrid approach couples an optics-informed forward model and sparse, model-based inversion with a lightweight data-driven calibration stage, yielding high accuracy at low computational cost. This design preserves the interpretability and stability of model-based reconstruction while leveraging learning to absorb residual nonidealities and device-specific distortions. Under identical hardware and training conditions (both with 5 x 10^5 samples), the hybrid method attains consistently lower mean-squared error than a generic deep-learning baseline while using substantially less training time and compute. Accuracy improves with array resolution and saturates around 60 x 60-80 x 80, indicating a favorable accuracy-complexity trade-off for real-time deployment.

Amplitude-phase-time block modulation (APTBM) has recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem. By leveraging the intrinsic amplitude and phase constraints of each APTBM block, PA-induced nonlinear distortion can be mitigated through constraint-guided signal reconstruction. However, existing reconstruction methods apply these constraints only heuristically and statistically, limiting the achievable IBO reduction and PA efficiency improvement. This paper addresses this limitation by decomposing the nonlinear distortion into dominant and residual components, and accordingly develops a novel two-stage signal reconstruction algorithm consisting of coarse and fine reconstruction stages. The coarse reconstruction stage eliminates the dominant distortion by jointly exploiting the APTBM block structure and PA nonlinear characteristics. The fine reconstruction stage minimizes the residual distortion by formulating a nonconvex optimization problem that explicitly enforces the APTBM constraints. To handle this problem efficiently, a low-complexity iterative variable substitution method is introduced, which relaxes the problem into a sequence of trust-region subproblems, each solvable in closed form. The proposed algorithm is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and testbed experiments. Results show that it achieves up to 4 dB IBO reduction in simulations and up to 2 dB IBO reduction in experiments while maintaining transmission performance, corresponding to PA efficiency improvements of 59.1\\% and 33.9\\%, respectively, over existing methods."}

In particular, when a transmission is complete, the update system makes a threshold-based decision on whether to wait or transmit, and if latter, which server to use for transmissions, on the basis of the instantaneous value of the age of information (AoI) process. In our setting, servers have general heterogeneous discrete phase-type (DPH) distributed service times, and also heterogeneous transmission costs. The goal is to find an age-dependent multi-threshold policy that minimizes the AoI cost with a constraint on transmission costs, the former cost defined in terms of the time average of an arbitrary function of AoI. For this purpose, we propose a novel tool called \\emph{multi-regime absorbing Markov chain} (MR-AMC) in discrete time. Using the MR-AMC framework, we exactly obtain the distribution of AoI, and subsequently the costs associated with AoI and transmissions. With the exact analysis in hand, optimum thresholds can be obtained in the case of a few servers, by exhaustive search. We validate the proposed analytical model, and also demonstrate the benefits of age-dependent server selection, with numerical examples."}

Such scenarios arise frequently in applications such as passive radar, cognitive radio, low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) radar, and planetary radar for radio astronomy, where canceling the radio frequency interference (RFI) is critical for uncovering the SOI. In this work, we examine the Demodulation-Remodulation (Demod-Remod) based interference cancellation framework for the RFI. This approach demodulates the unknown interference, creates a noise-free interference replica, and coherently subtracts it from the received signal. To evaluate the performance limits, we employ the performance metric termed \\textit{interference rejection ratio} (IRR), which quantifies the interference canceled. We derive the analytical expressions of IRR as a function of the optimal estimation variances of the signal parameters. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical expression for both single-carrier and multi-carrier interference signals and demonstrate that the method can substantially suppress the interference at a sufficient interference-to-noise ratio (INR), enabling enhanced detection and extraction of the SOI. We further extend the analysis to the scenario where the SOI is above the noise floor, and confirm the validity of the theoretical IRR expression in this scenario. Lastly, we compare the Demod-Remod technique to other time-domain cancellation methods.

To accommodate this demand with limited hardware resources, beam hopping (BH) has emerged as a prominent approach in LEO SATCOM. However, its time-domain switching mechanism confines coverage to a small fraction of the service area during each time slot, exacerbating uplink throughput bottlenecks and latency issues as the user density increases. Meanwhile, wideband systems experience the beam-squint effect, where analog beamforming (BF) directions vary with subcarrier frequencies, potentially causing misalignment at certain frequencies, thereby hindering the performance of wideband SATCOM. In this paper, we aim to shift the paradigm in wideband LEO SATCOM from beam-squint as an impairment to beam-squint as an asset. Specifically, we put forth 3D rainbow BF employing a joint phase-time array (JPTA) antenna with true time delay (TTD) to intentionally widen the beam-squint angle, steering frequency-dependent beams toward distributed directions. This novel approach enables the satellite to serve its entire coverage area in a single time slot. By doing so, the satellite simultaneously receives uplink signals from a massive number of users, significantly boosting throughput and reducing latency. To realize 3D rainbow BF, we formulate a JPTA beamformer optimization problem and address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem through a novel joint alternating and decomposition-based optimization framework. Through numerical evaluations incorporating realistic 3D LEO SATCOM geometry, our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed rainbow BF-empowered LEO SATCOM achieves up to 2.8-fold increase in uplink throughput compared to conventional BH systems. These results mark a significant breakthrough for 6G wideband LEO SATCOM."}

Although both processes originate from a common underlying phenomenon (e.g., distinct features of the same source), each monitor is interested only in its corresponding feature. A reconstruction error is incurred when the true and reconstructed states mismatch at one or both monitors. To address this problem, we propose an error-aware joint sampling and transmission policy, under which each sampler probabilistically generates samples only when the current process state differs from the most recently reconstructed state at its corresponding monitor. We adopt the time-averaged reconstruction error as the primary performance metric and benchmark the proposed policy against state-of-the-art joint sampling and transmission schemes. For each policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting time-averaged reconstruction error. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to an average sampling cost constraint. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed error-aware policy achieves the minimum time-averaged reconstruction error among the considered schemes while efficiently utilizing the sampling budget.

However, its intrinsic characteristics also pose new security challenges, notably an increased vulnerability to eavesdropping attacks. Existing studies on defending against eavesdropping attacks in DeepJSCC, while demonstrating certain effectiveness, often incur considerable computational overhead or introduce performance trade-offs that may adversely affect legitimate users. In this paper, we present DeepGuard, to the best of our knowledge, the first physical-layer defense framework for DeepJSCC against eavesdropping attacks, validated through over-the-air experiments using software-defined radios (SDRs). Considering that existing eavesdropping attacks against DeepJSCC are limited to simulation under ideal channels, we take a step further by identifying and implementing four representative types of attacks under various configurations in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems. These attacks are evaluated over-the-air under diverse scenarios, allowing us to comprehensively characterize the real-world threat landscape. To mitigate these threats, DeepGuard introduces a novel preamble perturbation mechanism that modifies the preamble shared only between legitimate transceivers. To realize it, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the perturbation's impact on the signals intercepted by the eavesdropper. Building upon this, we develop an end-to-end perturbation optimization algorithm that significantly degrades eavesdropping performance while preserving reliable communication for legitimate users.

The DM may abort an in-progress action, yielding no sample, by truncating its realized cost at a smaller, tunable deterministic limit, which we term a per-action deadline. We analyze how this cancellation option can be exploited under two cost-revelation models: ex-post, where the cost is revealed only after the sample is obtained, and ex-ante, where the cost accrues before sample acquisition.\n  In the ex-post model, per-action deadlines do not affect the expected total cost, and the cost-error tradeoffs coincide with the baseline obtained by replacing deterministic costs with cost means. In the ex-ante model, we show how per-action deadlines inflate the expected number of times actions are applied, and that the resulting expected total cost can be reduced to the constant-cost setting by introducing an effective per-action cost. We characterize when deadlines are beneficial and study several families in detail."}

Here we report a global-scale, decentralized GNSS architecture spanning hundreds of ground stations. By modeling the receiver network as a time-varying graph, we employ a deep linear neural network approach to learn topology-aware mixing schedules that optimize information exchange. This enables a gradient tracking diffusion strategy wherein stations execute local inference and exchange succinct messages to achieve two concurrent objectives: centimeter-level self-localization and network-wide consensus on satellite correction products. The consensus products are broadcast to user receivers as corrections, supporting precise point positioning (PPP) and precise point positioning-real-time kinematic (PPP-RTK). Numerical results demonstrate that our method matches the accuracy of centralized baselines while significantly outperforming existing decentralized methods in convergence speed and communication overhead. By reframing decentralized GNSS as a networked signal processing problem, our results pave the way for integrating decentralized optimization, consensus-based inference, and graph-aware learning as effective tools in operational satellite navigation."}

As data-driven models increasingly support the assessment of civil structures, the persistent challenge of transferring knowledge across varying geometries, materials, and environmental conditions remains a major obstacle. DA offers a systematic approach to mitigate these discrepancies by aligning feature distributions between simulated, laboratory, and field domains while preserving the sensitivity of damage-related information. Drawing on more than sixty representative studies, this paper analyzes the evolution of DA methods for SHM, including statistical alignment, adversarial and subdomain learning, physics-informed adaptation, and generative modeling for simulation-to-real transfer. The review summarizes their contributions and limitations across bridge and building applications, revealing that while DA has improved generalization significantly, key challenges persist: managing domain discrepancy, addressing data scarcity, enhancing model interpretability, and enabling adaptability to multiple sources and time-varying conditions. Future research directions emphasize integrating physical constraints into learning objectives, developing physics-consistent generative frameworks to enhance data realism, establishing interpretable and certifiable DA systems for engineering practice, and advancing multi-source and lifelong adaptation for scalable monitoring. Overall, this review consolidates the methodological foundation of DA for SHM, identifies existing barriers to generalization and trust, and outlines the technological trajectory toward transparent, physics-aware, and adaptive monitoring systems that support the long-term resilience of civil infrastructure."}

In this work, we adopt a realistic assumption of IRS-induced time delay for physical layer security (PLS) enhancement. We consider an indoor VLC system where an IRS is used to shape the channel so that the reflected signals add constructively at the legitimate user and create intersymbol interference at eavesdroppers located inside the coverage area. The resulting secrecy capacity maximisation over the IRS element allocation is formulated as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem and is solved using deep reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimisation (PPO). The approach is evaluated for both colluding eavesdroppers, which combine their received signals, and non-colluding eavesdroppers, which act independently. Simulation results are shown for various simulation setups, which demonstrate significant secrecy capacity gains. In a worst-case scenario, where the eavesdroppers have stronger channels than the legitimate user, the proposed PPO-based IRS allocation improves secrecy capacity by 107\\% and 235\\% in the colluding and non-colluding cases, respectively, compared with allocating all IRS elements to the legitimate user. These results demonstrate that time-delay-based IRS control can provide a strong secrecy advantage in practical indoor VLC scenarios."}

While such cooperation can substantially enhance link budgets and achievable rates, its practical realization is challenged by the scalability limitations of centralized beamforming designs and the stringent computational and signaling constraints of large LEO constellations. This paper develops a fully decentralized cooperative beamforming framework for networked LEO satellite downlinks. Using an ergodic-rate-based formulation, we first derive a centralized weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) solution as a performance benchmark. Building on this formulation, we propose a topology-agnostic decentralized beamforming algorithm by localizing the benchmark and exchanging a set of globally coupled variables whose dimensions are independent of the antenna number and enforcing consensus over arbitrary connected inter-satellite networks. The resulting algorithm admits fully parallel execution across satellites. To further enhance scalability, we eliminate the consensus-related auxiliary variables in closed form and derive a low-complexity per-satellite update rule that is optimal to local iteration and admits a quasi-closed-form solution via scalar line search. Simulation results show that the proposed decentralized schemes closely approach centralized performance under practical inter-satellite topologies, while significantly reducing computational complexity and signaling overhead, enabling scalable cooperative beamforming for large LEO constellations."}

The receiver uses a double sliding-window decoder, where the inner window employs iterative decoding with joint timing and pilot detection, channel estimation, single-user decoding, and successive interference cancellation to recover the message bits, while the outer window enhances interference cancellation. The numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme exhibits only a slight performance loss compared to the synchronous benchmark while being more applicable in practice."}

Conventional alternating optimization (AO) schemes typically involve repeated large-scale matrix inversion operations, resulting in high computational complexity and poor scalability, while existing deep learning approaches often rely on expensive pre-training and large network models. In this paper, we develop a gradient-based meta learning (GML) framework that directly feeds optimization gradients into lightweight neural networks, thereby removing the need for pre-training and enabling fast adaptation. Specifically, we design dedicated GML-based schemes for both independent-phase and coupled-phase STAR-RIS models, effectively handling their respective amplitude and phase constraints while achieving weighted sum-rate performance very close to that of AO-based benchmarks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for both phase models, the proposed methods substantially reduce computational overhead, with complexity growing nearly linearly when the number of BS antennas and STAR-RIS elements grows, and yielding up to 10 times runtime speedup over AO, which confirms the scalability and practicality of the proposed GML method for large-scale STAR-RIS-assisted communications."}

Conventional subband-based CQI approaches, due to coarse granularity, often fail to capture fine frequency-selective variations and thus lead to suboptimal resource allocation. In this paper, we propose an AI-driven subcarrier-level CQI feedback framework tailored for 6G and NextG systems. First, we introduce CQInet, an autoencoder-based scheme that compresses per-subcarrier CQI at the user equipment and reconstructs it at the base station, significantly reducing feedback overhead without compromising CQI accuracy. Simulation results show that CQInet increases the effective data rate by 7.6% relative to traditional subband CQI under equivalent feedback overhead. Building on this, we develop SR-CQInet, which leverages super-resolution to infer fine-grained subcarrier CQI from sparsely reported CSI reference signals (CSI-RS). SR-CQInet reduces CSI-RS overhead to 3.5% of CQInet's requirements while maintaining comparable throughput.

To address spectral efficiency and communication security challenges in LAE, this paper investigates secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization using intelligent sky mirrors, UAV-mounted multifunctional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) assisting nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. These aerial mirrors intelligently amplify legitimate signals while simultaneously generating jamming against eavesdroppers. We formulate a joint optimization problem encompassing UAV trajectory, base station power allocation, RIS phase shifts, amplification factors, and scheduling matrices. Given the fractional SEE objective and dynamic UAV scenarios, we propose a two-layer optimization scheme: SAC-driven first layer for trajectory and power management, and channel alignment-based second layer for phase optimization. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms benchmark approaches."}

However, conventional SEI techniques are primarily designed for single-emitter scenarios. This poses a fundamental limitation in distributed wireless networks, where simultaneous transmissions from multiple emitters result in overlapping signals that conventional single-emitter identification methods cannot effectively handle. To overcome this limitation, we present a specific multi-emitter identification (SMEI) framework via multi-label learning, treating identification as a problem of directly decoding emitter states from overlapping signals. Theoretically, we establish performance bounds using Fano's inequality. Methodologically, the multi-label formulation reduces output dimensionality from exponential to linear scale, thereby substantially decreasing computational complexity. Additionally, we propose an improved SMEI (I-SMEI), which incorporates multi-head attention to effectively capture features in correlated signal combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that SMEI achieves high identification accuracy with a linear computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed I-SMEI scheme significantly improves identification accuracy across various overlapping scenarios compared to the proposed SMEI and other advanced methods."}

The signal of each anchor is generated by transmitting a sequence of known symbols, allowing for amplitude and duration (number of symbols) to be different from anchor to anchor. The problem is the minimization of the sum of the energies of the transmitted signals imposing a constraint on the performance of the tracking procedure. Specifically, the constraint is the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound, below the mean square error achieved by any unbiased estimator. The main improvement over the previous literature is the derivation of a formula that, at each step of the tracking, allows to calculate in closed form the first-order variation of the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound as a function of the variation of the total energy. To concretely show the application of our approach, we present also two numerical algorithms that implement the constrained optimization in the case of signals of fixed amplitude and variable duration transmitted from the anchors in a time division multiplexing scheme."}

Remifentanil, an analgesic widely used during anesthesia, presents a dosing challenge due to the absence of an universally accepted indicator of analgesia. To examine how changes in patient state correlate with adjustments in remifentanil target concentration triggered by the practitioner, we analyzed data from two sources: VitalDB (Seoul, Korea) and PREDIMED (Grenoble, France). Results show that only features derived from arterial pressure are consistently associated with changes in remifentanil targets. This finding is robust across both datasets despite variations in specific thresholds. In particular, increases in remifentanil targets are associated with high or rising arterial pressure over short periods (1--2 minutes), whereas decreases are linked to low, stable, or declining arterial pressure over longer periods (5--7 minutes). By capturing anesthesiologists' dosing strategies we provide a foundation for the future development of closed-loop control algorithms. Beyond the specific example of remifentanil's change prediction, the proposed feature generation and associated sparse fitting approach can be applied to other domain where human decision can be viewed as sensors interpretation."}

In this realm, the emergence of malicious ISAC systems has amplified the need for authorized parties to legitimately monitor suspicious communication links and protect legitimate targets from potential detection or exploitation by malicious foes. In this paper, we propose a new wireless proactive monitoring paradigm, where a legitimate monitor intercepts a suspicious communication link while performing cognitive jamming to enhance the monitoring success probability (MSP) and simultaneously safeguard the target. To this end, we derive closed-form expressions of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the user (UE), sensing access points (S-APs), and an approximating expression of the SINR at the proactive monitor. Moreover, we propose an optimization technique under which the legitimate monitor minimizes the success detection probability (SDP) of the legitimate target, by optimizing the jamming power allocation over both communication and sensing channels subject to total power constraints and monitoring performance requirement. To enhance the monitor's longevity and reduce the risk of detection by malicious ISAC systems, we further propose an adaptive power allocation scheme aimed at minimizing the total transmit power at the monitor while meeting a pre-selected sensing SINR threshold and ensuring successful monitoring. Our numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly compromises the sensing and communication performance of malicious ISAC."}

Their application in real-time communication is, however, still lagging behind due to their computation-heavy nature involving multiple calls of large DNNs.\n  Here, we present Stream.FM, a frame-causal flow-based generative model with an algorithmic latency of 32 milliseconds (ms) and a total latency of 48 ms, paving the way for generative speech processing in real-time communication. We propose a buffered streaming inference scheme and an optimized DNN architecture, show how learned few-step numerical solvers can boost output quality at a fixed compute budget, explore model weight compression to find favorable points along a compute/quality tradeoff, and contribute a model variant with 24 ms total latency for the speech enhancement task.\n  Our work looks beyond theoretical latencies, showing that high-quality streaming generative speech processing can be realized on consumer GPUs available today. Stream.FM can solve a variety of speech processing tasks in a streaming fashion: speech enhancement, dereverberation, codec post-filtering, bandwidth extension, STFT phase retrieval, and Mel vocoding. As we verify through comprehensive evaluations and a MUSHRA listening test, Stream.FM establishes a state-of-the-art for generative streaming speech restoration, exhibits only a reasonable reduction in quality compared to a non-streaming variant, and outperforms our recent work (Diffusion Buffer) on generative streaming speech enhancement while operating at a lower latency."}

As a complement to terrestrial cellular networks, non-terrestrial systems enable coverage extension and reliability enhancement beyond the limits of conventional infrastructure. Currently, the high reliance on terrestrial networks exposes communications to vulnerabilities in the event of terrestrial infrastructure failures, e.g., due to natural disasters. Therefore, this work proposes the joint evaluation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for two non-terrestrial satellite networks (Starlink and OneWeb) and two terrestrial cellular networks to assess the current performance of these technologies across three different environments: (i) urban, (ii) suburban, and (iii) forest scenarios. Additionally, multi-connectivity techniques are explored to determine the benefits in connectivity when two technologies are used simultaneously. For instance, the outage probability of Starlink and OneWeb in urban areas is reduced from approximately 12-21\\% to 2\\% when both solutions are employed together. Finally, the joint analysis of KPIs in both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks demonstrates that their integration enhances coverage, improves performance, and increases reliability, highlighting the benefits of combining satellite and terrestrial systems in the analyzed environments."}

In the proposed scheme, the transmitted signal consists of a pilot sequence and a polar codeword, with the polar codeword distributed across the data part of the packet in an on-off pattern. The receiver uses a double sliding-window decoder, where the inner window employs iterative decoding with joint timing and pilot detection, channel estimation, single-user decoding, and successive interference cancellation to recover the message bits, while the outer window enhances interference cancellation. The numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme exhibits only a slight performance loss compared to the synchronous benchmark while being more applicable in practice."}
