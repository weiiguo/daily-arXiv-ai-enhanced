To\nevaluate its potential, we first conduct a comparative analysis of the received\nsignal power in point-to-point communication systems assisted by three types of\nsurfaces: (1) the proposed pattern-reconfigurable FRIS, (2) a\nposition-reconfigurable FRIS, and (3) a conventional RIS. Theoretical results\ndemonstrate that the pattern-reconfigurable FRIS provides a significant\nadvantage in modulating transmission signals compared to the other two\nconfigurations. To further study its capabilities, we extend the framework to a\nmultiuser communication scenario. In this context, the spherical harmonics\northogonal decomposition (SHOD) method is employed to accurately model the\nradiation patterns of individual fluid elements, making the pattern design\nprocess more tractable. An optimization problem is then formulated with the\nobjective of maximizing the weighted sum rate among users by jointly designing\nthe active beamforming vectors and the spherical harmonics coefficients,\nsubject to both transmit power and pattern energy constraints. To tackle the\nresulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm\nthat alternates between a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) approach for active\nbeamforming and a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method for updating the\nspherical harmonics coefficients.

Spot size -- the diameter of the incident beam's spatial\nprofile -- is one of the limiting factors for resolution, along with various\nsources of noise in the SE signal. The effect of the beam spatial profile is\ncommonly understood as convolutional. We show that under a simple and plausible\nphysical abstraction for the beam, though convolution describes the mean of the\nSE counts, the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture. We demonstrate that\nthis more detailed modeling can enable resolution improvements over\nconventional estimators through a stylized application in semiconductor\ninspection of localizing the edge in a two-valued sample. We derive Fisher\ninformation about edge location in conventional and time-resolved measurements\n(TRM) and also derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the latter.\nEmpirically, the MLE computed from TRM is approximately efficient except at\nvery low beam diameter, so Fisher information comparisons are predictive of\nperformance and can be used to optimize the beam diameter relative to the\nraster scan spacing. Monte Carlo simulations show that the MLE gives a 5-fold\nreduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization as compared to\nconventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to three real HIM\ndatasets, the average RMSE reduction factor is 5.4.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u7535\u5b50\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MLE\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e8c\u6b21\u7535\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e8c\u6b21\u7535\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08TRM\uff09\u548c\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MLE\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u8fb9\u7f18\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aMLE\u5c06\u8fb9\u7f18\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff08RMSE\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u4e865\u500d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645HIM\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e5.4\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\u548cMLE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u7535\u5b50\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}
