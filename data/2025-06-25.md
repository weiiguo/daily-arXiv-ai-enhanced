Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A method to construct and count all the linear codes (of arbitrary length) in
$\mathbb{F}_{4}$ that are invariant under reverse permutation and that contain
the repetition code is presented. These codes are suitable for constructing DNA
codes that satisfy the reverse and reverse-complement constraints. By analyzing
a module-theoretic structure of these codes, their generating matrices are
characterized in terms of their isomorphism type, and explicit formulas for
counting them are provided. The proposed construction method based on this
characterization outperforms the one given by Abualrub et al. for cyclic codes
(of odd length) over $\mathbb{F}_{4}$, and the counting method solves a problem
that can not be solved using the one given by Fripertinger for invariant
subspaces under a linear endomorphism of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$. Additionally,
several upper bounds and an identity for the minimum Hamming distance of
certain reversible codes are provided.

### [2] [Poset-Markov Channels: Capacity via Group Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19305)
*Eray Unsal Atay,Eitan Levin,Venkat Chandrasekaran,Victoria Kostina*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的通信信道形式化方法——偏序集因果信道（poset-causal channels），并开发了一种基于对称性优化的方法，为具有马尔可夫性和对称性的子类信道建立了单字母反馈容量上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于计算信道容量通常难以处理，现有方法仅适用于少数具有记忆的信道类别，因此需要新的理论和方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过偏序集索引信道输入和输出，利用对称性优化技术，建立单字母反馈容量上界。

Result: 该方法在NOST信道及其二维扩展上验证，上界在NOST信道中紧致。

Conclusion: 偏序集因果信道及其分析方法为具有特定结构的信道提供了新的容量表征工具。

Abstract: Computing channel capacity is in general intractable because it is given by
the limit of a sequence of optimization problems whose dimensionality grows to
infinity. As a result, constant-sized characterizations of feedback or
non-feedback capacity are known for only a few classes of channels with memory.
This paper introduces poset-causal channels$\unicode{x2014}$a new formalism of
a communication channel in which channel inputs and outputs are indexed by the
elements of a partially ordered set (poset). We develop a novel methodology
that allows us to establish a single-letter upper bound on the feedback
capacity of a subclass of poset-causal channels whose memory structure exhibits
a Markov property and symmetry. The methodology is based on symmetry reduction
in optimization. We instantiate our method on two channel models: the Noisy
Output is The STate (NOST) channel$\unicode{x2014}$for which the bound is
tight$\unicode{x2014}$and a new two-dimensional extension of it.

### [4] [Can Movable Antenna-enabled Micro-Mobility Replace UAV-enabled Macro-Mobility? A Physical Layer Security Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19456)
*Kaixuan Li,Kan Yu,Dingyou Ma,Yujia Zhao,Xiaowu Liu,Qixun Zhang,ZHiyong Feng*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 比较了可移动天线（MA）微移动与无人机（UAV）宏移动在增强空对地通信物理层安全（PLS）中的潜力，发现两者各有优势，并提出混合微-宏移动方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MA微移动是否能替代UAV宏移动以提升PLS，解决UAV的高能耗、延迟和复杂轨迹优化问题。

Method: 建立双尺度移动框架，分别优化MA的微移动（天线位置和波束成形）和UAV的宏移动（轨迹和波束成形），并进行仿真比较。

Result: MA在低功率或天线受限时表现更优，而UAV在高资源条件下更具优势。

Conclusion: MA和UAV互补，混合方案有望平衡安全、能效和部署复杂度。

Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of movable antenna (MA)-enabled
micro-mobility to replace UAV-enabled macro-mobility for enhancing physical
layer security (PLS) in air-to-ground communications. While UAV trajectory
optimization offers high flexibility and Line-of-Sight (LoS) advantages, it
suffers from significant energy consumption, latency, and complex trajectory
optimization. Conversely, MA technology provides fine-grained spatial
reconfiguration (antenna positioning within a confined area) with ultra-low
energy overhead and millisecond-scale response, enabling real-time channel
manipulation and covert beam steering. To systematically compare these
paradigms, we establish a dual-scale mobility framework where a UAV-mounted
uniform linear array (ULA) serves as a base station transmitting confidential
information to a legitimate user (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper
(Eve). We formulate non-convex average secrecy rate (ASR) maximization problems
for both schemes: 1) MA-based micro-mobility: Jointly optimizing antenna
positions and beamforming (BF) vectors under positioning constraints; 2)
UAV-based macro-mobility: Jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and BF
vectors under kinematic constraints. Extensive simulations reveal distinct
operational regimes: MA micro-mobility demonstrates significant ASR advantages
in low-transmit-power scenarios or under antenna constraints due to its
energy-efficient spatial control. Conversely, UAV macro-mobility excels under
resource-sufficient conditions (higher power, larger antenna arrays) by
leveraging global mobility for optimal positioning. The findings highlight the
complementary strengths of both approaches, suggesting hybrid micro-macro
mobility as a promising direction for balancing security, energy efficiency,
and deployment complexity in future wireless networks.

### [5] [Robust and Resilient Networks with Integrated Sensing, Communication and Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19518)
*Ming-Chun Lee,Christian Eckrich,Vahid Jamali,Yu-Chih Huang,Arash Asadi,Li-Chun Wang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文综述了集成感知、通信和计算（ISCC）系统在资源有限情况下的鲁棒性和韧性设计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ISCC系统在关键应用中的普及，需要确保其在高性能的同时具备鲁棒性和韧性。

Method: 介绍了ISCC系统中鲁棒性和韧性的关键概念，并讨论了实现这些特性的设计方法。

Result: 通过案例研究和开放问题的讨论，展示了ISCC系统的设计挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: ISCC系统需在资源有限的情况下兼顾鲁棒性和韧性，未来研究需进一步解决相关开放问题。

Abstract: Emerging applications such as networked robotics, intelligent transportation,
smart factories, and virtual and augmented reality demand integrated perception
and connectivity enabled by wireless communication. This has driven growing
interests in integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) systems,
with a primary focus on their efficient co-designs. However, as ISCC systems
increasingly support critical applications, they must not only deliver high
performance but also demonstrate robustness and resilience. In this context,
robustness refers to a system's ability to maintain performance under
uncertainties, while resilience denotes its capacity to sustain a minimum level
of service in the face of major disruptions. To address this gap, this article
presents an overview of ISCC systems from the perspectives of robustness and
resilience under limited resources. First, key concepts related to these
properties are introduced in the ISCC context. Subsequently, design approaches
for realizing robust and resilient ISCC networks are discussed. Finally, the
article concludes with the discussions of a case study and open research
problems in this area.

### [6] [Balanced Boolean functions with few-valued Walsh spectra parameterized by $P(x^2+x)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19521)
*Qiancheng Zhang,Kangquan Li,Longjiang Qu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文通过构造方法研究多值谱布尔函数，提出新的四值谱布尔函数族和七类平台函数，具有良好密码学特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多值谱布尔函数在密码学、编码理论和序列设计中的广泛应用。

Method: 采用参数化构造方法，利用$2$-to-$1$映射$P(x^2+x)$，其中$P$为精心选择的置换多项式。

Result: 1. 建立新的四值谱布尔函数族，具有高非线性度、最大代数次数和最优代数免疫性；2. 推导出七类平台函数，包括四类半弯曲函数和一类近弯曲函数。

Conclusion: 提出的构造方法为密码学应用提供了新的布尔函数族，具有优越的密码学特性。

Abstract: Boolean functions with few-valued spectra have wide applications in
cryptography, coding theory, sequence designs, etc. In this paper, we further
study the parametric construction approach to obtain balanced Boolean functions
using $2$-to-$1$ mappings of the form $P(x^2+x)$, where $P$ denotes carefully
selected permutation polynomials. The key contributions of this work are
twofold: (1) We establish a new family of four-valued spectrum Boolean
functions. This family includes Boolean functions with good cryptographic
properties, e.g., the same nonlinearity as semi-bent functions, the maximal
algebraic degree, and the optimal algebraic immunity for dimensions $n \leq
14$. (2) We derive seven distinct classes of plateaued functions, including
four infinite families of semi-bent functions and a class of near-bent
functions.

### [7] [A New Quantum Interferometric Protocol Using Spin-Dependent Displacements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19544)
*Necati Celik,Songul Akbulut Ozen,Burhan Engin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种量子干涉协议，利用自旋依赖的空间位移实现超越经典极限的高精度参数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过自旋与动量的耦合，生成自旋态与空间位置的纠缠，实现相干空间叠加态，提升参数估计的灵敏度。

Method: 利用自旋与动量的幺正耦合生成空间干涉条纹，通过相位差重建实现海森堡极限灵敏度。

Result: 在磁场传感中验证了协议的有效性，量子Fisher信息分析显示亚散粒噪声标度。

Conclusion: 该协议为量子计量学提供了通用框架，可扩展至多参数传感和引力波探测。

Abstract: We propose a quantum interferometric protocol that leverages spin-dependent
spatial displacements to enable high-precision parameter estimation beyond
classical limits. By inducing a unitary coupling between a particles spin
degree of freedom and its momentum, the protocol generates entanglement between
spin states and spatial positions, resulting in coherent spatial
superpositions. Interferometric reconstruction of the resulting phase
differences enables Heisenberg limited sensitivity for parameters encoded in
the spin Hamiltonian. As a concrete application, we demonstrate the protocols
effectiveness in magnetic field sensing, where the field is transduced into
spatial interference fringes. Quantum Fisher information analysis confirms
sub-shot-noise scaling, and the protocol's feasibility is discussed for
physical platforms including ultracold atoms and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers.
Our framework provides a versatile approach to quantum metrology with potential
extensions to multiparameter sensing and gravitational wave detection.

### [8] [On the Age of Information in Single-Server Queues with Aged Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19648)
*Fernando Miguelez,Urtzi Ayesta,Josu Doncel,Maria Dolores Ugarte*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 研究了数据包初始年龄非零时的信息年龄（AoI），推导了平均AoI的表达式，并探讨了其在不同队列场景中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设数据包初始年龄为零，忽视了多跳网络或分布式传感中数据包可能存在的初始延迟。

Method: 推导了非零初始年龄下的平均AoI表达式，并分析了其与标准AoI的关系，同时建立了未知依赖结构时的上下界。

Result: 平均AoI等于标准AoI加上一个修正项，若变量独立则修正项为初始年龄均值。在不同队列场景中验证了方法的适用性。

Conclusion: 为非零初始年龄的AoI分析提供了理论框架，扩展了AoI在复杂网络中的应用范围。

Abstract: The Age of Information (AoI) is a performance metric that quantifies the
freshness of data in systems where timely updates are critical. Most
state-of-the-art methods typically assume that packets enter the monitored
system with zero age, neglecting situations, such as those prevalent in
multi-hop networks or distributed sensing, where packets experience prior
delays. In this paper, the AoI is investigated when packets have a non-zero
initial age. We derive an expression for the average AoI in this setting,
showing that it equals the standard AoI plus a correction term involving the
correlation between packet age and inter-departure times. When these variables
are independent, the expression simplifies to an additive correction equal to
the mean initial age. In cases where the dependency structure is unknown, we
also establish lower and upper bounds for the correction term. We demonstrate
the applicability of our approach across various queueing scenarios, such as
forwarding, tandem, and retrial queues. Additionally, we explore the accuracy
of the derived bounds on a tandem composed of several queues, a model that has
not yet been analytically solved from an age perspective.

### [9] [Performance Analysis of OAMP Detection for ODDM Modulation in Satellite Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19688)
*Yu Liu,Cunhua Pan,Tantao Gong,Yinlu Wang,Ming Chen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了6G无线网络中LEO卫星通信的ODDM调制多样性增益，提出了一种基于OAMP的检测器，通过迭代线性与非线性估计器提取全多样性增益，仿真表明其性能优于传统方法且复杂度更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO卫星通信在6G网络中具有潜力，但高移动性场景下链路可靠性是关键问题。ODDM调制因其多样性增益特性受到关注，但需要高效检测器以实现其潜力。

Method: 提出基于OAMP的检测器，通过迭代线性与非线性估计器利用DD域信道的稀疏性，提取ODDM调制的全多样性增益。

Result: 仿真揭示了多样性增益与系统参数的关系，并显示OAMP检测器性能优于传统方法，复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: OAMP检测器能有效提取ODDM调制的多样性增益，为6G卫星通信提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Towards future 6G wireless networks, low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have
been widely considered as a promising component to enhance the terrestrial
communications. To ensure the link reliability of high-mobility satellite
communication scenarios, the emerging orthogonal delay-Doppler division
multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has attracted significant research attention. In
this paper, we study the diversity gain achieved by ODDM modulation along with
the mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. Additionally, we propose
an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm based detector to
harvest the diversity gain promised by ODDM modulation. By operating the linear
and non-linear estimator iteratively, the orthogonal approximate message
passing (OAMP) detector can utilize the sparsity of the effective delay-Doppler
(DD) domain channel and extract the full diversity. Simulation results reveal
the relationship between diversity gain and system parameters, and demonstrate
that our proposed detector can achieve better performance than the conventional
message passing methods with significantly reduced complexity.

### [10] [The Voronoi Spherical CDF for Lattices and Linear Codes: New Bounds for Quantization and Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19791)
*Or Ordentlich*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文定义了Voronoi球面累积分布函数（CDF），并通过一阶矩方法和Jensen不等式推导了随机格/线性码的期望Voronoi球面CDF下界。这些下界接近基于球的平凡下界，并转化为对高斯噪声信道中随机格的归一化二阶矩和错误概率的改进上界，以及对二进制对称信道中随机线性码的Hamming失真和错误概率的改进上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究格/线性码的Voronoi球面CDF，以改进对随机格和线性码性能的理论分析。

Method: 使用一阶矩方法和Jensen不等式推导期望Voronoi球面CDF的下界。

Result: 提出的下界接近基于球的平凡下界，并转化为对随机格和线性码性能的改进上界。

Conclusion: 论文为随机格和线性码的性能分析提供了新的理论工具和改进的上界。

Abstract: For a lattice/linear code, we define the Voronoi spherical cumulative density
function (CDF) as the CDF of the $\ell_2$-norm/Hamming weight of a random
vector uniformly distributed over the Voronoi cell. Using the first moment
method together with a simple application of Jensen's inequality, we develop
lower bounds on the expected Voronoi spherical CDF of a random lattice/linear
code. Our bounds are quite close to a trivial ball-based lower bound and
immediately translate to improved upper bounds on the normalized second moment
and the error probability of a random lattice over the additive white Gaussian
noise channel, as well as improved upper bounds on the Hamming distortion and
the error probability of a random linear code over the binary symmetric
channel.

### [11] [SIM-Enabled Hybrid Digital-Wave Beamforming for Fronthaul-Constrained Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19090)
*Eunhyuk Park,Seok-Hwan Park,Osvaldo Simeone,Marco Di Renzo,Shlomo Shamai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合波域波束成形和数字处理的混合波束成形框架，以解决CF-mMIMO系统中AP密集部署带来的高成本和前传需求问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集部署AP在CF-mMIMO系统中带来高实现成本和前传需求，传统大规模天线阵列（LAAs）方法成本高昂。

Method: 采用堆叠智能超表面（SIM）实现波域波束成形，结合数字处理，通过交替优化算法解决联合优化问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案优于传统混合方案，且在多数情况下接近全数字性能。

Conclusion: 所提混合波束成形框架能显著减少RF链需求，同时提升性能，适用于CF-mMIMO系统。

Abstract: As the dense deployment of access points (APs) in cell-free massive
multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems presents significant
challenges, per-AP coverage can be expanded using large-scale antenna arrays
(LAAs). However, this approach incurs high implementation costs and substantial
fronthaul demands due to the need for dedicated RF chains for all antennas. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid beamforming framework that
integrates wave-domain beamforming via stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM)
with conventional digital processing. By dynamically manipulating
electromagnetic waves, SIM-equipped APs enhance beamforming gains while
significantly reducing RF chain requirements. We formulate a joint optimization
problem for digital and wave-domain beamforming along with fronthaul
compression to maximize the weighted sum-rate for both uplink and downlink
transmission under finite-capacity fronthaul constraints. Given the high
dimensionality and non-convexity of the problem, we develop alternating
optimization-based algorithms that iteratively optimize digital and wave-domain
variables. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid schemes
outperform conventional hybrid schemes, that rely on randomly set wave-domain
beamformers or restrict digital beamforming to simple power control. Moreover,
the proposed scheme employing sufficiently deep SIMs achieves near
fully-digital performance with fewer RF chains in most simulated cases, except
in the downlink at low signal-to-noise ratios.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个基于大规模EEG数据集的竞赛，包含两个挑战：跨任务和跨被试的零样本解码，以及从EEG数据预测心理健康指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG解码模型通常基于少量被试和单一任务训练，缺乏泛化能力。通过大规模数据集和竞赛，推动跨任务和跨被试的模型发展，为计算精神病学和临床研究提供支持。

Method: 使用包含3000多名被试的多任务高密度EEG数据集，提供可调神经网络基线模型，包括简单网络和基于人口统计的回归模型。

Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on
small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a
large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges.
First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that
can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second,
the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer
subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an
unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128
channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in
multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network
baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and
demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across
tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of
adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly,
predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might
identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of
personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances
spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational
psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both
fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.

*Yuanyuan Zhang,Haocheng Zhao,Sijie Xiong,Rui Yang,Eng Gee Lim,Yutao Yue*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于雷达的ECG恢复方法，通过CFT算法和RFcardi模型解决数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有雷达信号恢复ECG的方法依赖高质量信号和大量数据，限制了在新场景中的应用。

Method: 使用CFT算法精确跟踪心脏位置，提出RFcardi模型利用心脏特征稀疏性，仅需少量雷达-ECG对微调。

Result: CFT能动态定位心脏，RFcardi模型在少量数据训练后能有效恢复ECG。

Conclusion: 该方法在新场景中具有潜力，解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been
successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the
performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous
radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due
to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery
in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking
(CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient
acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning
model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the
radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of
cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to
fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results
reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and
the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using
a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are
available after the publication.

### [14] [Holographic Communication via Recordable and Reconfigurable Metasurface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19376)
*Jinzhe Wang,Qinghua Guo,Xiaojun Yuan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可记录和可重构超表面（RRM）的新型全息通信方案，无需信道估计即可实现与现有方案相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可重构全息表面（RHS）的方案需要信道状态信息（CSI），而信道估计在超表面通信中具有挑战性。

Method: 结合全息原理的记录和重构过程，引入RRM，避免信道估计。

Result: 所提方案在无需信道估计的情况下，性能与完美CSI的RHS方案相当。

Conclusion: RRM方案为未来无线通信网络提供了一种有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Holographic surface based communication technologies are anticipated to play
a significant role in the next generation of wireless networks. The existing
reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS)-based scheme only utilizes the
reconstruction process of the holographic principle for beamforming, where the
channel sate information (CSI) is needed. However, channel estimation for CSI
acquirement is a challenging task in metasurface based communications. In this
study, inspired by both the recording and reconstruction processes of
holography, we develop a novel holographic communication scheme by introducing
recordable and reconfigurable metasurfaces (RRMs), where channel estimation is
not needed thanks to the recording process. Then we analyze the input-output
mutual information of the RRM-based communication system and compare it with
the existing RHS based system. Our results show that, without channel
estimation, the proposed scheme achieves performance comparable to that of the
RHS scheme with perfect CSI, suggesting a promising alternative for future
wireless communication networks.

### [15] [Low-Complexity Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Lookahead Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19451)
*Seunghun Lee,Jihong Park,Jinho Choi,Hyuncheol Park*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SemPA-Look的框架，通过优化令牌分组来最大化令牌相似性，解决了因令牌依赖关系导致的通信中断问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 令牌通信（TC）中，每个令牌的语义依赖于上下文，单个令牌的丢失会显著扭曲原始语义。因此，需要优化令牌分组以保持语义完整性。

Method: 提出了SemPA-Look框架，结合残差语义分数（RSS）和前瞻搜索算法，以线性复杂度实现高效的令牌分组。

Result: 在MS-COCO数据集上的实验表明，SemPA-Look在保持高令牌相似性的同时，计算复杂度降低了40倍。

Conclusion: SemPA-Look是一种高效且实用的方法，适用于远程AIGC和其他TC应用。

Abstract: Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling
remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike
traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each
token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency
makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can
significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this
paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token
similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage
channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is
combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To
address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with
lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces
the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the
message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain
token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a
lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates
without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates
sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.
Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned
images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores
comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up
to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the
genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity,
demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.

densely deployed antennas. Leveraging multiport communication theory, we
analyze both coherent and noncoherent detection approaches in a single-user
uplink scenario where the receiver ignores mutual coupling effects. Simulation
results indicate that while coherent detection is generally more accurate, it
is highly sensitive to mismatches in the coupling model, leading to severe
performance degradation when antennas are closely spaced, to the point of
becoming unusable. Noncoherent detection, on the other hand, exhibits a higher
error probability but is more robust to coupling model mismatches.

Abstract: Future wireless networks are expected to be AI-empowered, making their
performance highly dependent on the quality of training datasets. However,
physical-layer entities often observe only partial wireless environments
characterized by different power delay profiles. Federated learning is capable
of addressing this limited observability, but often struggles with data
heterogeneity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a neural collapse (NC)
inspired deep supervised federated learning (NCDSFL) algorithm.

Abstract: Localization of in-body devices is beneficial for Gastrointestinal (GI)
diagnosis and targeted treatment. Traditional methods such as imaging and
endoscopy are invasive and limited in resolution, highlighting the need for
innovative alternatives. This study presents an experimental framework for
Radio Frequency (RF)-backscatter-based in-body localization, inspired by the
ReMix approach, and evaluates its performance in real-world conditions. The
experimental setup includes an in-body backscatter device and various off-body
antenna configurations to investigate harmonic generation and reception in air,
chicken and pork tissues. The results indicate that optimal backscatter device
positioning, antenna selection, and gain settings significantly impact
performance, with denser biological tissues leading to greater attenuation. The
study also highlights challenges such as external interference and plastic
enclosures affecting propagation. The findings emphasize the importance of
interference mitigation and refined propagation models to enhance performance.

spanning theoretical foundations, design aspects, and practical deployment
considerations. In contrast to existing surveys that focus on isolated aspects,
this work offers an integrated view covering use cases, control mechanisms,
channel sounding methodologies, and channel estimation strategies. Each of
these topics is reviewed through the lens of recent literature, synthesizing
the latest advancements to provide updated insights for both academic
researchers and industry practitioners. It further addresses emerging topics
such as standardization activities and industrial perspectives, which are often
overlooked in prior literature. By bridging theoretical insights with practical
challenges, this survey aims to provide a holistic understanding of RIS and
support its evolution from a research concept toward real-world implementation.

Abstract: We present a novel system architecture for a distributed wireless,
self-calibrating ultrasound microphone network for synchronized in-air acoustic
sensing. Once deployed the embedded nodes determine their position in the
environment using the infrared optical tracking system found in the HTC Vive
Lighthouses. After self-calibration, the nodes start sampling the ultrasound
microphone while embedding a synchronization signal in the data which is
established using a wireless Sub-1GHz RF link. Data transmission is handled via
the Wi-Fi 6 radio that is embedded in the nodes' SoC, decoupling
synchronization from payload transport. A prototype system with a limited
amount of network nodes was used to verify the proposed distributed microphone
array's wireless data acquisition and synchronization capabilities. This
architecture lays the groundwork for scalable, deployable ultrasound arrays for
sound source localization applications in bio-acoustic research and industrial
acoustic monitoring.

Abstract: Atmospheric attenuation, atmospheric turbulence, geometric spread, and
pointing errors, degrade the performance of free-space optical transmission. In
the weak turbulence regime, the probability density function describing the
distribution of the channel fading coefficient that models these four effects
is known in the literature. This function is an integral equation, which makes
it difficult to find simple analytical expressions of important performance
metrics such as the bit error rate (BER) and symbol error rate (SER). In this
paper, we present simple and accurate approximations of the average BER and SER
for pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) in the weak turbulence regime for an
intensity modulation and direct detection system. Our numerical results show
that the proposed expressions exhibit excellent accuracy when compared against
Monte Carlo simulations. To demonstrate the usefulness of the developed
approximations, we perform two asymptotic analyses. First, we investigate the
additional transmit power required to maintain the same SER when the spectral
efficiency increases by 1 bit/symbol. Second, we study the asymptotic behavior
of our SER approximation for dense PAM constellations and high transmit power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代IM-DD系统在数据中心中需要达到400 Gb/s/通道及更高速率，但增加光功率会引入RIN，限制系统性能。

Result: 提出的表达式与概率和几何整形系统的数值模拟完全匹配。

Conclusion: 该表达式为IM-DD系统的性能评估提供了通用且准确的工具。

Abstract: Next-generation intensity-modulation (IM) and direct-detection (DD) systems
used in data centers are expected to operate at 400 Gb/s/lane and beyond. Such
rates can be achieved by increasing the system bandwidth or the modulation
format, which in turn requires maintaining or increasing the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR). Such SNR requirements can be achieved by increasing the
transmitted optical power. This increase in optical power causes the emergence
of relative intensity noise (RIN), a signal-dependent impairment inherent to
the transmitter laser, which ultimately limits the performance of the system.
In this paper, we develop an analytical symbol error rate (SER) expression for
the optimal detector for the IM-DD optical link under study. The developed
expression takes into account the signal-dependent nature of RIN and does not
make any assumptions on the geometry or probability distribution of the
constellation. Our expression is therefore applicable to general
probabilistically and/or geometrically shaped systems. Unlike results available
in the literature, our proposed expression provides a perfect match to
numerical simulations of probabilistic and geometrically shaped systems.
