Recently, two PSD estimators mitigated the loud transient impact\non PSD estimates by applying order statistics filtering (OSF). The first, the\nSchwock and Abadi Welch Percentile, scales a single rank order statistic (OS)\nof consecutive periodograms. The second, the truncated linear order statistics\nfilter, is a weighted sum of OS up to a chosen rank. In order to minimize\nvariance, both OSFs must carefully choose the highest rank that still\neliminates the loud transients. However, in real-time applications in dynamic\nenvironments, loud transients occur at unpredictable rates, requiring dynamic\nadjustment of the OSF ranks to keep low bias and variance. To circumvent the\nchallenges of real-time rank selection, this paper proposes a convex sum of\nOSFs across ranks with blending weights that are sequentially adjusted to favor\nthe lowest variance OSFs over a recent time window. The performance of the\nblended sum provably approaches the performance of the best fixed rank OSF.\nSimulations and real data confirm the blended OSFs effectively filter loud\ntransients out of spectrograms without explicitly choosing a threshold rank."}

The sensor array is\noften towed behind the ship, using a long flexible cable to reduce interference\nfrom the own-ship's inherent noises. This forms a towed cable sensor-array\nsystem (TCSAS). During BOT, the tow-ship has to perform a manoeuvre to make the\ntracking system observable. Such a manoeuvre destabilises the TCSAS, thus\nmaking its exact location unknown \\emph{w.r.t.} tow-ship.

The power consumption of diversity combining\nprocess is also taken into account to analyze the net benefit of diversity\ncombining. Performances of RFEH systems are investigated for selection\ncombining (SC), equal gain combining (EGC), and maximal ratio combining (MRC)\ntechniques. Simulations are conducted to compare the numerical results of SC,\nEGC, and MRC, and the results show that although the diversity combining\ntechniques can improve the energy harvesting performance, the power consumption\nparameters have a critical importance while determining the suitable technique."}
