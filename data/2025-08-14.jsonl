In this paper, we introduce\nRadioMamba, a hybrid Mamba-UNet architecture for RM construction to address the\ntrade-off. Generally, accurate RM construction requires modeling long-range\nspatial dependencies, reflecting the global nature of wave propagation physics.\nRadioMamba utilizes a Mamba-Convolutional block where the Mamba branch captures\nthese global dependencies with linear complexity, while a parallel\nconvolutional branch extracts local features. This hybrid design generates\nfeature representations that capture both global context and local detail.\nExperiments show that RadioMamba achieves higher accuracy than existing\nmethods, including diffusion models, while operating nearly 20 times faster and\nusing only 2.9\\% of the model parameters.
