However, this sequential design approach does not fully\naddress the trade-offs between high-frequency and LDO-induced low-frequency\nphase noise. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a co-design\nmethod for low phase-noise LC-tank VCOs powered by LDOs. It is difficult to\ncarry out the co-design using traditional manual design techniques. Hence, an\nefficient AI-driven EDA algorithm is used. To validate the proposed method, a\n5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO with an integrated LDO is designed using a 65 nm CMOS\nprocess.

While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable\nalternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected\nby drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent\nInference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference\nto correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,\neliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a\ndisentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the\ntrue pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address\nthe lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air\nQuality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR).

To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning\ntasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are\ndeveloped for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and\ntransferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA)\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly\nadapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum\nsensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification\n(WTC).

This study presents a novel multimodal monitoring framework,\nsynergistically integrating contact-based acoustic emission (AE) sensing with\ncoaxial camera vision to enable layer-wise identification and evaluation of\ngeometric variations in DED parts. The experimental study used three part\nconfigurations: a baseline part without holes, a part with a 3mm diameter\nthrough-hole, and one with a 5mm through-hole to test the system's discerning\ncapabilities. Raw sensor data was preprocessed: acoustic signals were filtered\nfor time-domain and frequency-domain feature extraction, while camera data\nunderwent melt pool segmentation and morphological feature extraction. Multiple\nmachine learning algorithms (including SVM, random forest, and XGBoost) were\nevaluated to find the optimal model for classifying layer-wise geometric\nvariations.

Submitted to IEEE", "summary": "Orthogonal signaling limits the number of information symbols transmitted in\nbandwidth $B$ and time $T$ to be $BT$. This corresponds to the Nyquist\nsignaling and is achieved by mounting information symbols on $BT$-dimensional\nbasis spanning the $BT$-dimensional space spaced $\\frac{1}{B}$ and\n$\\frac{1}{T}$ apart. Faster-than-Nyquist signaling involves transmitting more\nthan $BT$ informational symbols in a $BT$-dimensional space. This leads to loss\nof orthogonality. This is achieved by time and/or bandwidth expansion resulting\nfrom packing more information symbols in the same $BT$-dimensional space\n(spacing less than $\\frac{1}{B}$ and/or $\\frac{1}{T}$). In this paper, we take\na different approach to faster-than-Nyquist signaling. We propose to\nsuperimpose the information symbols on one another maintaining the original\nspacing in the Nyquist signaling. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS)\nmodulation. In Zak-OTFS, the channel varies slowly. Further Zak-OTFS also\nallows construction of mutually unbiased bases the interference between which\nappear like Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme leverages the slow variation in\nthe DD channel to construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the\ndoubly-spread channel. Further, in the proposed scheme we mount information\nsymbols on two mutually unbiased bases which allows superposition of\ninformation symbols. This simplifies receiver processing to detection in\nGaussian noise since each basis appears to the other as Gaussian noise. This\nreduction makes it possible to use trellis coded modulation to enhance\nbit-error performance.

To enhance their practicality,\nwe propose metasurface-enabled extremely large-scale antenna (MELA) systems --\nnovel transceiver architectures that employ reconfigurable transmissive\nmetasurfaces to facilitate efficient over-the-air RF-to-antenna coupling and\nphase control. This architecture eliminates the need for bulky switch matrices\nand costly phase-shifter networks typically required in conventional solutions.\nPhysically grounded models are developed to characterize electromagnetic field\npropagation through individual transmissive unit cells, capturing the\nfundamental physics of wave transformation and transmission. Additionally,\ndistance-dependent approximate models are introduced, exhibiting structural\nproperties conducive to efficient parameter estimation and signal processing.\nBased on the channel model, a two stage channel estimation framework is\nproposed for the scenarios comprising users in the hybrid near- and far-fields.\nIn the first stage, a dictionary-driven beamspace filtering technique enables\nrapid angular-domain scanning.

Radar technologies offer a promising sensing\nmodality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar\ntechnologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of\nvarious objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained\nto closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data\ncollection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical\napplicability. This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful\nreasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material\ncomposition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due\nto the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs\nhave no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we\nintroduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using\nLLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a\nphysics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar\nraw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the\nmaterial's intrinsic characteristics. Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge,\nenabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters.\nLeveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step\nreasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material\nrecognition directly from raw radar signals.

To address these challenges in vector quantization (VQ)-based image\nsemantic communication systems, we propose FedSFR, a novel federated learning\n(FL) framework that incorporates semantic feature reconstruction (FR).

We propose an effective channel state information (CSI) acquisition\nscheme for the monitoring system. In our approach, the MNs leverage the pilot\nsignals transmitted during the uplink and downlink phases of the untrusted link\nand estimate the effective channels corresponding to the UT and UR via a\nminimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation scheme. We derive new spectral\nefficiency (SE) expressions for the untrusted link and the monitoring system.\nFor the latter, the SE is derived for two CSI availability cases at the central\nprocessing unit (CPU); namely case-1: imperfect CSI knowledge at both MNs and\nCPU, case-2: imperfect CSI knowledge at the MNs and no CSI knowledge at the\nCPU. To improve the monitoring performance, we propose a novel joint mode\nassignment and jamming power control optimization method to maximize the\nmonitoring success probability (MSP) based on the Bayesian optimization\nframework. Numerical results show that (a) our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring\nsystem relying on the proposed CSI acquisition and optimization approach\nsignificantly outperforms the considered benchmarks; (b) the MSP performance of\nour CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring system is greater than 0.8, regardless of the\nnumber of antennas at the untrusted nodes or the precoding scheme for the\nuntrusted transmission link.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\uff08CF-mMIMO\uff09\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CSI\uff09\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\u8282\u70b9\uff08MNs\uff09\u89c2\u5bdf\u6216\u5e72\u6270\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u76d1\u63a7\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u884c\u548c\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u5bfc\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MMSE\uff09\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CF-mMIMO\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76d1\u63a7\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08MSP\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14MSP\u6027\u80fd\u59cb\u7ec8\u9ad8\u4e8e0.8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CSI\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CF-mMIMO\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\u8282\u70b9\u3002"}}

DTDD enables the CF mMIMO system to\nconcurrently serve both uplink~(UL) and downlink~(DL) users with spatially\nseparated \\emph{half-duplex~(HD)} access points~(APs) using the same\ntime-frequency resources. Further, to facilitate ISAC, the UL APs are utilized\nfor both UL data and target echo reception, while the DL APs jointly transmit\nthe precoded DL data streams and target signal. In this context, we present\ncentralized and distributed generalized likelihood-ratio tests~(GLRTs) for\ntarget detection treating UL users' signals as sensing interference. We then\nquantify the optimality and complexity trade-off between distributed and\ncentralized GLRTs and benchmark the respective estimators with the Bayesian\nCram\\'er-Rao lower bound for target radar-cross section~(RCS). Then, we present\na unified framework for joint UL users' data detection and RCS estimation.\nNext, for communication, we derive the signal-to-noise-plus-interference~(SINR)\noptimal combiner accounting for the cross-link and radar interference for UL\ndata processing. In DL, we use regularized zero-forcing for the users and\npropose two types of precoders for the target: one ``user-centric\" that\nnullifies the interference caused by the target signal to the DL users and one\n``target-centric\" based on the dominant eigenvector of the composite channel\nbetween the target and the APs. Finally, numerical studies corroborate with our\ntheoretical findings and reveal that the \\emph{GLRT is robust to inter-AP\ninterference, and DTDD doubles the $90\\%$-likely sum UL-DL SE compared to\ntraditional TDD-based CF-mMIMO ISAC systems}; while using HD hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u5206\u53cc\u5de5\uff08DTDD\uff09\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\uff08CF\uff09\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\uff08mMIMO\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7DTDD\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u884c\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528UL AP\u8fdb\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u5e72\u6270\u5904\u7406\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fGLRT\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8054\u5408UL\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0eRCS\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cGLRT\u5bf9AP\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14DTDD\u5728HD\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u5206\u53cc\u5de5\uff08DTDD\uff09\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\uff08CF\uff09\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u884c\u7528\u6237\u5171\u5b58\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fGLRT\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u5206\u6790\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408UL\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0eRCS\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff1b4. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86UL\u548cDL\u7684SINR\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u5668\u548c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cGLRT\u5bf9AP\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cDTDD\u5728HD\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u884cSE\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e00\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DTDD\u548cGLRT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CF-mMIMO ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}
