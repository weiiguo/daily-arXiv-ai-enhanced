The presence of a LOS impacts other channel characteristics such as pathloss, fading depth, delay- and angular spread, etc.. Existing models, although useful, are based on very limited datasets. In this paper, we establish a framework to produce high accuracy LOS models from geospatial data in different environments, and apply it to create a LOS model for macrocells, using datasets of the United States (US) on a nationalscale, using more than 13, 000 locations of real-world macrocells. Based on this we create a new, fully parameterized model that better describes macrocell deployments in the US than the 3GPP model. We furthermore demonstrate that for improved accuracy the LOS probability should be modeled on a per cell basis, and the model parameters treated as random variables; we provide a full description and parameterization of this novel approach and by simulations show that it better predicts the inter-cell interference at the cell-edge than an average-based model."}

However, due to the inflexibility of the minimum error entropy (MEE), this algorithm demonstrates limited robustness when confronted with more complex noise environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a generalized mixture minimum error entropy-based (GMMEE) square-root cubature Kalman filter (GMMEE-SRCKF). The square-root algorithm ensures improved numerical stability and avoids covariance degeneration, while the GMMEE criterion with two flexible kernels adapts effectively to non-Gaussian noise. Moreover, a hybrid tree seed and genetic algorithm (TSGA) is introduced to optimize the kernel parameters automatically. Experimental results confirm that the TSGA-optimized GMMEE-SRCKF outperforms existing robust filters, achieving the root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 0.5%."}

However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches."}

However, existing designs sit at two costly extremes: dynamic reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer fine beam control but require dense cabling, continuous power consumption, and substantial signaling overhead, whereas low-cost static surfaces require no control lines or electronics but are limited to a single beam pattern. This disparity leaves a practical gap for quasi-static environments, such as industrial Internet-of-things and smart agriculture scenarios, where channels are stable with user demands changing only occasionally or periodically, and neither extreme is sufficiently economical or flexible. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel movable intelligent surface (MIS) architecture, whose beam patterns are switched not by electronic phase tuning but by mechanically sliding a small, pre-phased secondary metasurface layer across a larger, likewise static primary layer. We develop an MIS signal model that characterizes the interaction between static phase elements with dynamic geometry via binary selection matrices. Based on this model, we formulate a new type of optimization problems that jointly design static phase shifts and the overlapping position selection of MS2 (equal to beam pattern scheduling). Efficient algorithms based on the penalty method, block coordinate descent, and Riemannian manifold optimization are proposed to tackle these mixed-integer non-convex problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIS architecture substantially narrows the performance gap between single-layer static surfaces and dynamic RISs, providing a practical and flexible solution for quasi-static wireless applications."}

While it is well known that the Gaussian prior uniquely induces linear conditional means under Gaussian noise, the analogous question for the conditional median (i.e., the optimal estimator under absolute-error loss) has only recently been settled. Building on the prior work establishing this uniqueness, we develop a quantitative stability theory that characterizes how approximate linearity of the optimal estimator constrains the prior distribution. For $L^2$ loss, we derive explicit rates showing that near-linearity of the conditional mean implies proximity of the prior to the Gaussian in the Lévy metric. For $L^1$ loss, we introduce a Hermite expansion framework and analyze the adjoint of the linearity-defining operator to show that the Gaussian remains the unique stable solution. Together, these results provide a more complete functional-analytic understanding of linearity and stability in Bayesian estimation under Gaussian noise."}

To address this, we propose a novel gridless sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for joint super-resolution multi-target detection and high-accuracy parameter estimation with manageable computational cost. Our model treats target parameters as continuous variables to bypass the grid limitations of conventional approaches. This SBL formulation, however, transforms the estimation task into a challenging high-dimensional inference problem, which we address by developing an enhanced gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Our method integrates mini-batch sampling and the Adam optimizer to ensure computational efficiency and rapid convergence. Finally, we validate the framework's robustness in strong clutter and provide a theoretical benchmark by deriving the corresponding Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound. Simulation results demonstrate remarkable super-resolution capabilities, successfully resolving multiple targets separated by merely 50% of the Rayleigh limit in range, 17% in velocity, and 52% in angle. At a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 dB, the algorithm achieves a multi-target detection probability exceeding 90% while concurrently delivering ultra-high accuracy, with root mean square error of 0.07 m, 0.024 m/s, and 0.015 degree for range, velocity, and angle, respectively. This robust performance, demonstrated against strong clutter, showcases its suitability for practical ISAC-LAWNs applications."}

In this paper, a distributed cubature Kalman filter based on adaptive minimum error entropy with fiducial points (AMEEF) criterion (AMEEF-DCKF) is proposed to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, firstly, in order to solve the influence of various types of non-Gaussian noise and abnormal data, the AMEEF optimization criterion is designed, in which the kernels used are Cauchy kernels with adaptive bandwidth. At the same time, the designed optimization criterion has enhanced the numerical stability and optimized the kernel bandwidth value. Next, in order to address the communication burden problem in multi-sensor networks, where a leader and a follower are distinguished, a distributed algorithm is constructed to achieve an average consensus among these sensors, called leader-follower average consensus (LFAC). Additionally, the convergence proof of the average consensus algorithm and the computational complexity analysis of the AMEEF-DCKF algorithm are also presented. Finally, through a 10-node sensor network, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in estimating the state of the power system and navigating land vehicles in complex environments."}

Given the site-specific spatio-temporal variations of the mm-wave channel, non-RF sensor inputs and environment awareness can be leveraged to greatly enhance beam management decisions, e.g. via machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the current literature lacks open platforms to gather datasets for the training of such ML techniques and to evaluate novel beam management approaches in real-time, real-world scenarios and full-stack endto-end networks. In this work, we present our SDR-based experimental platform based on OpenAirInterface and are the first to integrate popular low-cost antenna array transceivers, beam sweeping capabilities, and a highly-modular sensor framework and associated interfaces into such a full-stack experimental platform.

In this work, we investigate the non-linear Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) for modeling the underlying energy dynamics of EEG in three representative tasks: motor imagery, emotion recognition, and epilepsy detection. To accommodate the narrowband nature of the operator, we employ Gabor filterbanks to isolate canonical frequency bands, followed by the Energy Separation Algorithm to decompose the TKEO output into amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency components. We then derive a set of energy descriptors based on this demodulation and compare their classification performance against established signal energy and power spectrum features. TKEO features outperform the respective baselines in motor imagery and epilepsy detection, whereas they perform on par in emotion recognition. Our findings suggest that the proposed TKEO-based pipeline provides an intuitive framework for extracting EEG signal dynamics."}

By adapting a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation for the correlated FAS ports, we derive new analytical expressions for the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio statistics, namely the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function. Based on these statistics, we present exact integral expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate, and average channel capacity. We further derive new, tractable closed-form solutions for the average bit error rate and capacity for the practical dual-rank, independent but non-identically distributed case. Finally, a key asymptotic analysis reveals that the system achieves a multiplicative diversity order of $G_d = M \\times d$, which is precisely the product of the FAS spatial rank $M$ and the intrinsic channel diversity order $d$.

The densities for Bayesian transfer learning are approximated with the sum of weighted particles to improve the tracking performance of the primary sensor, which experiences a higher noise intensity compared to the source sensor. We present simulation results that validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to an isolated particle filter and transfer learning applied to the unscented Kalman filter and the cubature Kalman filter. Furthermore, increasing the number of particles shows an improvement in the performance of transfer learning applied to the particle filter with a higher rate compared to the isolated particle filter. However, increasing the number of particles raises computational time per step. Moreover, the performance gain from incorporating Bayesian transfer learning is approximately linearly proportional to the absolute difference value between the noise intensities of the sensors in the dual-tracking system."}
