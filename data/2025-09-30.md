### [1] [The Service Rate Region of Hamming Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22898)
*Priyanka Choudhary,Maheshanand Bhaintwal*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了系统汉明码的服务速率区域，利用超图理论推导了单个数据对象最大可达到服务速率的界限，并探讨了这些界限的可实现性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究编码分布式存储系统的服务速率区域，即容量约束下所有可达到的数据访问请求集合，以理解系统汉明码的性能极限。

Method: 使用超图理论分析系统汉明码的服务速率区域，推导系统节点子集索引的数据符号服务速率之和的上界，并探索这些上界的可实现性。

Result: 建立了系统二进制汉明码中系统节点子集索引的数据符号服务速率之和的上界；对于非系统二进制汉明码，发现聚合服务速率受限于关联生成矩阵中奇数列的数量。

Conclusion: 系统汉明码的服务速率区域可以通过超图理论有效分析，且存在明确的上界限制；非系统汉明码的聚合服务速率受生成矩阵结构特性的约束。

Abstract: The service rate region of a coded distributed storage system is the set of
all achievable data access requests under the capacity constraints. This paper
investigates the service rate regions of systematic Hamming codes using
hypergraph theory and derives bounds for the maximal achievable service rate of
individual data objects. We establish upper bounds on the sum of service rates
of data symbols indexed by a subset of systematic nodes in a systematic binary
Hamming code, and explore the achievability of these bounds. Additionally, for
non-systematic binary Hamming codes, we conclude that the aggregate service
rate is limited by the number of columns of odd weight in the associated
generator matrix.

### [2] [Multihead Finite-State Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22912)
*Xiang Huang,Xiaoyuan Li,Jack H. Lutz,Neil Lutz*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了多头有限状态维度，扩展了有限状态维度概念，通过多个有限状态智能体（头）协作让领导者对无限数据流进行投注，证明了随着头数量增加存在严格的层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展有限状态维度的概念，研究多个有限状态智能体协作时的计算能力，探索多头有限状态赌博机的收益能力层次。

Method: 使用多头有限状态赌博机模型，其中多个有限状态头按照单向移动规则报告符号，领导者基于这些信息对后续符号进行投注，通过gales投注策略量化资本增长速率。

Result: 证明了随着头数量增加存在严格层次结构，给出了明确序列族分离不同头数的赌博机收益能力；多头有限状态维度在有限并集下稳定，但固定头数大于1的预维度缺乏稳定性。

Conclusion: 多头有限状态维度是有限状态维度的有效推广，揭示了多头协作的计算能力层次，为理解有限状态计算的复杂性提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce multihead finite-state dimension, a generalization of
finite-state dimension in which a group of finite-state agents (the heads) with
oblivious, one-way movement rules, each reporting only one symbol at a time,
enable their leader to bet on subsequent symbols in an infinite data stream. In
aggregate, such a scheme constitutes an $h$-head finite state gambler whose
maximum achievable growth rate of capital in this task, quantified using
betting strategies called gales, determines the multihead finite-state
dimension of the sequence. The 1-head case is equivalent to finite-state
dimension as defined by Dai, Lathrop, Lutz and Mayordomo (2004). In our main
theorem, we prove a strict hierarchy as the number of heads increases, giving
an explicit sequence family that separates, for each positive integer $h$, the
earning power of $h$-head finite-state gamblers from that of $(h+1)$-head
finite-state gamblers. We prove that multihead finite-state dimension is stable
under finite unions but that the corresponding quantity for any fixed number
$h>1$ of heads--the $h$-head finite-state predimension--lacks this stability
property.

### [3] [Zigzag Codes Revisited: From Optimal Rebuilding to Small Skip Cost and Small Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23090)
*Wenqin Zhang,Han Mao Kiah,Son Hoang Dau*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文重新研究了zigzag阵列码，通过使用特征为2的域和Z_2^m群索引，实现了小域大小和低跳过成本，同时保持了MDS属性、最优访问和最优重建比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有zigzag码在域大小和跳过成本方面存在限制，需要使其在理论和实践中更加灵活实用，适应现代分布式存储系统的需求。

Method: 采用特征为2的域和Z_2^m群索引，引入排序-子群框架，构建具有修复传输方案、有界跳过成本和低修复碎片率的编码。

Result: 构建了零跳过成本且码率接近2/3的编码族，以及有界跳过成本且码率接近3/4和4/5的编码族，这些码率与实践中广泛部署的MDS阵列码相当。

Conclusion: zigzag码可以在保持最优性能的同时，实现小域大小和低跳过成本，使其在理论和实践中更加灵活实用。

Abstract: We revisit zigzag array codes, a family of MDS codes known for achieving
optimal access and optimal rebuilding ratio in single-node repair. In this
work, we endow zigzag codes with two new properties: small field size and low
skip cost. First, we prove that when the row-indexing group is $\mathcal{G} =
\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ and the field has characteristic two, explicit coefficients
over any field with $|\mathcal{F}|\ge N$ guarantee the MDS property, thereby
decoupling the dependence among $p$, $k$, and $M$. Second, we introduce an
ordering-and-subgroup framework that yields repair-by-transfer schemes with
bounded skip cost and low repair-fragmentation ratio (RFR), while preserving
optimal access and optimal rebuilding ratio. Our explicit constructions include
families with zero skip cost whose rates approach $2/3$, and families with
bounded skip cost whose rates approach $3/4$ and $4/5$. These rates are
comparable to those of MDS array codes widely deployed in practice. Together,
these results demonstrate that zigzag codes can be made both more flexible in
theory and more practical for modern distributed storage systems.

### [4] [RIS- and Multi-Snapshot-Enabled SISO 3D Position and Velocity Estimation With Single Base Station](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23274)
*Yirun Wang,Yongqing Wang,Yuyao Shen,Gongpu Wang,Chintha Tellambura*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在单基站SISO系统中使用可重构智能表面(RIS)进行三维位置和速度联合估计的方法，通过结合RIS部署和多快照利用解决了传统方法的不可行性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在单基站SISO系统中，仅依靠单个RIS或多个快照无法实现三维位置和速度联合估计，需要结合两者来解决这一挑战。

Method: 开发了两阶段方法：首先通过张量分解将复杂的3D联合离开角和多普勒频移估计分解为两个可处理子问题，采用交替优化；然后基于信道参数估计设计低复杂度3D-JPVE方法，包括差分测量的粗估计和原始测量的迭代精炼。

Result: 提出的3D-JPVE方法接近Cramer-Rao下界精度，仿真结果表明估计器具有统计效率，且主动RIS相比被动RIS带来显著的3D-JPVE性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过RIS部署与多快照利用的结合，成功实现了单基站SISO系统中的三维位置和速度联合估计，主动RIS相比被动RIS具有明显性能优势。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) panels can act as cost-effective
anchors for radio localization, complementing conventional base station (BS)
anchors. This paper investigates joint three-dimensional position and velocity
estimation (3D-JPVE) in single-input single-output (SISO) systems with only one
BS available. We first theoretically show that 3D-JPVE is infeasible when
relying solely on a single RIS or on multiple snapshots alone. To address this,
we propose combining RIS deployment with multi-snapshot utilization to enable
realizable 3D-JPVE. A two-stage method is developed for multi-snapshot channel
parameter estimation, comprising a tensor-based coarse estimation step followed
by a maximum likelihood refinement step. In particular, we introduce a
third-order tensor formulation to decompose the challenging 3D joint
angle-of-departure and Doppler shift estimation (3D-JADE) into two tractable
subproblems, which are jointly solved via a low-complexity alternating
optimization approach. Building on the channel parameter estimates, we further
design a two-stage low-complexity method for optimal 3D-JPVE: coarse estimation
is obtained from differential measurements through linear equations, and the
preliminary results are refined iteratively using the original measurements.
Moreover, we derive the closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and show that
the proposed 3D-JPVE method approaches CRLB-level accuracy. Simulation results
confirm the statistical efficiency of the proposed estimators and demonstrate
substantial 3D-JPVE performance gains when deploying active RIS compared to
passive RIS.

### [5] [RIS-Assisted XL-MIMO for Near-Field and Far-Field Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23284)
*Xiaomin Cao,Mohammadali Mohammadi,Hien Quoc Ngo,Hyundong Shin,Michail Matthaiou*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了RIS辅助的XL-MIMO下行系统，为近场和远场用户提供通信服务，提出了三种预编码方案和两阶段相位设计算法，显著提升了频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决XL-MIMO系统中远场用户因遮挡而通信困难的问题，通过RIS辅助和优化预编码方案来提升系统性能。

Method: 采用CZF、LZF和MRT三种预编码方案，提出启发式可见区域选择算法降低复杂度，并设计两阶段相位偏移和功率控制算法。

Result: 相比等功率分配和随机相位设计，提出的设计使加权最小频谱效率总和分别提升了31.9%(CZF)、37.8%(LZF)和119.2%(MRT)。

Conclusion: CZF性能最佳，LZF复杂度较低且性能相当，LZF在优先考虑特定用户组时表现优异，而CZF在用户组间提供更平衡的性能。

Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted extremely
large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) downlink system, where an
XL-MIMO array serves two groups of single-antennas users, namely near-field
users (NFUEs) and far-field users (FFUEs). FFUEs are subject to blockage, and
their communication is facilitated through the RIS. We consider three precoding
schemes at the XL-MIMO array, namely central zero-forcing (CZF), local
zero-forcing (LZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT). Closed-form
expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of all users are derived for MRT
precoding, while statistical-form expressions are obtained for CZF and LZF
processing. A heuristic visibility region (VR) selection algorithm is also
introduced to help reduce the computational complexity of the precoding scheme.
Furthermore, we devise a two-stage phase shifts design and power control
algorithm to maximize the sum of weighted minimum SE of two groups of users
with CZF, LZF and MRT precoding schemes. The simulation results indicate that,
when equal priority is given to NFUEs and FFUEs, the proposed design improves
the sum of the weighted minimum SE by 31.9\%, 37.8\%, and 119.2\% with CZF,
LZF, and MRT, respectively, compared to the case with equal power allocation
and random phase shifts design. CZF achieves the best performance, while LZF
offers comparable results with lower complexity. When prioritizing NFUEs or
FFUEs, LZF achieves strong performance for the prioritized group, whereas CZF
ensures balanced performance between NFUEs and FFUEs.

### [6] [Absorbing Markov Chain-Based Analysis of Age of Information in Discrete-Time Dual-Queue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23360)
*Yifan Feng,Nail Akar,Zhengchuan Chen,Mehul Motani*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个吸收马尔可夫链来精确建模双队列状态更新系统中的信息年龄，分析了传输冻结对降低平均AoI的显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了及时收集传感信息，部署多个传感器/服务器以获得多样性增益被认为是一种有前景的解决方案。需要精确建模双队列状态更新系统的信息年龄性能。

Method: 构建离散时间吸收马尔可夫链来精确建模具有GAW状态更新、DPH型分布服务时间和传输冻结的双队列系统。分析了多种典型服务时间分布下的冻结效果。

Result: 传输冻结的引入被证明对各种服务时间分布都能显著降低平均AoI。研究了服务时间统计参数和服务器异质性对冻结增益的影响。

Conclusion: 在双队列状态更新系统中引入传输冻结策略能有效降低信息年龄，特别是通过优化冻结策略可以获得显著的AoI降低增益。

Abstract: Status update systems require the timely collection of sensing information
for which deploying multiple sensors/servers to obtain diversity gains is
considered as a promising solution. In this work, we construct an absorbing
Markov chain (AMC) to exactly model Age of Information (AoI) in a discretetime
dual-queue (DTDQ) status update system with generate at will (GAW) status
updates, discrete phase-type (DPH-type) distributed service times and
transmission freezing. Specifically, transmission is frozen for a certain
number of slots following the initiation of a transmission, after which one of
the two servers is allowed to simultaneously sample the monitored physical
process and transmit a status update packet, according to the availabilities
and priorities of the two servers. Based on the discrete-time AMC, we provide
the exact distributions of both AoI and peak AoI (PAoI), enabling the
derivation of arbitrary order moments. In addition, we analytically study the
role of freezing using several typical service time distributions, including
geometric, uniform, and triangular distributions. The introduction of freezing
for DTDQ systems is demonstrated to be significantly beneficial in reducing the
mean AoI for various service time distributions. Additionally, we study the
impact of the statistical parameters of the service times and heterogeneity
between the two servers on the freezing gain, i.e., reduction in mean AoI
attained with optimum freezing policies.

### [7] [Noise-Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for Three Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23407)
*Erkin Yapici,Yusuf Islam Tek,Ertugrul Basar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的三用户噪声域非正交多址接入方案，通过引入相关性作为新维度，在均值和方差之外实现三个用户的同时通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两用户ND-NOMA仅使用均值和方差两个维度，无法支持更多用户同时通信。需要引入新维度来扩展系统容量，为物联网环境提供可扩展的多用户通信方案。

Method: 设计了包含上行和下行链路的三用户ND-NOMA方案，开发了能够解码均值、方差和相关性中嵌入信息的检测器。在Rician衰落信道下进行理论分析和仿真验证。

Result: 系统在保持ND-NOMA低功耗和低复杂度优势的同时，实现了有前景的误码率性能。

Conclusion: 这种新的ND-NOMA设计通过不同维度实现三个用户的同时通信，为噪声域系统和物联网环境中的可扩展多用户通信铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel three-user noise-domain non-orthogonal
multiple access (ND-NOMA) scheme by introducing the correlation as a new
dimension besides mean and variance quantities used in two-user ND-NOMA. The
new three-user ND-NOMA scheme includes both uplink and downlink scenarios, with
detectors designed to decode the information embedded in mean, variance, and
correlation. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results under Rician
fading channels show that the proposed system is capable of achieving promising
bit error rate (BER) performance while preserving the low power and low
complexity advantages of ND-NOMA. This new ND-NOMA design enables simultaneous
communication among three users using different dimensions, paving the way for
scalable multi-user communication in noise-domain systems and in the
Internet-of-things (IoT) environments.

### [8] [Fundamental Limits of Distributed Computing for Linearly Separable Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23447)
*K. K. Krishnan Namboodiri,Elizabath Peter,Derya Malak,Petros Elia*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了分布式线性可分函数计算问题，建立了通信与计算负载的基本权衡关系，提出了基于零空间的任务分配和通信策略，在无子分组假设下达到最优或接近最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式计算中主节点通过多个服务器计算用户请求函数时，如何降低服务器计算负载和通信成本，同时确保所有可能请求函数集的可恢复性。

Method: 提出了基于零空间的联合任务分配和服务器传输设计方法，通过揭示零空间与稀疏矩阵分解之间的对偶关系，将分布式计算问题转化为等效的分解任务。

Result: 建立了任意K和L参数下的基本通信-计算权衡关系，所提策略在无子分组和线性编码假设下被证明是精确最优或与最优解相差不超过3倍。

Conclusion: 通过零空间设计方法实现了任务分配和传输的联合优化，首次将通信成本与一般覆盖设计的覆盖数联系起来，为分布式计算提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of distributed computation of linearly
separable functions, where a master node with access to $K$ datasets, employs
$N$ servers to compute $L$ user-requested functions, each defined over the
datasets. Servers are instructed to compute subfunctions of the datasets and
must communicate computed outputs to the user, who reconstructs the requested
outputs. The central challenge is to reduce the per-server computational load
and the communication cost from servers to the user, while ensuring recovery
for any possible set of $L$ demanded functions.
  We here establish the fundamental communication-computation tradeoffs for
arbitrary $K$ and $L$, through novel task-assignment and communication
strategies that, under the linear-encoding and no-subpacketization assumptions,
are proven to be either exactly optimal or within a factor of three from the
optimum. In contrast to prior approaches that relied on fixed assignments of
tasks -- either disjoint or cyclic assignments -- our key innovation is a
nullspace-based design that jointly governs task assignment and server
transmissions, ensuring exact decodability for all demands, and attaining
optimality over all assignment and delivery methods. To prove this optimality,
we here uncover a duality between nullspaces and sparse matrix factorizations,
enabling us to recast the distributed computing problem as an equivalent
factorization task and derive a sharp information-theoretic converse bound.
Building on this, we establish an additional converse that, for the first time,
links the communication cost to the covering number from the theory of general
covering designs.

### [9] [Post-disaster Max-Min Rate Optimization for Multi-UAV RSMA Network in Obstacle Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23908)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决灾后场景中由于障碍物存在导致通信困难的挑战，需要快速部署无人机基站来提供可靠的应急通信服务。

Method: 采用交替优化方法，结合块坐标下降和逐次凸逼近技术，通过惩罚项处理障碍物约束，迭代求解非凸优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案在最小可达速率方面显著优于基准方法，验证了其有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的RSMA传输方案和无人机基站部署策略能够有效提升灾后应急通信性能，为类似场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission
scheme to maximize the minimum achievable rate among ground users for emergency
communications in post-disaster scenarios with obstacles, with which the
optimal positioning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled base
stations can be achieved timely.To address the resulting non-convex and
intractable optimization problem, we design an alternating optimization
approach. Specifically, we relax obstacle-related constraints using penalty
terms. In each iteration, block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex
approximation (SCA) are applied alternately to obtain locally optimal
solutions, and penalty multipliers are updated to ensure convergence of the
relaxed problem to the original one. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme significantly outperforms benchmark methods in terms of the
minimum achievable rate, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA存储作为大规模长期数据保存方案，插入错误是最常见的错误类型，其中插入符号通常与原始符号相同或互补，且噪声可能导致插入符号随机突变，这给可靠数据恢复带来重大挑战。

Method: 研究一种新的噪声插入信道模型，其中包含无限多个与原始符号相同或互补的符号插入，以及最多一个随机符号插入。

Result: 确定了噪声信道的编码容量，并构建了能够达到该编码容量的渐近最优纠错码。

Conclusion: 提出的编码方案能够有效应对DNA存储中的噪声插入错误，为可靠数据恢复提供了理论保证。

Abstract: DNA storage has emerged as a promising solution for large-scale and long-term
data preservation. Among various error types, insertions are the most frequent
errors occurring in DNA sequences, where the inserted symbol is often identical
or complementary to the original, and in practical implementations, noise can
further cause the inserted symbol to mutate into a random one, which creates
significant challenges to reliable data recovery. In this paper, we investigate
a new noisy insertion channel, where infinitely many insertions of symbols
complement or identical to the original ones and up to one insertion of random
symbol may occur. We determine the coding capacity of the noisy channel and
construct asymptotically optimal error-correcting codes achieving the coding
capacity.

Conclusion: FBL-FAS在有限块长传输场景中具有显著优势，为未来通信网络的大规模连接需求提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Massive connectivity with ultra-low latency and high reliability necessitates
fundamental advances in future communication networks operating under
finite-blocklength (FBL) transmission. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have emerged
as a promising enabler, offering superior spectrum and energy efficiency in
short-packet/FBL scenarios. In this work, by leveraging the simplicity and
accuracy of block-correlation channel modeling, we rigorously bound the
performance limits of FBL-FAS from a statistical perspective, focusing on two
key performance metrics: block error rate (BLER) and outage probability (OP).
Furthermore, we introduce a novel complex-integral simplification method based
on Gauss-Laguerre quadrature, which achieves higher approximation accuracy
compared to existing Taylor-expansion-based approaches. Numerical results
validate the robustness of the proposed analysis and clearly demonstrate the
superiority of FBL-FAS over conventional multiple-antenna systems with fixed
antenna placement.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于预测的零延迟通信系统，利用在线共形预测为语义文本压缩提供失真保证，在保持严格失真约束的同时显著降低比特率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G无线系统的发展需要重新思考经典香农信息理论，转向语义和任务导向的通信范式。智能设备需要在零延迟约束下进行通信，同时保证严格的失真要求。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在零延迟通信中同时保证失真约束和降低比特率的目标，为6G时代的语义通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The development of 6G wireless systems is taking place alongside the
development of increasingly intelligent wireless devices and network nodes. The
changing technological landscape is motivating a rethinking of classical
Shannon information theory that emphasizes semantic and task-oriented
paradigms. In this paper, we study a prediction-powered communication setting,
in which devices, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictors,
communicate under zero-delay constraints with strict distortion guarantees. Two
classes of distortion measures are considered: (i) outage-based metrics,
suitable for tasks tolerating occasional packet losses, such as real-time
control or monitoring; and (ii) bounded distortion metrics, relevant to
semantic-rich tasks like text or video transmission. We propose two zero-delay
compression algorithms leveraging online conformal prediction to provide
per-sequence guarantees on the distortion of reconstructed sequences over
error-free and packet-erasure channels with feedback. For erasure channels, we
introduce a doubly-adaptive conformal update to compensate for channel-induced
errors and derive sufficient conditions on erasure statistics to ensure
distortion constraints. Experiments on semantic text compression validate the
approach, showing significant bit rate reductions while strictly meeting
distortion guarantees compared to state-of-the-art prediction-powered
compression methods.

### [13] [Energy-Efficient Movable Antennas: Mechanical Power Modeling and Performance Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24433)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了可移动天线系统的能效优化问题，提出了考虑机械功耗的功率模型，并开发了联合优化天线位置、移动速度和波束成形的算法，在保证碰撞避免的同时提升能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可移动天线通过局部天线移动提供额外的空间自由度来增强通信性能，但天线驱动器的机械功耗不可忽视，使得能效优化比传统固定位置天线系统更为关键。

Method: 基于电机理论建立了步进电机驱动多天线系统的功耗模型，提出了两层优化框架：内层使用Dinkelbach算法优化波束成形，外层使用顺序更新算法迭代优化天线位置。对于多用户场景，提出了交替优化算法。

Conclusion: 通过合理建模机械功耗并开发有效的优化算法，可移动天线系统能够在考虑实际功耗约束的情况下实现显著的能效提升。

Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) offer additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to
enhance communication performance through local antenna movement. However, to
achieve accurate and fast antenna movement, MA drivers entail non-negligible
mechanical power consumption, rendering energy efficiency (EE) optimization
more critical compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. To
address this issue, we develop a fundamental power consumption model for
stepper motor-driven multi-MA systems based on electric motor theory. Based on
this model, we formulate an EE maximization problem from a multi-MA base
station (BS) to multiple single-FPA users. We aim to jointly optimize the MAs'
positions, moving speeds, and the BS's transmit precoding matrix subject to
collision-avoidance constraints during the multi-MA movements. However, this
problem is difficult to solve. To tackle this challenge, we first reveal that
the collision-avoidance constraints can always be relaxed without loss of
optimality by properly renumbering the MA indices. For the resulting relaxed
problem, we first consider a simplified single-user setup and uncover a hidden
monotonicity of the EE performance with respect to the MAs' moving speeds. To
solve the remaining optimization problem, we develop a two-layer optimization
framework. In the inner layer, the Dinkelbach algorithm is employed to derive
the optimal beamforming solution for any given MA positions. In the outer
layer, a sequential update algorithm is proposed to iteratively refine the MA
positions based on the optimal values obtained from the inner layer. Next, we
proceed to the general multi-user case and propose an alternating optimization
(AO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that despite the additional
mechanical power consumption, the proposed algorithms can outperform both
conventional FPA systems and other existing EE maximization benchmarks

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模线性系统的稀疏解问题，通过分解系统来降低计算复杂度

Result: 在满足相干性条件下算法全局收敛，数值实验显示比主流迭代方法更快更准确地找到稀疏解

Conclusion: 提出的分裂交替算法是寻找线性系统稀疏解的有效方法，计算效率高且收敛性好

Abstract: A class of splitting alternating algorithms is proposed for finding the
sparse solution of linear systems with concatenated orthogonal matrices.
Depending on the number of matrices concatenated, the proposed algorithms are
classified into the two-block splitting alternating algorithm (TSAA) and the
multi-block splitting alternating algorithm (MSAA). These algorithms aim to
decompose a large-scale linear system into two or more coupled subsystems, each
significantly smaller than the original system, and then combine the solutions
of these subsystems to produce the sparse solution of the original system. The
proposed algorithms only involve matrix-vector products and reduced orthogonal
projections. It turns out that the proposed algorithms are globally convergent
to the sparse solution of a linear system if the matrix (along with the
sparsity level of the solution) satisfies a coherence-type condition. Numerical
experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms are very promising and can
quickly and accurately locate the sparse solution of a linear system with
significantly fewer iterations than several mainstream iterative methods.

### [15] [On the Performance of Amplitude-Based Models for Low-Rank Matrix Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24699)
*Huanmin Ge,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了低秩相位恢复问题，提出了基于秩约束和非凸最小二乘的模型，证明了在高斯测量条件下，当测量数足够时，重构误差与噪声水平成正比且误差界是紧的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相位恢复和低秩矩阵恢复是信号处理中的重要问题，但现有研究多关注单一问题。本文旨在统一处理低秩相位恢复问题，即从噪声幅度测量中恢复低秩矩阵。

Method: 首先使用秩约束非线性最小二乘模型，然后松弛为核范数约束的Lasso模型（包括约束和无约束版本），并引入了强限制等距性质(SRIP)来分析这些模型。

Result: 证明了在高斯测量条件下，当测量数p ≳ (m+n)r时，重构误差满足min{‖X̂-X₀‖_F, ‖X̂+X₀‖_F} ≲ ‖η‖_2/√p，且该误差界是紧的。对核范数约束模型也建立了类似的理论保证。

Conclusion: 本文为低秩相位恢复问题提供了统一的理论框架，扩展了相位恢复和低秩矩阵恢复的现有结果，证明了所提模型在适当条件下具有最优的重构性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on low-rank phase retrieval, which aims to
reconstruct a matrix $\mathbf{X}_0\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ with ${\mathrm{
rank}}(\mathbf{X}_0)\le r$ from noise-corrupted amplitude measurements
$\mathbf{y}=|\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{X}_0)|+\boldsymbol{\eta}$, where
$\mathcal{A}:\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is a linear map
and $\boldsymbol{\eta}\in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the noise vector. We first examine
the rank-constrained nonlinear least-squares model $\hat{\mathbf{X}}\in
\mathop{\mathrm{argmin}}\limits_{\substack{\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times
m},\mathrm{rank}(\mathbf{X})\le
r}}\||\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{X})|-\mathbf{y}\|_2^2$ to estimate $\mathbf{X}_0$,
and demonstrate that the reconstruction error satisfies
$\min\{\|\hat{\mathbf{X}}-\mathbf{X}_0\|_F,
\|\hat{\mathbf{X}}+\mathbf{X}_0\|_F\}\lesssim
\frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$ with high probability, provided
$\mathcal{A}$ is a Gaussian measurement ensemble and $p\gtrsim (m+n)r$. We also
prove that the error bound $\frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$ is tight
up to a constant. Furthermore, we relax the rank constraint to a nuclear-norm
constraint. Hence, we propose the Lasso model for low-rank phase retrieval,
i.e., the constrained nuclear-norm model and the unconstrained version. We also
establish comparable theoretical guarantees for these models. To achieve this,
we introduce a strong restricted isometry property (SRIP) for the linear map
$\mathcal{A}$, analogous to the strong RIP in phase retrieval. This work
provides a unified treatment that extends existing results in both phase
retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery from rank-one measurements.

the error probability of a simple bounded distance decoding (BDD) for BCH
codes. However, BDD falls short in many applications. In this work, we consider
error-and-erasure decoding and its variants that improve upon BDD. We derive
closed-form expressions for their error probabilities and validate them through
simulations. Then, we illustrate their use in assessing concatenated coding
schemes.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了流体可重构智能表面(FRIS)辅助的无线通信系统的保密性能，通过推导保密中断概率和平均保密容量的上下界，证明FRIS在空间相关性下能有效实现安全通信，且性能优于传统RIS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RIS具有固定几何结构，而FRIS能够根据实时信道条件动态选择反射元件子集，提供更强的空间多样性和适应性，这激发了研究FRIS在安全通信中性能的需求。

Method: 建立了一个安全下行链路场景模型，其中基站与合法用户在窃听者存在的情况下通信，传播由具有有限ON状态元件的FRIS辅助。在空间相关性下推导了保密中断概率(SOP)的下界和平均保密容量(ASC)的上界。

Conclusion: FRIS在空间相关性下能有效实现安全通信，其动态元件选择机制提供了比传统RIS更好的保密性能。

Abstract: This letter investigates the secrecy performance of wireless communication
systems assisted by a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS). Unlike
conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed geometries,
FRISs dynamically select a subset of reflective elements based on real-time
channel conditions, offering enhanced spatial diversity and adaptability. Using
this foundation, we model a secure downlink scenario where a base station
communicates with a legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper, and the
propagation is assisted by a FRIS with a limited number of elements set to the
ON state. We analyze the system's secrecy performance under spatial correlation
by deriving analytical lower and upper bounds for the secrecy outage
probability (SOP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC), respectively. Our results
demonstrate that FRIS effectively enables secure communication under spatial
correlation. Even with partial activation, FRIS significantly outperforms
conventional RISs in enhancing secrecy performance under varying deployment
densities and element correlations.

Result: 在点对点MIMO、多用户MISO和多用户MIMO等多种场景下的仿真表明，所提方法优于传统设计

Conclusion: 该方法在毫米波系统波束成形优化中表现出有效性和通用性

Abstract: Hybrid digital and analog beamforming is a highly effective technique for
implementing beamforming methods in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. It
provides a viable solution to replace the complex fully digital beamforming
techniques. However, the current design of precoding and combining matrices in
hybrid beamforming solely relies on the channel information, neglecting the
crucial consideration of the structure of covariance matrices of the transmit
signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of
hybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is
centered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted
signals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system
by achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix. We tackle the
non-convex nature of this problem by leveraging the dual relationship between
the broadcast channel (BC) and the multiple access channel (MAC). Through
extensive simulations in various scenarios, including point-to-point
multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multi-user (MU) multi-input single-output
(MISO), and MU-MIMO, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
traditional designs. These results highlight the effectiveness and versatility
of our approach in optimizing beamforming for mmWave systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无线网络为人类用户优化频谱效率，但无法满足机器类型通信(MTC)的需求。大量设备具有突发性短包流量模式，现有网络的基于授权的多址接入程序导致显著延迟和低效率。

Method: 提出无源随机接入(URA)范式，假设设备共享共同编码器，从而简化接收过程并消除识别程序。URA将随机接入视为编码问题，同时考虑媒体接入协议和物理层效应。

Result: URA范式解决了计算挑战，并为MTC提供了更有效的接入方案。

Conclusion: URA是解决机器类型通信中大量设备突发短包传输问题的有前景方法，将随机接入重新定义为编码问题。

Abstract: Current wireless networks are designed to optimize spectral efficiency for
human users, who typically require sustained connections for high-data-rate
applications like file transfers and video streaming. However, these networks
are increasingly inadequate for the emerging era of machine-type communications
(MTC). With a vast number of devices exhibiting sporadic traffic patterns
consisting of short packets, the grant-based multiple access procedures
utilized by existing networks lead to significant delays and inefficiencies. To
address this issue the unsourced random access (URA) paradigm has been
proposed. This paradigm assumes the devices to share a common encoder thus
simplifying the reception process by eliminating the identification procedure.
The URA paradigm not only addresses the computational challenges but it also
considers the random access (RA) as a coding problem, i.e., takes into account
both medium access protocols and physical layer effects. In this monograph we
provide a comprehensive overview of the URA problem in noisy channels, with the
main task being to explain the major ideas rather than to list all existing
solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合生成建模、滑动窗口处理和决策融合的电力系统事件检测与分类框架，能够识别已知事件并将未知扰动分类为新类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有限的标注数据集，难以泛化到罕见或未见过的电力系统扰动，需要更鲁棒的事件检测和分类方法。

Method: 使用变分自编码器-生成对抗网络建模正常运行状态，提取重构误差和判别器误差作为异常指标；开发阈值法和凸包法两种决策策略；通过滑动窗口机制构建时空检测和分类矩阵；集成多个PMU输出进行决策融合。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法达到最先进的准确率，超越了机器学习、深度学习和基于包络线的基准方法，并能有效识别未知事件。

Conclusion: 该框架具有适应性和实用价值，能够解决监督分类器的关键限制，适用于现代电力系统的广域事件分析。

Abstract: Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for
maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often
depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize
to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that
integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and
decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using
synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is
employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error
and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary
decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational
efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error
distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and
classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an
identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs.
This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically
classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a
key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and
envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further
highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for
wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的睡眠分期方法，将一维PSG信号转换为二维波形图像，然后微调多模态大模型来学习这些表示，模仿临床诊断实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动睡眠分期方法通常从复杂的PSG信号中提取特征并训练领域特定模型，缺乏直观性且需要大量专业数据集。

Method: 将原始一维PSG时间序列转换为直观的二维波形图像，然后微调多模态大模型来学习这些表示。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法使通用模型无需事先接触睡眠数据即可获得稳健的分期能力，且性能优于现有最先进基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于现有方法，突出了其在医疗应用中的效率和实用价值。

Abstract: Sleep staging is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders and assessing
neurological health. Existing automatic methods typically extract features from
complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which
often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages
large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic
practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into
intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large
model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets
(ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose
models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging
capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic
the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG
images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for
medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG
image dataset will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi基于RSS的室内定位方法虽然广泛适用，但RSS对多径、信道变化和接收器特性高度敏感。监督学习方法需要大量标注数据，收集成本高昂。

Method: 使用一次性校准的顶置摄像头跟踪设备，收集附近接入点广播包的RSS数据，自动生成(x, y, RSS)数据集来训练移动可部署的定位算法。

Result: 在实验中量化了视觉辅助RSS数据收集的精度限制，并在不同信号条件和设备类型下对传统和监督学习方法进行基准测试，显示出改进的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际应用提供了实用工具，所有代码、工具和数据集均已开源发布。

Abstract: Wi-Fi-based positioning promises a scalable and privacy-preserving solution
for location-based services in indoor environments such as malls, airports, and
campuses. RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on
all Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel
variations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods
offer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is
often costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this
by automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a
short, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only
once with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from
broadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting
(x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable
localization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video
monitoring. We quantify the accuracy limits of such vision-assisted RSS data
collection under key factors such as tracking precision and label
synchronization. Using the collected experimental data, we benchmark
traditional and supervised learning approaches under varying signal conditions
and device types, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization,
validating the utility of the proposed framework for practical use. All code,
tools, and datasets are released as open source.

TL;DR: 提出了非均匀Stockwell变换(NUST)，一种直接处理非均匀采样数据的时频分析方法，解决了传统方法对瞬态事件不敏感或需要插值的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非均匀采样数据中的非平稳信号分析具有挑战性，传统方法如广义Lomb-Scargle周期图对瞬态事件不敏感，而现有时频方法依赖固定窗口或插值，对非均匀数据效果不佳。

Method: NUST采用双重自适应窗口，根据频率和局部数据密度调整窗口宽度，直接对非均匀采样数据进行局部密度自适应谱分析。

Result: 在多个非均匀采样合成信号上验证了NUST的优越时域定位性能，相比GLS方法表现更好。应用于HD 10180多行星系统的HARPS径向速度数据，成功区分了相干行星信号和恒星活动。

Conclusion: NUST为分析非均匀采样数据中的瞬态和持续信号提供了有效的时频分析框架，在行星探测等应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: The analysis of non-stationary signals in non-uniformly sampled data is a
challenging task. Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle
(GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent
periodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing
time-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation,
which can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform
Stockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized
density adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST
employs a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency
and local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both
transient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous
non-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior
time-localization performance compared to GLS. Furthermore, we apply NUST to
HARPS radial velocity data of the multi-planetary system HD 10180, successfully
distinguishing coherent planetary signals from stellar activity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决协作多频段网络中用户关联、混合波束成形和移动用户切换等复杂优化问题，需要开发一个能够处理非凸优化问题的综合框架。

Method: 使用分数规划和主化-最小化技术提出迭代算法解决非凸优化问题；对于移动用户，提出两种切换感知的资源分配方法，利用Jensen不等式和对数函数特性将非凸问题近似为凸问题求解。

Result: 数值结果表明所提算法有效，协作UMB/THz网络优于独立THz网络，近场建模在极大天线阵列中至关重要，切换感知方法能有效减轻切换影响。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和算法能够有效优化协作多频段网络性能，特别是在处理移动用户切换和近场效应方面表现出色。

Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework to investigate and optimize the
downlink performance of cooperative multi-band networks (MBNs) operating on
upper mid-band (UMB) and terahertz (THz) frequencies, where base stations (BSs)
in each band cooperatively serve users. The framework captures sophisticated
features such as near-field channel modeling, fully and partially connected
antenna architectures, and users' mobility. First, we consider joint user
association and hybrid beamforming optimization to maximize the system
sum-rate, subject to power constraints, maximum cluster size of cooperating
BSs, and users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By leveraging fractional
programming FP and majorization-minimization techniques, an iterative algorithm
is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem. We then consider
handover (HO)-aware resource allocation for moving users in a cooperative
UMB/THz MBN. Two HO-aware resource allocation methods are proposed. The first
method focuses on maximizing the HO-aware system sum-rate subject to HO-aware
QoS constraints. Using Jensen's inequality and properties of logarithmic
functions, the non-convex optimization problem is tightly approximated with a
convex one and solved. The second method addresses a multi-objective
optimization problem to maximize the system sum-rate, while minimizing the
total number of HOs. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
algorithms, cooperative UMB/THz MBN over stand-alone THz networks, as well as
the critical importance of accurate near-field modeling in extremely large
antenna arrays. Moreover, the proposed HO-aware resource allocation methods
effectively mitigate the impact of HOs, enhancing performance in the considered
system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ISAC系统中，感知与通信竞争资源，传统联合优化方法忽视了这种权衡，导致通信需求增加时波束模式重塑可能降低DoA感知精度。

Method: 将感知问题分解为两个子问题，提出SGCDF波束模式设计，利用Riemannian流形优化和凸闭集投影开发低复杂度版本。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相比传统联合优化策略，所提方法通过保持波束模式提高了多目标估计精度，低复杂度版本在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 提出的分解方法和低复杂度优化策略有效平衡了ISAC系统中感知与通信的性能，提供了优越的性能-复杂度权衡。

Abstract: We investigate the beampattern design problem for mono-static multi-user (MU)
multi-point-target integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where a
dual-function multiple-input multiple-output (DF-MIMO) base station (BS)
performs downlink communication and radar sensing simultaneously. In ISAC
systems, sensing and communication inherently compete for resources. As
communication demand increases, the beam pattern is reshaped, which might
degrade the direction of arrival (DoA) sensing accuracy, measured in terms of
mean-squared error (MSE) and lower-bounded by the Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB). Since conventional joint formulations of the sensing-based problem
often overlook this trade-off, our work addresses it by decomposing the
sensing-based problem into two subproblems (SPs). This decomposition enables a
more effective exploitation of the beam pattern's physical properties, which we
refer to as the Sensing-Guided Communication Dual-Function (SGCDF) beam pattern
design. We further develop a low-complexity extension using the Riemannian
Manifold Optimization (RMO) and convex closed-set projection. Simulation
results confirm that the proposed method improves multi-target estimation
accuracy, compared to traditional joint optimization strategies, by preserving
the beam pattern, while the low-complexity version offers an excellent
performance-complexity tradeoff, maintaining high accuracy with significantly
reduced computational cost.

Motivation: 6G蜂窝网络的技术创新带来了前所未有的用户设备定位能力，但也引发了物理层位置隐私的严重担忧。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法能够欺骗基站，诱导显著定位误差，而对链路容量的影响取决于欺骗的位置。

Conclusion: HoloTrace被确立为未来6G网络的实用且鲁棒的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: The technological innovation towards 6G cellular networks introduces
unprecedented capabilities for user equipment (UE) localization, but it also
raises serious concerns about physical layer location privacy. This paper
introduces HoloTrace, a signal-level privacy preservation framework that relies
on user-side spoofing of localization-relevant features to prevent the
extraction of precise location information from the signals received by a base
station (BS) in a mmWave MIMO-OFDM system. Spoofing is performed by the user on
location parameters such as angle of arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD),
and time difference of arrival (TDoA). Without requiring any protocol
modification nor network-side support, our method strategically perturbs pilot
transmissions to prevent a BS from performing non-consensual UE localization.
The methodology allows the UE to spoof its position, keeping the precoder
unchanged. We formulate spoofing as a unified rank-constrained projection
problem, and provide closed-form solutions under varying levels of channel
state information (CSI) at the UE, including scenarios with and without CSI
knowledge. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach enables the UE
to deceive the BS, inducing significant localization errors, while the impact
on link capacity varies depending on the spoofed position. Our findings
establish HoloTrace as a practical and robust privacy-preserving solution for
future 6G networks.

Abstract: A new brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, deployed through minimally
invasive surgery, is changing the way we think about treating severe
neurological conditions. The central idea is to place a device called Stentrode
in the brain's vasculature, which enables neuromodulation and helps patients
regain the ability to communicate. However, in such devices, the battery and
electronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In
these cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be
of great interest. ME antennas offer significant advantages over traditional
antennas, leveraging acoustic resonance rather than electromagnetic resonance
to achieve a size reduction of up to five orders of magnitude. In addition to
their compactness and immunity to ground-plane interference, ME antennas could
be adopted for use in vascular implants, such as coronary stents, potentially
enabling minimally invasive monitoring and communication. Despite these
advantages, a single antenna embedded in the implant may be constrained by the
limited volume of magnetostrictive material, which could result in low output
gain. To address this gain limitation, we propose using antenna arrays designed
to produce constructive interference at a designated far-field point, ideally
located outside the patient, to enhance signal transmission and receiving
capabilities. We develop a mathematical model to represent the antennas and
optimize their spatial arrangement and phase synchronization. Simulations based
on this model demonstrate promising high-gain performance at the prescribed
far-field location through phase manipulation.

Abstract: Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) sampling techniques provide efficient
frameworks for reconstructing signals with inherent sparsity at rates below
Nyquist. However, traditional FRI reconstruction methods rely heavily on
pre-defined kernels, often limiting hardware implementation and reconstruction
accuracy under noisy conditions. In this paper, we propose a robust, flexible,
and practically implementable framework for FRI reconstruction by introducing
novel learnable kernel strategies. First, we demonstrate effective
reconstruction using known, fixed kernels such as truncated Gaussian and
Gaussian pair kernels, which mitigate the requirement that the samples should
have a sum-of-exponentials (SoE) form. Next, we extend this concept by jointly
optimizing both the sampling kernel and reconstruction encoder through a
unified learning approach, yielding adaptive kernels that significantly
outperform traditional methods in resolution and noise robustness, with reduced
sampling rates. Furthermore, we propose a practical hardware realization by
representing kernels as sums of two exponential decay signals with jointly
optimized poles, facilitating compact, efficient analog implementations. Our
approach is validated experimentally through hardware implementations using a
unity-gain Sallen-Key analog filter, achieving accurate real-world signal
recovery. The developed convolutional neural network-based encoder
substantially reduces computational complexity, demonstrating competitive
performance with fewer parameters, making our method particularly suitable for
resource-constrained, edge-based deployments.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a key enabler for
next-generation applications such as smart cities and autonomous systems. Its
integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) unlocks new potentials for
reliable communication and precise sensing in dynamic aerial environments.
However, existing research predominantly treats UAVs as aerial base stations,
overlooking their role as ISAC users, and fails to leverage large-scale antenna
arrays at terrestrial base stations to enhance security and spectral
efficiency. This paper propose a secure and spectral efficient ISAC framework
for multi-UAV networks, and a two-stage optimization approach is developed to
jointly design hybrid beamforming (HBF), artificial noise (AN) injection, and
UAV trajectories. Aiming at maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the first stage
employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize digital beamformers and
trajectories, and the second stage decomposes the digital solution into analog
and digital components via low-complexity matrix factorization. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to
benchmark schemes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于期望传播的重叠块分区检测器(OvEP)，用于解决大规模MIMO系统中高度相关信道矩阵导致的检测性能下降问题，通过重叠块分区和LMMSE滤波器的设计，在降低计算复杂度的同时保持接近传统LMMSE-EP的性能。

Motivation: 大规模MIMO系统在密集阵列部署和有限散射环境下会产生高度相关且病态的信道矩阵，这会严重降低基于消息传递的检测器性能。

Result: 所提算法在数值模拟中表现出理论预测的性能提升，实现了接近传统LMMSE-EP的性能，但计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: OvEP算法通过重叠块分区结构有效缓解了高空间相关性带来的块间相关性影响，在保持检测性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，其固定点理论上对应于松弛KL最小化问题的驻点。

Abstract: Large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems typically operate
in dense array deployments with limited scattering environments, leading to
highly correlated and ill-conditioned channel matrices that severely degrade
the performance of message-passing-based detectors. To tackle this issue, this
paper proposes an expectation propagation (EP)-based detector, termed
overlapping block partitioning EP (OvEP). In OvEP, the large-scale measurement
vector is partitioned into partially overlapping blocks. For each block and its
overlapping part, a low-complexity linear minimum mean square error
(LMMSE)-based filter is designed according to the partitioned structure. The
resulting LMMSE outputs are then combined to generate the input to the
denoiser. In this combining process, subtracting the overlapping-part outputs
from the block outputs effectively mitigates the adverse effects of inter-block
correlation induced by high spatial correlation. The proposed algorithm is
consistently derived within the EP framework, and its fixed point is
theoretically proven to coincide with the stationary point of a relaxed
Kullback- Leibler (KL) minimization problem. The mechanisms underlying the
theoretically predicted performance improvement are further clarified through
numerical simulations. The proposed algorithm achieves performance close to
conventional LMMSE-EP with lower computational complexity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线特定发射器识别（OSEI）任务，解决传统SEI方法无法识别未见发射器的问题。作者开发了基于哈希的CASH模型，通过两步骤识别过程，在真实信号数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中需要识别来自未见发射器的信号，而现有模型偏向于已见发射器分布，难以在线识别新发射器。

Method: 提出CASH模型，包含两个步骤：已见发射器识别步骤确定信号是否来自已见发射器，信号哈希编码步骤为每个信号样本分配哈希码以识别特定发射器。

Result: 在ADSB和ORACLE数据集上，CASH模型在小样本学习和广义零样本学习任务中分别比现有方法准确率至少提高6.08%和8.55%。

Conclusion: CASH模型为OSEI任务提供了统一解决方案，能够准确在线识别来自已见和未见发射器的信号。

Abstract: Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) has been widely studied, aiming to
distinguish signals from different emitters given training samples from those
emitters. However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from
novel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or
no prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel
emitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To
address these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification
(OSEI) task, comprising both online \revise{few-shot and generalized zero-shot}
learning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen
emitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online
during inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated
Signal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task.
The CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal
encoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is
from seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters
distribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a
hash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental
results on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that
our method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters
online. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08\% and
8.55\% in accuracy for the few-shot and \revise{generalized zero-shot learning
}tasks, respectively. The code will be open-sourced at

Conclusion: 提出的渐近展开方法为非线性滤波提供了一种计算高效且准确的替代方案，特别适用于需要捕捉条件分布复杂特征的场景。

Abstract: We propose a new asymptotic expansion method for nonlinear filtering, based
on a small parameter in the system noise. The conditional expectation is
expanded as a power series in the noise level, with each coefficient computed
by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This approach mitigates
the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in
existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters.
Moreover, by incorporating an Edgeworth-type expansion, our method captures
complex features of the conditional distribution, such as multimodality, with
significantly lower computational cost than conventional filtering algorithms.

Motivation: 6G网络中集成感知与通信的主要挑战在于如何在同一个波形中整合感知和通信两种不同功能，特别是在宽带场景下需要平衡两种性能。

Method: 采用标准OFDM信号，相位用于调制通信消息，功率谱密度用于优化感知性能；提出低复杂度的类注水分配器，具有明确的PSD平坦度约束；揭示了OFDM PSD控制与OTFS波形之间的对偶关系。

Conclusion: 提出的宽带ISAC方案能够有效平衡通信和感知性能，在频率选择性信道中通过PSD控制实现感知性能优化，同时保持通信功能。

Abstract: In integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), a distinguishing feature of
6G wireless networks, the main challenge lies in integrating the two distinct
functions of sensing and communication within the same waveform. In this paper,
the ISAC waveform synthesis is studied in the wideband regime, since a large
bandwidth can simplify the analysis and is justified by the employment of
millimeter wave or higher frequency band. Standard orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling is assumed, and the wideband analysis of
sensing is a counterpart of the existing studies on wideband communications. It
is proposed that the phase over such OFDM subcarriers is for modulating
communication messages while the power spectral density (PSD) is shaped for the
sensing performance. Beyond OFDM, we further reveal a duality between the
proposed PSD-shaping rule and the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)
waveform. Flattening the OTFS delay-axis PSD produces the same integrated
sidelobe level (ISL) reduction effect in the delay-Doppler domain as PSD
control achieves for OFDM in the frequency domain. To balance communication and
sensing performance over frequency-selective channels, we propose a
low-complexity, water-filling-like allocator with an explicit PSD-flatness
(variance) constraint. The performance of the proposed wideband ISAC scheme is
demonstrated using both numerical simulations and hardware experiments.

TL;DR: Uni-NTFM是一个基于神经科学原理设计的统一神经拓扑基础模型，专门用于处理脑电图(EEG)信号。它通过解耦架构并行编码时域、频域和原始信号表示，使用拓扑嵌入机制统一不同国际标准的电极，并采用专家混合神经Transformer来高效扩展模型容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脑基础模型继承了为文本或图像设计的架构，在处理EEG信号时存在三个主要限制：1) 在单一处理流中混淆时域波形模式和频域节律特征；2) 忽略不同标准电极的关键空间拓扑结构；3) 依赖不灵活的密集网络处理功能不同的EEG模式。

Conclusion: Uni-NTFM展示了学习大脑活动通用表示的卓越能力，为EEG信号处理提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated
significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to
electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique
properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures
designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1)
conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic
features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial
topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the
inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological
Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles
to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates
three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time,
frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain
feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes
from different international standards and generate structured input sequences
for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that
efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized
subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B
parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a
dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms
existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct
downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings,
demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain
activity.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), capable of dynamically controlling

promising technology for enhancing signal coverage and improving end-user

An RIS prototype includes one master and up to sixteen slave blocks, each of
which has an identical hardware structure with $8\times 8$ reflecting surface
elements and a controller board. The phase shift response of each unit element
is controlled with a PIN diode to form a $180^\circ$ phase difference between
the ON and OFF states. The measurement experiment using two RIS blocks, horn
antennas, and a vector network analyzer showed that the improvement of the
received signal power is more than $15$ dB across the n78 frequency band for a
given placement.

Abstract: The problem of recovering a mixture of spike signals convolved with distinct
point spread functions (PSFs) lying on a parametric manifold, under the
assumption that the spike locations are known, is studied. The PSF unmixing
problem is formulated as a projected non-linear least squares estimator. A
lower bound on the radius of the region of strong convexity is established in
the presence of noise as a function of the manifold coherence and Lipschitz
properties, guaranteeing convergence and stability of the optimization program.
Numerical experiments highlight the speed of decay of the PSF class in the
problem's conditioning and confirm theoretical findings. Finally, the proposed
estimator is deployed on real-world spectroscopic data from laser-induced
breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), removing the need for manual calibration and
validating the method's practical relevance.

Abstract: Wireless multi-port sensing remotely retrieves the scattering matrix of a
multi-port device under test (DUT) connected to a set of
not-directly-accessible (NDA) antennas that couple over-the-air (OTA) to a set
of accessible antennas. If (i) the OTA fixture characteristics are known, and
(ii) the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas is
sufficient, the OTA fixture can be de-embedded to recover the DUT
characteristics. In recent prior work, we solved (i) by connecting the NDA
antennas to a specific known tunable load network (TLN). Here, we tackle (ii)
by additionally using the TLN to provide measurement diversity. The connection
between OTA fixture and TLN constitutes a programmable fixture (PF). When the
DUT characteristics cannot be identified based on a single PF realization, we
add measurement diversity with multiple PF realizations. The underlying
"multiplexed de-embedding" achieves the joint de-embedding of an ensemble of PF
realizations when a single PF realization cannot be de-embedded. We
experimentally demonstrate our concept by remotely estimating the scattering
matrix of a reciprocal, non-unitary 4-port DUT (10 complex-valued unknowns) via
a rich-scattering OTA fixture purely based on measurements of a single
transmission coefficient between two accessible antennas across 30 different PF
realizations. We systematically study the trade-off between the number of
independent measurements at the accessible antennas and the number of PF
realizations. Multiplexed de-embedding of the OTA fixture paves the path to
implementing wireless multi-port sensing with low hardware complexity in areas
like RFID and wireless bioelectronics.

Abstract: Leveraging received signal strength (RSS) measurements for indoor
localization is highly attractive due to their inherent availability in
ubiquitous wireless protocols. However, prevailing RSS-based methods often
depend on complex computational algorithms or specialized hardware, rendering
them impractical for low-cost access points. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces buffer-aided RMSProp (BARProp), a fast and memory-efficient
localization algorithm specifically designed for RSS-based tasks. The key
innovation of BARProp lies in a novel mechanism that dynamically adapts the
decay factor by monitoring the energy variations of recent gradients stored in
a buffer, thereby achieving both accelerated convergence and enhanced
stability. Furthermore, BARProp requires less than 15% of the memory used by
state-of-the-art methods. Extensive evaluations with real-world data
demonstrate that BARProp not only achieves higher localization accuracy but
also delivers at least a fourfold improvement in convergence speed compared to
existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Optimizing sensor readout schemes and integrated circuit designs for both
open-loop and closed-loop implementations requires precise modeling and
simulation strategies. This study introduces a novel two-port impedance model
to estimate the behavior of a converse Magnetoelectric (cME) sensor. This model
provides a possible framework for calculating transfer functions and simulating
magnetometer behavior in both continuous- and discrete-time simulation
environments, and it is also possibly transferable to other magnetometer types.
Common S-parameters were measured experimentally using an impedance analyzer
and converted to Z-parameters to create a transfer function for system-level
simulations. The model was validated through an analysis of output-related
noise using MATLAB and LTSpice simulations to optimize the noise of the analog
circuit parts of the system. The simulation results were compared with
experimental measurements using a Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier and the
custom-designed low-noise printed circuit board (PCB) under model
considerations. The proposed methodology derives noise considerations and the
transfer function of a magnetometer. These are essential for readout schemes
for mixed-signal circuit design. This allows low-noise electronics to be
designed and extended to other sensor interface electronics, broadening their
applicability in high-performance magnetic sensing.

Abstract: Extensive monitoring systems generate data that is usually compressed for
network transmission. This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud
for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially
impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular
patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic
framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the
three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the
effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the
distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous
signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on
a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying
on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can
be distinguished from each other.

TL;DR: 本文研究了毫米波MIMO系统中使用可重构智能表面(RIS)增强传输性能的预编码设计，提出使用深度神经网络(DNN)代替传统穷举搜索来降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统穷举搜索在连续相位偏移中寻找最优码字计算量大且耗时，需要更高效的码字选择方法。

Method: 采用训练好的深度神经网络(DNN)进行码字选择，替代计算密集型的穷举搜索方法。

Result: 仿真结果显示DNN在测试阶段即使终端用户与RIS之间距离变化时，仍能保持次优的频谱效率。

Conclusion: DNN在推进RIS辅助系统方面具有巨大潜力，能够有效降低计算复杂度并保持良好的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的框架，结合抛物线波方程信道建模、条件生成对抗网络数据增强和决斗深度Q网络，用于优化隧道中接入点的部署位置，提高无线覆盖质量。

Method: 使用PWE方法生成部分AP位置的高保真路径损耗分布，通过cGAN扩展到所有候选位置，然后采用Dueling DQN进行AP位置优化，状态空间捕获AP位置和覆盖情况，动作空间定义AP调整，奖励函数鼓励信号改善并惩罚部署成本。

Conclusion: 该工作集成了高保真电磁仿真、生成建模和AI驱动优化，为复杂隧道环境中的下一代CBTC系统提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control
(CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is
critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical
model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement
requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches
often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave
equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network
(cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for
AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss
distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN
to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions,
significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In
the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the
action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal
improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances
convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the
likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show
that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and
traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received
power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This
work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling,
and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for
next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多载波连续孔径阵列系统的低复杂度接收机设计，基于高斯置信传播框架，在双弥散信道下显著提升性能并保持低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对多载波连续孔径阵列系统在双弥散信道下的检测问题，需要设计既能提升性能又保持低计算复杂度的接收机方案。

Method: 采用基于高斯置信传播的框架，仅使用元素级标量运算来检测传输符号，适用于OFDM、OTFS和AFDM等多种波形。

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比传统离散天线阵列系统，在未编码误码率方面获得显著性能提升，同时保持非常低的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 所提出的接收机设计为多载波连续孔径阵列系统提供了一种高效且低复杂度的解决方案，在双弥散信道下具有优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel low-complexity receiver design for multicarrier continuous
aperture array (CAPA) systems operating over doubly-dispersive (DD) channels.
The receiver leverages a Gaussian Belief Propagation (GaBP)-based framework
that hinges only on element-wise scalar operations for the detection of the
transmitted symbols. Simulation results for the orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine
frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveforms demonstrate significant
performance improvements in terms of uncoded bit error rate (BER) compared to
conventional discrete antenna array systems, while maintaining very low
computational complexity.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 对8个ECG基础模型在26个临床任务上进行基准测试，发现模型性能存在领域差异：在成人ECG解读领域表现良好，但在其他领域大多未能超越监督学习，只有ECG-CPC模型表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG机器学习应用目前存在碎片化问题，基础模型虽然具有广泛适应性潜力，但其在多样化ECG任务上的泛化能力尚不明确。

Method: 使用12个公共数据集（包含1,650个回归和分类目标），在微调和冻结设置下评估8个ECG基础模型，并进行数据集规模的缩放分析。

Result: 三个基础模型在成人ECG解读领域持续优于强监督基线；ECG-CPC在其他类别中表现优异，而大多数基础模型未能超越监督学习；基础模型在不同数据集规模下显示出不同的缩放行为。

Conclusion: 基础模型在成人ECG分析中显示出潜力，但在心脏结构、结果预测和患者特征化方面仍存在显著差距。ECG-CPC的优异表现表明ECG基础模型仍有未开发的改进机会。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a long-standing diagnostic tool. Yet
machine learning for ECG interpretation remains fragmented, often limited to
narrow tasks or datasets. Foundation models promise broader adaptability, but
their generalization across diverse ECG tasks is not well understood. We
benchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using
12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets.
Models were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling
analyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across
domains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three
foundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In
contrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB,
dominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass
supervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling
behaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical
applications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG
analysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and
patient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being
orders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources
highlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models.
