Conclusion: 在基站和IRS上使用可移动组件是缓解太赫兹宽带通信双波束偏移效应的有效方法

Abstract: In this paper, we study employing movable components on both base station
(BS) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in a wideband terahertz (THz)
multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system, where the BS is equipped with a
movable antenna (MA) array and the IRS consists of movable subarrays. To
alleviate double beam squint effect caused by the coupling of beam squint at
the BS and IRS, we propose to maximize the minimal received power across a wide
THz spectrum by delicately configuring the positions of MAs and IRS subarrays,
which is highly challenging. By adopting majorization-minimization (MM)
methodology, we develop an algorithm to tackle the aforementioned optimization.
Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and
the benefit of utilizing movable components on the BS and IRS to mitigate
double beam squint effect in wideband THz communications.

Abstract: This work presents an analysis of semantic communication in the context of
First-Order Logic (FOL)-based deduction. Specifically, the receiver holds a set
of hypotheses about the State of the World (SotW), while the transmitter has
incomplete evidence about the true SotW but lacks access to the ground truth.
The transmitter aims to communicate limited information to help the receiver
identify the hypothesis most consistent with true SotW. We formulate the
objective as approximating the posterior distribution at the transmitter to the
receiver. Using Stirling's approximation, this reduces to a constrained,
finite-horizon resource allocation problem. Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
conditions yields a truncated water-filling solution. Despite the problem's
non-convexity, symmetry and permutation invariance ensure global optimality.
Based on this, we design message selection strategies, both for single- and
multi-round communication, and model the receiver's inference as an m-ary
Bayesian hypothesis testing problem. Under the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule,
our communication strategy achieves optimal performance within budget
constraints. We further analyze convergence rates and validate the theoretical
findings through experiments, demonstrating reduced error over random selection
and prior methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了算术级可变精度计算(AL-VPC)框架，通过优化每个算术运算的计算精度，在无线通信中实现计算性能与复杂度的平衡，相比传统固定精度方法可提升60%和速率或降低30%复杂度。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算复杂度是无线通信中的重大挑战，现有方法主要通过算法特定途径来降低复杂度，但计算精度这一直接影响计算性能和复杂度的基本维度在文献中很少被探索。

Method: 建立了算术级可变精度计算(AL-VPC)统一框架，开发了基于随机分析的算术传播误差模型，并构建了数学优化问题来平衡计算性能和复杂度。提出了离线VPC和在线VPC两种算法。

Conclusion: 可变精度计算为无线通信系统提供了新的优化维度，通过精确控制每个算术运算的精度，能够显著提升系统性能或降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless
communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through
algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which
directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is
a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the
emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing
(VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a
distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we
establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing
(AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each
arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model
exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization
problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational
complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to
solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a
case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary
between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60%
sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared
to the traditional fixed-length methods.

*Alireza Fadakar,Yuchen Zhang,Hui Chen,Musa Furkan Keskin,Henk Wymeersch,Andreas F. Molisch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 电磁可重构流体天线系统通过动态控制天线辐射模式，在MISO系统中显著提升下行链路定位精度，相比传统非可重构阵列大幅改善UE定位准确性。

Abstract: Electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (ER-FAS) introduce
additional degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain by dynamically
steering per-antenna radiation patterns, thereby enhancing power efficiency in
wireless links. Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which
adjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM
characteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing
studies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores
its application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station
serves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability
paradigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired
beampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state
selection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set
of patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM
precoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case
we derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM
precoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and
propose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern
selection. Analytical bounds and extensive simulations show that the proposed
hybrid designs for ER-FAS substantially improve UE positioning accuracy over
traditional non-reconfigurable arrays.

Abstract: We present a unified receiver processing framework for communication over
delay-scale (DS)-spread channels that arise in underwater acoustic (UWA)
communications that addresses both channel estimation (CE) and data detection
for different modulation waveforms, namely OFDM, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS, through
a common input--output relation. Using this framework, we conduct a fair and
comprehensive comparative study of these waveforms under DS-spread UWA channels
and similar receiver complexities.
  We also develop a novel iterative variational Bayesian (VB) off-grid CE
algorithm to estimate the delay and scale parameters of the channel paths, via
two approaches: a first-order approximation scheme (FVB) and a second-order
approximation scheme (SVB). We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol
detection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios
for the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED)
scheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \emph{virtual} pilots to further
improve the CE and data detection accuracy.
  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE
and data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in
uncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier
equalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while
OFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS
perform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications,
interestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver
is employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is
constrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel
conditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these
differences disappear.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时-顶点图信号模型描述具有不规则结构的时变数据，其联合时-顶点傅里叶谱域的频带限制性反映了时间和图拓扑上的平滑性，需要研究其临界采样理论

Method: 研究三类TVGS（连续时间信号、无限长序列、有限长序列）的临界采样，证明联合频带限制TVGS的采样密度下界，提出采样重建程序

Conclusion: 提出的采样方案可用于数值和真实数据集，为时-顶点图信号的采样理论提供了重要理论基础

Abstract: Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with
irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In
this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including
continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences
in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited
TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which
depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or
sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To
demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and
reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how
the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real
datasets.

### [8] [Subset Random Sampling and Reconstruction of Finite Time-Vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21415)
*Hang Sheng,Qinji Shu,Hui Feng,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对有限时间-顶点图信号的子集随机采样方案，通过在选定的子矩阵内进行随机采样来解决实际应用中采样受限的问题，并提供了理论保证和包含低秩、稀疏性、平滑性先验的重建框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机采样方法允许在任何顶点任何时间采样，但实际应用中采样通常只能限于部分顶点和时刻，需要研究更适合实际限制的采样方案。

Method: 首先随机选择行和列形成子矩阵，然后在子矩阵内进行随机采样；提出了包含低秩、稀疏性、平滑性先验（LSSP）的重建框架。

Result: 提供了高概率重建原始信号的理论充分条件，通过实验验证了重建的可行性和框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的子集随机采样方案能够有效解决实际采样限制问题，结合LSSP重建框架可以实现对未知频谱支撑的有限时间-顶点图信号的有效重建。

Abstract: Finite time-vertex graph signals (FTVGS) provide an efficient representation
for capturing spatio-temporal correlations across multiple data sources on
irregular structures. Although sampling and reconstruction of FTVGS with known
spectral support have been extensively studied, the case of unknown spectral
support requires further investigation. Existing random sampling methods may
extract samples from any vertex at any time, but such strategies are not
friendly in practice, where sampling is typically limited to a subset of
vertices and moments. To address this requirement, we propose a subset random
sampling scheme for FTVGS. Specifically, we first randomly select a subset of
rows and columns to form a submatrix, followed by random sampling within that
submatrix. In theory, we provide sufficient conditions for reconstructing the
original FTVGS with high probability. Additionally, we introduce a
reconstruction framework incorporating low-rank, sparsity, and smoothness
priors (LSSP), and verify the feasibility of the reconstruction and the
effectiveness of the framework through experiments.

Conclusion: PCFM模型具有很好的准确性和广泛的适用性，并提供了开源软件实现，可重配置以适应任何系统结构

Abstract: Ultrafast and accurate physical layer models are essential for designing,
optimizing and managing ultra-wideband optical transmission systems. We present
a closed-form GN/EGN model, named Polynomial Closed-Form Model (PCFM),
improving reliability, accuracy, and generality. The key to deriving PCFM is
expressing the spatial power profile of each channel along a span as a
polynomial. Then, under reasonable approximations, the integral calculation can
be carried out analytically, for any chosen degree of the polynomial. We
present a full detailed derivation of the model. We then validate it vs. the
numerically integrated GN-model in a challenging multiband (C+L+S) scenario,
including Raman amplification and inter-channel Raman scattering. We then show
that the approach works well also in the special case of the presence of
multiple lumped loss along the fiber. Overall, the approach shows very good
accuracy and broad applicability. A software implementing the model, fully
reconfigurable to any type of system layout, is available for download under

Result: 仿真显示传播路径数比平均SNR对平均检测概率的影响更显著，这与之前针对设备到设备网络的研究结论相反

Conclusion: 6G mMTC网络设计应重点考虑增强发射机-接收机布局和天线对准策略，而非单纯提高设备间平均SNR

Abstract: This paper investigates the characteristics of energy detection (ED) over
composite $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading channels in ultra machine-type
communication (mMTC) networks. We have derived the closed-form expressions of
the probability density function (PDF) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on
the Inverse Gaussian (\emph{IG}) distribution. By adopting novel integration
and mathematical transformation techniques, we derive a truncation-based
closed-form expression for the average detection probability for the first
time. It can be observed from our simulations that the number of propagation
paths has a more pronounced effect on average detection probability compared to
average SNR, which is in contrast to earlier studies that focus on
device-to-device networks. It suggests that for 6G mMTC network design, we
should consider enhancing transmitter-receiver placement and antenna alignment
strategies, rather than relying solely on increasing the device-to-device
average SNR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内无线能量传输中能量需求集中的"热点"区域的最小接收功率最大化问题，提高能量传输效率和覆盖性。

Conclusion: 该研究为室内近场无线能量传输系统提供了有效的部署策略，多边形部署在大多数情况下表现最优，而线形部署适用于高渗透收盛场景，为不同应用需求提供了灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the deployment of radio stripe systems for indoor
radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) in line-of-sight near-field
scenarios. The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in
specific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user
density or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and
radio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received
power across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem
into two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on
their spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii)
antenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio
stripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex
approximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are
shape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either
straight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical
results show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with
Chebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The
optimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide
range of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped
deployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile,
the line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain
settings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular
coverage.

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

Abstract: Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are systems that
detect and interpret brain activity patterns linked to the mental visualization
of movement, and then translate these into instructions for controlling
external robotic or domotic devices. Such devices have the potential to be
useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that
would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of
(Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In
the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has
been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use
of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire
framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as
well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We
trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has
been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the
state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset. The results show that our
proposed framework could be used with MI-BCI systems in light of its failsafe
classification performances, i.e. 99.5% in accuracy
