Result: 构建了一个全面的生活日志数据集，部分数据已公开，可用于机器学习模型预测睡眠质量和压力。

Conclusion: ETRI Lifelog Dataset 2024为研究人类日常生活和生活方式提供了有价值的资源，并展示了潜在的应用前景。

Abstract: Improving human health and well-being requires an accurate and effective
understanding of an individual's physical and mental state throughout daily
life. To support this goal, we utilized smartphones, smartwatches, and sleep
sensors to collect data passively and continuously for 24 hours a day, with
minimal interference to participants' usual behavior, enabling us to gather
quantitative data on daily behaviors and sleep activities across multiple days.
Additionally, we gathered subjective self-reports of participants' fatigue,
stress, and sleep quality through surveys conducted immediately before and
after sleep. This comprehensive lifelog dataset is expected to provide a
foundational resource for exploring meaningful insights into human daily life
and lifestyle patterns, and a portion of the data has been anonymized and made
publicly available for further research. In this paper, we introduce the ETRI
Lifelog Dataset 2024, detailing its structure and presenting potential
applications, such as using machine learning models to predict sleep quality
and stress.

### [2] [Detection of Autonomic Dysreflexia in Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury Using Multimodal Wearable Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03715)
*Bertram Fuchs,Mehdi Ejtehadi,Ana Cisnal,Jürgen Pannek,Anke Scheel-Sailer,Robert Riener,Inge Eriks-Hoogland,Diego Paez-Granados*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于多模态可穿戴传感器的非侵入性机器学习框架，用于检测脊髓损伤患者的自主神经反射异常（AD），通过特征选择和集成学习显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主神经反射异常（AD）是脊髓损伤患者中的一种潜在致命症状，现有监测方法多为侵入性或依赖主观报告，亟需非侵入性、客观的解决方案。

Method: 使用多模态传感器（ECG、PPG、BioZ等）采集数据，通过BorutaSHAP进行特征选择，并采用集成学习方法训练模型。

Result: HR和ECG特征最具信息量，集成模型性能最佳（Macro F1=0.77），HR模态的AUC最高（0.93）。

Conclusion: 该框架为脊髓损伤患者的实时、个性化AD监测提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition
characterized by sudden, severe blood pressure (BP) spikes in individuals with
spinal cord injury (SCI). Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent
cardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either
invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in
daily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning
framework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were
collected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies,
including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance
(BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three
commercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized
cuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature
extraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values
for explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and
aggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was
stratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived
features were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing
rhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the
highest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming
baseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve
(AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature
features contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and
low specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well
with clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward
personalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.

### [3] [Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03906)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Zak-OTFS调制在高延迟/多普勒扩展场景中优于CP-OFDM，提出了一种低复杂度的Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM架构，兼容现有网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Zak-OTFS调制在现有CP-OFDM调制解调器中的实现难题，以利用其性能优势。

Method: 通过sinc滤波和矩形时间窗口约束，将Zak-OTFS调制解调器实现为CP-OFDM的低复杂度前后处理模块。

Result: 提出了一种兼容现有基础设施的Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM架构，并证明CP-OFDM是其特例。

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM架构为下一代通信系统提供了高效且兼容的调制方案。

Abstract: Zak-Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to
achieve significantly better performance compared to the standardized
Cyclic-Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM), in high
delay/Doppler spread scenarios envisaged in next generation communication
systems. Zak-OTFS carriers are quasi-periodic pulses in the delay-Doppler (DD)
domain, characterized by two parameters, (i) the pulse period along the delay
axis (``delay period") (Doppler period is related to the delay period), and
(ii) the pulse shaping filter. An important practical challenge is enabling
support for Zak-OTFS modulation in existing CP-OFDM based modems. In this paper
we show that Zak-OTFS modulation with pulse shaping constrained to sinc
filtering (filter bandwidth equal to the communication bandwidth $B$) followed
by time-windowing with a rectangular window of duration $(T + T_{cp})$ ($T$ is
the symbol duration and $T_{cp}$ is the CP duration), can be implemented as a
low-complexity precoder over standard CP-OFDM. We also show that the Zak-OTFS
de-modulator with matched filtering constrained to sinc filtering (filter
bandwidth $B$) followed by rectangular time windowing over duration $T$ can be
implemented as a low-complexity post-processing of the CP-OFDM de-modulator
output. This proposed ``Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM" architecture enables us to
harness the benefits of Zak-OTFS in existing network infrastructure. We also
show that the proposed Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM is a family of modulations, with
CP-OFDM being a special case when the delay period takes its minimum possible
value equal to the inverse bandwidth, i.e., Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM with minimum
delay period.

### [4] [Optimal Interference Exploitation Waveform Design with Relaxed Block-Level Power Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04046)
*Xiao Tong,Lei Lei,Ang Li,A. Lee Swindlehurst,Symeon Chatzinotas*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非线性波形优化框架，用于多用户MIMO系统中的PSK和QAM符号设计，解决了现有线性CI预编码方法的性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于线性CI的预编码方法（如SLP和BLP）因严格的符号级功率预算或自由度不足而性能受限。

Method: 提出非线性波形优化框架，引入额外优化变量，最大化传输块中的最小CI度量，并通过QP问题和改进的ADMM算法求解。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提算法在高阶调制和大块长度下显著优于传统CI-SLP和CI-BLP方法。

Conclusion: 非线性波形优化框架有效提升了多用户MIMO系统中的性能，尤其在复杂调制和大块传输场景下。

Abstract: This paper investigates constructive interference (CI)-based waveform design
for phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation symbols under
relaxed block-level power constraints in multi-user multiple-input
single-output (MU-MIMO) communication systems. Existing linear CI-based
precoding methods, including symbol-level precoding (SLP) and block-level
precoding (BLP), suffer from performance limitations due to strict symbol-level
power budgets or insufficient degrees of freedom over the block. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a nonlinear waveform optimization framework that
introduces additional optimization variables and maximizes the minimum CI
metric across the transmission block. The optimal waveform is derived in closed
form using the function and Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions, and the solution is
explicitly expressed with respect to the dual variables. Moreover, the original
problems are equivalently reformulated as tractable quadratic programming (QP)
problems. To efficiently solve the derived QP problems, we develop an improved
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm by integrating a
linear-time projection technique, which significantly enhances the
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithms substantially outperform the conventional CI-SLP and CI-BLP
approaches, particularly under high-order modulations and large block lengths.

### [5] [WiFo-CF: Wireless Foundation Model for CSI Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04068)
*Liu Xuanyu,Gao Shijian,Liu Boxun,Cheng Xiang,Yang Liuqing*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: WiFo-CF是一种新型无线基础模型，通过多用户多速率自监督预训练和S-R MoE架构，解决了传统CSI反馈模型在异构配置下的局限性，并展示了优异的性能和部署潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的CSI反馈方案在固定系统配置下表现良好，但缺乏对异构配置的适应性和灵活性。

Method: 提出WiFo-CF模型，采用多用户多速率自监督预训练策略和S-R MoE架构，支持异构配置的统一处理。

Result: 模型在模拟和真实场景中均表现出色，且学习到的表征能有效支持下游任务（如CSI室内定位）。

Conclusion: WiFo-CF具有优异的泛化能力和部署潜力，为CSI反馈提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based channel state information (CSI) feedback schemes
demonstrate strong compression capabilities but are typically constrained to
fixed system configurations, limiting their generalization and flexibility. To
address this challenge, WiFo-CF, a novel wireless foundation model tailored for
CSI feedback, is proposed, uniquely accommodating heterogeneous configurations
such as varying channel dimensions, feedback rates, and data distributions
within a unified framework through its key innovations: (1) a multi-user,
multi-rate self-supervised pre-training strategy; and (2) a Mixture of Shared
and Routed Expert (S-R MoE) architecture. Supporting the large-scale
pre-training of WiFo-CF is the first heterogeneous channel feedback dataset,
whose diverse patterns enable the model to achieve superior performance on both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data across simulated and real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, the learned representations effectively facilitate
adaptation to downstream tasks such as CSI-based indoor localization,
validating WiFo-CF's scalability and deployment potential.

### [6] [DFT-s-OFDM with Chirp Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04075)
*Yujie Liu,Yong Liang Guan,David González G.,Halim Yanikomeroglu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型波形DFT-s-OFDM-CM，结合了啁啾调制，提高了频谱效率并保持了低PAPR和频率多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为下一代无线通信设计一种既能保持低PAPR和频率多样性，又能提高频谱效率的波形。

Method: 通过将信息比特分配到Q进制星座符号和啁啾信号的起始频率上，结合DFT-s-OFDM和啁啾调制。

Result: 仿真结果表明，DFT-s-OFDM-CM在保持类似BER的同时提高了频谱效率，且在相同频谱效率下，通过分流信息比特，使用低阶调制，降低了BER。

Conclusion: DFT-s-OFDM-CM是一种高效的波形设计，适用于下一代无线通信系统。

Abstract: In this paper, a new waveform called discrete Fourier transform spread
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with chirp modulation
(DFT-s-OFDM-CM) is proposed for the next generation of wireless communications.
The information bits are conveyed by not only Q-ary constellation symbols but
also the starting frequency of chirp signal. It could maintain the benefits
provided by the chirped discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM), e.g., low peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR), full frequency diversity exploitation, etc. Simulation results confirm
that the proposed DFT-s-OFDM-CM could achieve higher spectral efficiency while
keeping the similar bit error rate (BER) to that of chirped DFT-s-OFDM. In
addition, when maintaining the same spectral efficiency, the proposed
DFT-s-OFDM-CM with the splitting of information bits into two streams enables
the use of lower-order constellation modulation and offers greater resilience
to noise, resulting in a lower BER than the chirped DFT-s-OFDM.

### [7] [Neuro-MoBRE: Exploring Multi-subject Multi-task Intracranial Decoding via Explicit Heterogeneity Resolving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04128)
*Di Wu,Yifei Jia,Siyuan Li,Shiqi Zhao,Jie Yang,Mohamad Sawan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Neuro-MoBRE是一个通用的神经生理解码框架，通过区域专家混合和嵌入机制解决数据异质性，在多任务和跨被试场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经生理解码方法局限于单任务和单个被试，数据异质性限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 结合脑区-时间嵌入机制和专家混合方法，采用区域掩码自编码预训练和任务解耦信息聚合。

Result: 在11名被试的五项任务中表现优于现有方法，并展示零样本解码能力。

Conclusion: Neuro-MoBRE有效解决了神经生理数据异质性，提升了跨任务和跨被试的泛化性能。

Abstract: Neurophysiological decoding, fundamental to advancing brain-computer
interface (BCI) technologies, has significantly benefited from recent advances
in deep learning. However, existing decoding approaches largely remain
constrained to single-task scenarios and individual subjects, limiting their
broader applicability and generalizability. Efforts towards creating
large-scale neurophysiological foundation models have shown promise, but
continue to struggle with significant challenges due to pervasive data
heterogeneity across subjects and decoding tasks. Simply increasing model
parameters and dataset size without explicitly addressing this heterogeneity
fails to replicate the scaling successes seen in natural language processing.
Here, we introduce the Neural Mixture of Brain Regional Experts (Neuro-MoBRE),
a general-purpose decoding framework explicitly designed to manage the
ubiquitous data heterogeneity in neurophysiological modeling. Neuro-MoBRE
incorporates a brain-regional-temporal embedding mechanism combined with a
mixture-of-experts approach, assigning neural signals from distinct brain
regions to specialized regional experts on a unified embedding basis, thus
explicitly resolving both structural and functional heterogeneity.
Additionally, our region-masked autoencoding pre-training strategy further
enhances representational consistency among subjects, complemented by a
task-disentangled information aggregation method tailored to effectively handle
task-specific neural variations. Evaluations conducted on intracranial
recordings from 11 subjects across five diverse tasks, including complex
language decoding and epileptic seizure diagnosis, demonstrate that Neuro-MoBRE
surpasses prior art and exhibits robust generalization for zero-shot decoding
on unseen subjects.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于双功能雷达通信系统的波束成形方法，优化雷达和通信性能，解决频谱拥塞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频谱拥塞问题日益严重，集成通信与感知设计可能提供解决方案。

Result: 数值实验验证了所提设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在频谱共享和性能优化方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The integrated design of communication and sensing may offer a potential
solution to address spectrum congestion. In this work, we develop a beamforming
method for a dual-function radar-communication system, where the transmit
signal is used for both radar surveillance and communication with multiple
downlink users, despite imperfect channel state information (CSI). We focus on
two scenarios of interest: radar-centric and communication-centric. In the
radar-centric scenario, the primary goal is to optimize radar performance while
attaining acceptable communication performance. To this end, we minimize a
weighted sum of the mean-squared error in achieving a desired beampattern and a
mean-squared cross correlation of the radar returns from directions of interest
(DOI). We also seek to ensure that the probability of outage for the
communication users remains below a desired threshold. In the
communication-centric scenario, our main objective is to minimize the maximum
probability of outage among the communication users while keeping the
aforementioned radar metrics below a desired threshold. Both optimization
problems are stochastic and untractable. We first take advantage of central
limit theorem to obtain deterministic non-convex problems and then consider
relaxations of these problems in the form of semidefinite programs with rank-1
constraints. We provide numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness
of the proposed designs.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了两种宽频近场定位的子空间拟合方法，解决了传统远场系统中距离和角度耦合的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统远场系统中距离和角度可以分开估计，但在近场系统中由于球面波传播导致参数耦合，需要新的方法。

Method: 推导了多目标宽频近场系统的频域信号模型，并提出了基于子空间拟合的MUSIC方法联合估计距离和角度；进一步引入Fresnel近似MUSIC算法降低复杂度。

Result: 数值结果验证了两种方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了近场系统中距离和角度的联合估计问题，且Fresnel近似算法显著降低了复杂度。

Abstract: Two subspace fitting approaches are proposed for wideband near-field
localization. Unlike in conventional far-field systems, where distance and
angle can be estimated separately, spherical wave propagation in near-field
systems couples these parameters. We therefore derive a frequency-domain
near-field signal model for multi-target wideband systems and develop a
subspace fitting-based MUSIC method that jointly estimates distance and angle.
To reduce complexity, a Fresnel approximation MUSIC algorithm is further
introduced to decouple the distance and angle parameters. Numerical results
verify the effectiveness of both proposed approaches.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种同时信息和控制信号（SICS）协议，以解决RIS在无线接入网络中因信号延迟导致的过时控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RIS与边缘单元的信号传输中，信号延迟可能超过信道相干时间，导致控制信号过时，影响性能。

Method: 采用SICS协议，通过无线控制信号传输实现操作适应。RIS工作在STAR模式，源端使用NOMA叠加信息和控制信号。

Result: 通过优化问题求解RIS的反射和传输系数以及NOMA的叠加系数，SICS方法表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SICS协议有效解决了信号延迟问题，提升了用户数据速率和控制信号的解码能力。

Abstract: Integration of RIS in radio access networks requires signaling between edge
units and the RIS microcontroller (MC). Unfortunately, in several practical
scenarios, the signaling latency is higher than the communication channel
coherence time, which causes outdated signaling at the RIS. To counterbalance
this, we introduce a simultaneous information and control signaling (SICS)
protocol that enables operation adaptation through wireless control signal
transmission. SICS assumes that the MC is equipped with a single antenna that
operates at the same frequency as the RIS. RIS operates in simultaneous
transmission and reflection (STAR) mode, and the source employs non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) to superposition the information signal to the control
signal. To maximize the achievable user data rate while ensuring the MC's
ability to decode the control signal, we formulate and solve the corresponding
optimization problem that returns RIS's reflection and transmission
coefficients as well as the superposition coefficients of the NOMA scheme. Our
results reveal the robustness of the SICS approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动用户设备（UE）在毫米波宽带MIMO系统中处理大量基带样本的计算和硬件复杂度问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法性能优于混合波束成形，适用于未来系统。

Conclusion: 两阶段全数字收发器在毫米波系统中具有吸引力，能有效降低复杂度并提升性能。

Abstract: This paper considers a millimeter-wave wideband point-to-point MIMO system
with fully digital transceivers at the base station and the user equipment
(UE), focusing on mobile UE scenarios. A main challenge when building a digital
UE combining is the large volume of baseband samples to handle. To mitigate
computational and hardware complexity, we propose a novel two-stage digital
combining scheme at the UE. The first stage reduces the $N_{\text{r}}$ received
signals to $N_{\text{c}}$ streams before baseband processing, leveraging
channel geometry for dimension reduction and updating at the beam coherence
time, which is longer than the channel coherence time of the small-scale
fading. By contrast, the second-stage combining is updated per fading
realization. We develop a pilot-based channel estimation framework for this
hardware setup based on maximum likelihoodestimation in both uplink and
downlink. Digital precoding and combining designs are proposed, and a spectral
efficiency expression that incorporates imperfect channel knowledge is derived.
The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms hybrid
beamforming, showcasing the attractiveness of using two-stage fully digital
transceivers in future systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信道估计方法在ELAA系统中因近场传播和空间非平稳性而效果不佳，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于物理的混合信道模型，结合非二进制可见区域（VR）掩码，并开发了VR-HMM-P-SOMP算法，通过HMM和贪婪稀疏恢复框架实现自适应估计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在低信噪比和稀疏场景下提高了估计精度，同时保持了低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该算法在多种设计参数和信道条件下表现稳健，为ELAA系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on channel estimation in extremely large aperture array
(ELAA) systems, where near-field propagation and spatial non-stationarity
introduce complexities that hinder the effectiveness of traditional estimation
techniques. A physics-based hybrid channel model is developed, incorporating
non-binary visibility region (VR) masks to simulate diffraction-induced power
variations across the antenna array. To address the estimation challenges posed
by these channel conditions, a novel algorithm is proposed:
Visibility-Region-HMM-Aided Polar-Domain Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching
Pursuit (VR-HMM-P-SOMP). The method extends a greedy sparse recovery framework
by integrating VR estimation through a hidden Markov model (HMM), using a novel
emission formulation and Viterbi decoding. This allows the algorithm to
adaptively mask steering vectors and account for spatial non-stationarity at
the antenna level. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
enhances estimation accuracy compared to existing techniques, particularly in
low-SNR and sparse scenarios, while maintaining a low computational complexity.
The algorithm presents robustness across a range of design parameters and
channel conditions, offering a practical solution for ELAA systems.

*Anbang Zhang,Shuaishuai Guo,Chenyuan Feng,Shuai Liu,Hongyang Du,Geyong Min*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的自适应混合分布方案（WS-DC），用于提高任务导向语义通信的频谱效率和信道容量利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务导向语义通信方法中，稀疏激活的码本导致频谱效率低和信道容量未充分利用，亟需设计一种既能支持任务推理又能接近信道容量理论极限的码本。

Method: 构建了一个频谱效率感知的码本设计框架，将码本激活概率纳入优化过程，并引入Wasserstein距离作为正则化指标，最小化学习到的激活分布与最优信道输入分布之间的差距。

Result: 实验表明，WS-DC在推理准确性和码本效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WS-DC为接近信道容量的语义通信系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Digital task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) aims to transmit only
task-relevant information, significantly reducing communication overhead.
Existing ToSC methods typically rely on learned codebooks to encode semantic
features and map them to constellation symbols. However, these codebooks are
often sparsely activated, resulting in low spectral efficiency and
underutilization of channel capacity. This highlights a key challenge: how to
design a codebook that not only supports task-specific inference but also
approaches the theoretical limits of channel capacity. To address this
challenge, we construct a spectral efficiency-aware codebook design framework
that explicitly incorporates the codebook activation probability into the
optimization process. Beyond maximizing task performance, we introduce the
Wasserstein (WS) distance as a regularization metric to minimize the gap
between the learned activation distribution and the optimal channel input
distribution. Furthermore, we reinterpret WS theory from a generative
perspective to align with the semantic nature of ToSC. Combining the above two
aspects, we propose a WS-based adaptive hybrid distribution scheme, termed
WS-DC, which learns compact, task-driven and channel-aware latent
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that WS-DC not only
outperforms existing approaches in inference accuracy but also significantly
improves codebook efficiency, offering a promising direction toward
capacity-approaching semantic communication systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏非英语语言的多模态脑-语言配对数据，阻碍了神经活动与大型语言模型语义表示的对齐。

Method: 扩展了之前的ChineseEEG数据集，新增了朗读和被动听两种模态，记录了EEG和音频数据，并提供了语义嵌入和任务标签。

Result: 数据集支持跨朗读、听力和阅读的联合语义对齐学习，为神经解码算法提供了基准。

Conclusion: ChineseEEG-2为下一代神经语义解码提供了基准数据集，促进了多模态语言任务下的脑-LLM对齐。

Abstract: EEG-based neural decoding requires large-scale benchmark datasets. Paired
brain-language data across speaking, listening, and reading modalities are
essential for aligning neural activity with the semantic representation of
large language models (LLMs). However, such datasets are rare, especially for
non-English languages. Here, we present ChineseEEG-2, a high-density EEG
dataset designed for benchmarking neural decoding models under real-world
language tasks. Building on our previous ChineseEEG dataset, which focused on
silent reading, ChineseEEG-2 adds two active modalities: Reading Aloud (RA) and
Passive Listening (PL), using the same Chinese corpus. EEG and audio were
simultaneously recorded from four participants during ~10.7 hours of reading
aloud. These recordings were then played to eight other participants,
collecting ~21.6 hours of EEG during listening. This setup enables speech
temporal and semantic alignment across the RA and PL modalities. ChineseEEG-2
includes EEG signals, precise audio, aligned semantic embeddings from
pre-trained language models, and task labels. Together with ChineseEEG, this
dataset supports joint semantic alignment learning across speaking, listening,
and reading. It enables benchmarking of neural decoding algorithms and promotes
brain-LLM alignment under multimodal language tasks, especially in Chinese.
ChineseEEG-2 provides a benchmark dataset for next-generation neural semantic
decoding.

Motivation: 6G系统中高移动性场景对波形设计提出了挑战，OFDM在多普勒扩展下存在子载波正交性损失，而OTFS虽能利用时频（TF）域信道分集，但接收复杂度高且资源分配不灵活。因此，需要一种既能保留OFDM优势又能提升性能的方案。

Method: 设计了DD-a-OFDM系统结构，保留了经典OFDM收发机，同时引入DD域信道估计和TF域均衡。通过离散TF导频进行DD域信道估计，将TF域载波间干扰（ICI）转化为DD域高斯干扰，并推导了CRLB。开发了ML和峰值检测的信道估计器及对应的TF域均衡器。

Result: 数值结果表明，DD-a-OFDM相比经典OFDM降低了误码率（BER），且在信道估计精度上优于OTFS，同时导频开销更低。

Conclusion: DD-a-OFDM是一种在高移动性场景下提升OFDM性能的有效方案，兼具低复杂度和灵活性，适用于6G系统。

Abstract: High-mobility scenarios will be a critical part of 6G systems. Since the
widely deployed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform
suffers from subcarrier orthogonality loss under severe Doppler spread,
delay-Doppler domain multi-carrier (DDMC) modulation systems, such as
orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), have been extensively studied. While
OTFS can exploit time-frequency (TF) domain channel diversity, it faces
challenges including high receiver complexity and inflexible TF resource
allocation, making OFDM still the most promising waveform for 6G. In this
article, we propose a DD domain signal processing-aided OFDM (DD-a-OFDM) scheme
to enhance OFDM performance based on DDMC research insights. First, we design a
DD-a-OFDM system structure, retaining the classical OFDM transceiver while
incorporating DD domain channel estimation and TF domain equalization. Second,
we detail DD domain channel estimation using discrete TF pilots and prove that
TF domain inter-carrier interference (ICI) could be transformed into DD domain
Gaussian interference. Third, we derive closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds
(CRLBs) for DD domain channel estimation. Fourth, we develop maximum likelihood
(ML) and peak detection-based channel estimators, along with a corresponding TF
domain equalizer. Numerical results verify the proposed design, showing that
DD-a-OFDM reduces the bit-error rate (BER) compared to classical OFDM and
outperforms OTFS in channel estimation accuracy with lower pilot overhead.

Abstract: Discrete representation has emerged as a powerful tool in task-oriented
semantic communication (ToSC), offering compact, interpretable, and efficient
representations well-suited for low-power edge intelligence scenarios. Its
inherent digital nature aligns seamlessly with hardware-friendly deployment and
robust storage/transmission protocols. However, despite its strengths, current
ToSC frameworks often decouple semantic-aware discrete mapping from the
underlying channel characteristics and task demands. This mismatch leads to
suboptimal communication performance, degraded task utility, and limited
generalization under variable wireless conditions. Moreover, conventional
designs frequently overlook channel-awareness in codebook construction,
restricting the effectiveness of semantic symbol selection under constrained
resources. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a channel-aware
discrete semantic coding framework tailored for low-power edge networks.
Leveraging a Wasserstein-regularized objective, our approach aligns discrete
code activations with optimal input distributions, thereby improving semantic
fidelity, robustness, and task accuracy. Extensive experiments on the inference
tasks across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes show that our method
achieves notable gains in accuracy and communication efficiency. This work
provides new insights into integrating discrete semantics and channel
optimization, paving the way for the widespread adoption of semantic
communication in future digital infrastructures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流体天线中继（FAR）的节能无线通信系统，解决由遮挡引起的非视距（NLoS）链路问题，并通过优化天线位置和协议设计提高能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G通信需求推动了流体天线系统（FAS）的发展，但现有研究主要关注视距（LoS）场景，忽视了非视距（NLoS）链路的问题。

Method: 设计了结合放大转发（AF）协议的FAR辅助通信系统，优化流体天线位置、功率控制和波束成形，提出迭代算法解决能效最大化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提算法在能效上优于传统方案，比传统可重构智能表面（RIS）和AF中继方案分别高出23.39%和39.94%。

Conclusion: FAR系统通过优化天线位置和协议设计，显著提高了非视距通信的能效，为6G通信提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an energy efficient wireless communication system
based on fluid antenna relay (FAR) to solve the problem of non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) links caused by blockages with considering the physical properties.
Driven by the demand for the sixth generation (6G) communication, fluid antenna
systems (FASs) have become a key technology due to their flexibility in
dynamically adjusting antenna positions. Existing research on FAS primarily
focuses on line-of-sight (LoS) communication scenarios, and neglects the
situations where only NLoS links exist. To address the issues posted by NLoS
communication, we design an FAR-assisted communication system combined with
amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. In order to alleviate the high energy
consumption introduced by AF protocol while ensuring communication quality, we
formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. By optimizing the
positions of the fluid antennas (FAs) on both sides of the FAR, we achieve
controllable phase shifts of the signals transmitting through the blockage
which causes the NLoS link. Besides, we establish a channel model that jointly
considers the blockage-through matrix, large-scale fading, and small-scale
fading. To maximize the EE of the system, we jointly optimize the FAR position,
FA positions, power control, and beamforming design under given constraints,
and propose an iterative algorithm to solve this formulated optimization
problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
traditional schemes in terms of EE, achieving up to $23.39\%$ and $39.94\%$
higher EE than the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) scheme
and traditional AF relay scheme, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于液晶技术的可重构智能表面（RIS）设计，用于宽带OFDM系统，以提高安全通信中的保密率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 液晶RIS的相位偏移响应具有频率依赖性，可能导致性能下降和信息泄露，尤其在安全通信系统中。

Method: 设计了一种RIS算法，避免全信道状态信息获取和频繁重新配置，同时确保信号覆盖合法用户区域并避免泄露给潜在窃听者。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在8 GHz带宽和60 GHz中心频率下，保密率约为2比特/符号，优于忽略频率依赖性的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了液晶RIS的频率依赖性问题，显著提高了安全通信的保密率。

Abstract: Liquid crystal (LC) technology provides a low-power and scalable approach to
implement a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). However, the LC-based
RIS's phase-shift response is inherently frequency-dependent, which can lead to
performance degradation if not properly addressed. This issue becomes
especially critical in secure communication systems, where such variations may
result in considerable information leakage. To avoid the need for full channel
state information (CSI) acquisition and frequent RIS reconfiguration, we design
RIS for a wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system to
illuminate a desired area containing legitimate users while avoiding leakage to
regions where potential eavesdroppers may be located. Our simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the secrecy rate compared to
methods that neglect frequency-dependent effects. In the considered setup, the
proposed method achieves a secrecy rate of about 2 bits/symbol over an 8 GHz
bandwidth when the center frequency is 60 GHz.

Result: 在低阶PAM下实现亚厘米级定位精度和低误码率，性能在LED布局中心显著提升。

Conclusion: 系统在6G室内网络中具有潜力，能有效集成定位与通信功能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint communication and indoor positioning (JCP) system
based on visible light communication (VLC) designed for high-precision indoor
environments. The framework supports 2D and 3D positioning using received
signal strength (RSS) from pilot transmissions, enhanced by the radical axis
theorem to improve accuracy under measurement uncertainties. Communication is
achieved using spatial modulation (SM) with M-ary pulse amplitude modulation
(PAM), where data is conveyed through the modulation symbol and the active
light-emitting diode (LED) index, improving spectral efficiency while
maintaining low complexity. A pilot-aided least squares (LS) estimator is
employed for joint channel and dimming coefficient estimation, enabling robust
symbol detection in multipath environments characterized by both line-of-sight
(LOS) and diffuse non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components, modeled using Rician
fading. The proposed system incorporates a dimming control mechanism to meet
lighting requirements while maintaining reliable communication and positioning
performance. Simulation results demonstrate sub-centimeter localization
accuracy at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and bit error rates (BERs) below
10^{-6} for low-order PAM schemes. Additionally, comparative analysis across
user locations reveals that positioning and communication performance improve
significantly near the geometric center of the LED layout. These findings
validate the effectiveness of the proposed system for future 6G indoor networks
requiring integrated localization and communication under practical channel
conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D打印中非法物品的追踪问题，通过嵌入唯一标识符，增强法医调查能力。

Method: 利用纠错码原理，提出针对一维、二维和三维数据的编码方案，并引入DNA存储技术中的纠错方法。

Result: 实现了从单一足够大的片段中解码多维信息，并支持纠错功能。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D打印物体的追踪和法医调查提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) printing's accessibility enables rapid manufacturing
but also poses security risks, such as the unauthorized production of
untraceable firearms and prohibited items. To ensure traceability and
accountability, embedding unique identifiers within printed objects is
essential, in order to assist forensic investigation of illicit use. This paper
models data embedding in 3D printing using principles from error-correcting
codes, aiming to recover embedded information from partial or altered fragments
of the object. Previous works embedded one-dimensional data (i.e., a vector)
inside the object, and required almost all fragments of the object for
successful decoding. In this work, we study a problem setting in which only one
sufficiently large fragment of the object is available for decoding. We first
show that for one-dimensional embedded information the problem can be easily
solved using existing tools. Then, we introduce novel encoding schemes for
two-dimensional information (i.e., a matrix), and three-dimensional information
(i.e., a cube) which enable the information to be decoded from any sufficiently
large rectangle-shaped or cuboid-shaped fragment. Lastly, we introduce a code
that is also capable of correcting bit-flip errors, using techniques from
recently proposed codes for DNA storage. Our codes operate at non-vanishing
rates, and involve concepts from discrepancy theory called Van der Corput sets
and Halton-Hammersely sets in novel ways.

Motivation: 单重码在Hamming和秩度量下的分类已较为清晰，但在和秩度量下更为复杂，本文旨在探索其几何性质并填补分类空白。

Method: 分别研究恒定秩列表码、恒定秩轮廓码和MSRD单重码，通过扩展秩度量结果、构造示例和连接有限几何问题（如分散线性集和阻塞集）进行分析。

Conclusion: 和秩度量下的单重码展现出丰富的几何结构，未来研究可进一步探索恒定秩轮廓码的完整分类及更高维度的MSRD单重码。

Abstract: One-weight codes, in which all nonzero codewords share the same weight, form
a highly structured class of linear codes with deep connections to finite
geometry. While their classification is well understood in the Hamming and rank
metrics - being equivalent to (direct sums of) simplex codes - the sum-rank
metric presents a far more intricate landscape. In this work, we explore the
geometry of one-weight sum-rank metric codes, focusing on three distinct
classes. First, we introduce and classify \emph{constant rank-list} sum-rank
codes, where each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks, extending
results from the rank-metric setting. Next, we investigate the more general
\emph{constant rank-profile} codes, where, up to reordering, each nonzero
codeword has the same tuple of ranks. Although a complete classification
remains elusive, we present the first examples and partial structural results
for this class. Finally, we consider one-weight codes that are also MSRD
(Maximum Sum-Rank Distance) codes. For dimension two, constructions arise from
partitions of scattered linear sets on projective lines. For dimension three,
we connect their existence to that of special $2$-fold blocking sets in the
projective plane, leading to new bounds and nonexistence results over certain
fields.

Motivation: 探讨VP预编码与LR结合在互信息指标下的表现，揭示THP的优越性。

Method: 分析互信息表达式中的速率分配矩阵，推导其最优选择，并比较不同算法的性能。

Result: 优化速率分配矩阵后，LR辅助算法无法超越THP速率，THP表现更优。

Conclusion: THP在互信息指标下更有效，LR辅助算法无优势，速率分配矩阵对性能至关重要。

Abstract: Vector perturbation (VP) precoding is an effective nonlinear precoding
technique in the downlink (DL) with modulo channels. Especially, when combined
with Lattice reduction (LR), low-complexity algorithms achieve very promising
performances, outperforming other popular nonlinear precoding techniques like
Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). However, these results are based on the
uncoded symbol error rate (SER) or uncoded bit error rate (BER). We show that
when using the mutual information as the figure of merit, the observation is
fundamentally different and that these algorithms generally do not outperform
THP. Within the expression of the mutual information, a rate allocation matrix
can be incorporated, which has not received much attention so far. In this
article, we derive the optimal choice of this matrix for different algorithms,
and we show that this matrix is indeed crucial for the performance, especially
for ill-conditioned channels. Furthermore, when using an optimized choice of
this matrix, we show that the classical LR-aided algorithms cannot exceed the
rate of THP, highlighting the effectiveness of the THP method. This concept can
be generalized to a whole class of algorithms for which LR yields no
improvement. We derive the corresponding properties and categorize various
algorithms accordingly.

explicit description of Riemann--Roch space bases for arbitrary divisors is
particularly valuable as it simultaneously enables efficient code construction
and reveals structural properties of the codes leading to the new cryptanalysis
methods when these codes are employed in cryptographic schemes

Motivation: 大规模分布式训练中，静默数据损坏（SDC）可能导致矩阵乘法错误，进而影响模型收敛和预测准确性。这些错误难以检测且会累积，因此需要一种有效的校正方法。

Conclusion: 提出的编码框架在理论和实验上均验证了其正确性和鲁棒性，显著提升了矩阵乘法在分布式训练中的容错能力。

Abstract: Matrix multiplication over the real field constitutes a foundational
operation in the training of deep learning models, serving as a computational
cornerstone for both forward and backward propagation processes. However, the
presence of silent data corruption (SDC) in large-scale distributed training
environments poses a significant threat to model convergence and predictive
accuracy, particularly when such errors manifest during matrix multiplication.
Due to their transient and non-intrusive nature, these errors often evade
detection, allowing them to propagate and accumulate over time, ultimately
leading to substantial degradation in model performance. In this paper, we
introduce a novel error-correcting coding framework specifically tailored for
matrix multiplication operations. Our proposed framework is designed to detect
and correct multiple computational errors that may arise during the execution
of matrix products. By leveraging a grid-based structural encoding scheme, our
approach enhances error localization and correction capabilities across all
participating matrices, thereby significantly improving the fault tolerance of
the computation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
deterministic correction of up to two erroneous symbols distributed across
three matrices with 100\% reliability, while incurring only a 24\% overhead in
computational time on GPU architectures. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis of the error-correction properties inherent to our coding
scheme, establishing its correctness and robustness under well-defined fault
models.

Abstract: In the domain of molecular communication (MC), information is conveyed
through the characteristics of molecules transmitted between the transmitter
and the receiver bionanosensors via propagation. The constrained size of the
transmitter imposes limitations on its storage capacity, constraining the
number of available molecules for transmission, with a resulting effect on
communication reliability. This paper primarily focuses on achieving an
equilibrium between the number of transmitted molecules and the bit error rate
(BER) performance. To this end, we first analyze the relationship between the
number of transmitted molecules and the BER performance. Subsequently, a
balancing function that considers both the number of transmitted molecules and
the BER performance is introduced, taking into account the molecules'
respective weights. Given the difference in magnitude between the number of
transmitted molecules and the BER, these parameters are normalized to
facilitate analysis. Subsequently, a Gradient Descent Algorithm is employed to
determine the optimal number of transmitted molecules, aiming to achieve the
optimal equilibrium in the analyzed MC system. Theoretical and simulation
results are provided, substantiating that the optimal outcome indeed
establishes an ideal balance between the number of transmitted molecules and
the BER.

Motivation: 6G无线网络中的ISAC技术面临近场效应和高硬件成本问题，需要设计硬件和能源高效的解决方案。

Method: 推导了点目标和扩展目标的CRB/BCRB，并通过优化波束聚焦设计最小化这些界限，同时确保系统能效和通信质量。采用了惩罚性连续凸逼近和交替优化算法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ISAC系统中能效与目标估计精度之间的权衡，为未来6G网络设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a pivotal component of
sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, leveraging high-frequency bands and
massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) to deliver both high-capacity
communication and high-precision sensing. However, these technological
advancements lead to significant near-field effects, while the implementation
of M-MIMO \mbox{is associated with considerable} hardware costs and escalated
power consumption. In this context, hybrid architecture designs emerge as both
hardware-efficient and energy-efficient solutions. Motivated by these
considerations, we investigate the design of energy-efficient hybrid
beamfocusing for near-field ISAC under two distinct target scenarios, i.e., a
point target and an extended target. Specifically, we first derive the
closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) of joint angle-and-distance estimation
for the point target and the Bayesian CRB (BCRB) of the target response matrix
for the extended target. Building on these derived results, we minimize the
CRB/BCRB by optimizing the transmit beamfocusing, while ensuring the energy
efficiency (EE) of the system and the quality-of-service (QoS) for
communication users. To address the resulting \mbox{nonconvex problems}, we
first utilize a penalty-based successive convex approximation technique with a
fully-digital beamformer to obtain a suboptimal solution. Then, we propose an
efficient alternating \mbox{optimization} algorithm to design the
analog-and-digital beamformer. \mbox{Simulation} results indicate that joint
distance-and-angle estimation is feasible in the near-field region. However,
the adopted hybrid architectures inevitably degrade the accuracy of distance
estimation, compared with their fully-digital counterparts. Furthermore,
enhancements in system EE would compromise the accuracy of target estimation,
unveiling a nontrivial tradeoff.
