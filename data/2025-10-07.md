Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文评估了空地一体化ISAC网络在恒虚警率下的雷达探测覆盖概率，分析了聚合感知干扰分布，相比最强干扰近似方法更适合高密度基站场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支持低空经济发展，需要构建可靠稳健的空地一体化ISAC网络，提供通信和感知服务。

Method: 通过分析聚合感知干扰分布来评估网络感知能力，采用恒虚警率下的雷达探测覆盖概率作为评估指标。

Result: 仿真验证了分析方法的有效性，表明考虑聚合干扰比最强干扰近似更适合高密度基站场景。

Conclusion: 在皮蜂窝高密度基站场景中，考虑聚合感知干扰的分析方法比传统最强干扰近似更准确，为低空经济ISAC网络设计提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: To support the development of low altitude economy, the air-ground integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) networks need to be constructed to provide
reliable and robust communication and sensing services. In this paper, the
sensing capabilities in the cooperative air-ground ISAC networks are evaluated
in terms of area radar detection coverage probability under a constant false
alarm rate, where the distribution of aggregated sensing interferences is
analyzed as a key intermediate result. Compared with the analysis based on the
strongest interferer approximation, taking the aggregated sensing interference
into consideration is better suited for pico-cell scenarios with high base
station density. Simulations are conducted to validate the analysis.

### [2] [Privacy Enhancement in Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Adaptive Receive Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03860)
*Faeze Moradi Kalarde,Ben Liang,Min Dong,Yahia A. Eldemerdash Ahmed,Ho Ting Cheng*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在联邦学习空中聚合中自适应设计接收缩放因子的方法，以平衡训练收敛性和隐私保护之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习的空中聚合中，接收缩放因子的大小会影响训练性能和设备隐私。较大的缩放因子可以减少有效噪声功率并提高训练性能，但会通过减少不确定性来损害设备的隐私。

Method: 提出了一个名为AdaScale的在线算法，基于一系列新颖的每轮问题，可以高效解决。该算法通过动态调整接收缩放因子来最小化整体Rényi差分隐私泄漏，同时确保全局损失函数的收敛。

Result: 数值实验表明，与现有基准方法相比，该方法在不影响学习性能的情况下有效减少了RDP和DP泄漏。

Conclusion: AdaScale算法能够在动态信道条件下平衡联邦学习中的训练收敛性和隐私保护，实现了时间平均RDP泄漏的递减动态遗憾，同时确保FL训练收敛到平稳点。

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL) with over-the-air aggregation, the quality of the
signal received at the server critically depends on the receive scaling
factors. While a larger scaling factor can reduce the effective noise power and
improve training performance, it also compromises the privacy of devices by
reducing uncertainty. In this work, we aim to adaptively design the receive
scaling factors across training rounds to balance the trade-off between
training convergence and privacy in an FL system under dynamic channel
conditions. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the
overall R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) leakage over the entire training
process, subject to a long-term constraint that ensures convergence of the
global loss function. Our problem depends on unknown future information, and we
observe that standard Lyapunov optimization is not applicable. Thus, we develop
a new online algorithm, termed AdaScale, based on a sequence of novel per-round
problems that can be solved efficiently. We further derive upper bounds on the
dynamic regret and constraint violation of AdaSacle, establishing that it
achieves diminishing dynamic regret in terms of time-averaged RDP leakage while
ensuring convergence of FL training to a stationary point. Numerical
experiments on canonical classification tasks show that our approach
effectively reduces RDP and DP leakages compared with state-of-the-art
benchmarks without compromising learning performance.

### [3] [Multi-Modal Multi-Task Semantic Communication: A Distributed Information Bottleneck Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04000)
*Yujie Zhou,Yiwei Liao,Cheng Peng,Yong Xiao,Yingyu Li*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出PoM$^2$-DIB框架，通过扩展分布式信息瓶颈理论，引入模态选择机制来解决多模态多任务语义通信中的冗余传输问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于AI的多模态多任务语义通信方案要求发射端拥有完整模态数据参与所有接收端任务，导致冗余传输并与信道容量和计算能力的物理限制相冲突。

Method: 扩展分布式信息瓶颈理论，引入模态选择作为关键设计变量；将模态选择松弛为概率形式，使用评分函数估计和公共随机性实现分布式设备的可优化协调决策。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验结果表明，PoM$^2$-DIB在各种任务中，在物理限制下相比全参与基线实现了较高的推理质量。

Conclusion: PoM$^2$-DIB框架通过模态选择和分布式信息瓶颈编码，在遵循物理约束的同时实现了通信效率与推理质量的有效权衡。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) shifts the focus from data transmission to
meaning delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication.
  Existing AI-based coding schemes for multi-modal multi-task SemCom often
require transmitters with full-modal data to participate in all receivers'
tasks, which leads to redundant transmissions and conflicts with the physical
limits of channel capacity and computational capability.
  In this paper, we propose PoM$^2$-DIB, a novel framework that extends the
distributed information bottleneck (DIB) theory to address this problem.
  Unlike the typical DIB, this framework introduces modality selection as an
additional key design variable, enabling a more flexible tradeoff between
communication rate and inference quality.
  This extension selects only the most relevant modalities for task
participation, adhering to the physical constraints, while following efficient
DIB-based coding.
  To optimize selection and coding end-to-end, we relax modality selection into
a probabilistic form, allowing the use of score function estimation with common
randomness to enable optimizable coordinated decisions across distributed
devices.
  Experimental results on public datasets verify that PoM$^2$-DIB achieves high
inference quality compared to full-participation baselines in various tasks
under physical limits.

### [4] [Volume-Based Lower Bounds to the Capacity of the Gaussian Channel Under Pointwise Additive Input Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04095)
*Neri Merhav,Shlomo Shamai*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种针对高斯信道在点式加性输入约束下的容量下界方法，适用于连续和离散输入字母表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高斯信道在点式加性输入约束下的容量下界问题，这类约束在实际应用中很常见，但现有研究多关注期望约束而非点式约束。

Method: 使用两种方法：基于熵功率不等式(EPI)的方法仅适用于连续输入；基于互信息直接处理的方法更通用，适用于离散和连续输入，但技术更复杂。两种方法都利用类型方法扩展、鞍点积分和大偏差理论来精确计算约束输入集的体积指数。

Result: 提出了两类容量下界，第二类方法产生更强更紧的下界。提供了数值示例验证两种下界的有效性。

Conclusion: 开发了统一且相对简单的高斯信道容量下界方法，特别适用于点式加性输入约束场景，为实际通信系统设计提供了理论工具。

Abstract: We present a family of relatively simple and unified lower bounds on the
capacity of the Gaussian channel under a set of pointwise additive input
constraints. Specifically, the admissible channel input vectors $\bx = (x_1,
\ldots, x_n)$ must satisfy $k$ additive cost constraints of the form
$\sum_{i=1}^n \phi_j(x_i) \le n \Gamma_j$, $j = 1,2,\ldots,k$, which are
enforced pointwise for every $\bx$, rather than merely in expectation. More
generally, we also consider cost functions that depend on a sliding window of
fixed length $m$, namely, $\sum_{i=m}^n \phi_j(x_i, x_{i-1}, \ldots, x_{i-m+1})
\le n \Gamma_j$, $j = 1,2,\ldots,k$, a formulation that naturally accommodates
correlation constraints as well as a broad range of other constraints of
practical relevance. We propose two classes of lower bounds, derived by two
methodologies that both rely on the exact evaluation of the volume exponent
associated with the set of input vectors satisfying the given constraints. This
evaluation exploits extensions of the method of types to continuous alphabets,
the saddle-point method of integration, and basic tools from large deviations
theory. The first class of bounds is obtained via the entropy power inequality
(EPI), and therefore applies exclusively to continuous-valued inputs. The
second class, by contrast, is more general, and it applies to discrete input
alphabets as well. It is based on a direct manipulation of mutual information,
and it yields stronger and tighter bounds, though at the cost of greater
technical complexity. Numerical examples illustrating both types of bounds are
provided, and several extensions and refinements are also discussed.

### [5] [Optimal frames for Phase Retrieval from Edge Vectors of Optimal Polygons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04099)
*Zhiqiang Xu,Zili Xu,Xinyue Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文揭示了二维实空间中相位恢复最优框架与1922年Reinhardt提出的周长最大化等直径问题之间的联系，证明了每个周长最大化等直径问题的最优解都对应一个相位恢复最优框架，并完全刻画了当m≥3且包含奇数因子时的所有最优框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究相位恢复的最优框架特性，探索相位恢复与离散几何之间的联系，为相位恢复领域提供新视角，同时推进周长最大化等直径问题的研究。

Method: 通过将最优多边形问题重新表述为关于单位根差异的问题来刻画所有最优多边形，建立相位恢复最优框架与周长最大化等直径问题之间的数学联系。

Result: 证明了每个周长最大化等直径问题的最优解都对应一个相位恢复最优框架，完全刻画了当m≥3且包含奇数因子时的所有最优框架，并发现谐波框架Em在m≥4的偶数时不最优，推翻了Xia等人的猜想。

Conclusion: 成功建立了相位恢复最优框架与周长最大化等直径问题之间的深刻联系，为相位恢复理论提供了新的几何视角，同时解决了关于谐波框架最优性的重要猜想。

Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval,
defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its
minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the
connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the
perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in
1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the
perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame
in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning
the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons.
Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$
vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd
factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m$ is {\em not}
optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture
proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu (Math. Comp., 90(356): 2931-2960). Previous work
has established that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is indeed
optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.
  Exploring the connection between phase retrieval and discrete geometry, this
paper aims to illuminate advancements in phase retrieval and offer new
perspectives on the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.

### [6] [Multiplicative Turing Ensembles, Pareto's Law, and Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04167)
*Alexander Kolpakov,Aidan Rocke*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究整数乘法动力学，引入乘法图灵系综(MTE)，将Elias Omega码长作为能量函数，通过最大熵约束得到整数和素数的吉布斯先验分布，并证明该分布在温和尾部假设下产生指数尾部和对数乘子的帕累托尾部。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究由独立同分布素数乘子驱动的整数乘法动力学，并将其宏观统计量与通用码长联系起来，探索从概率图灵机系综中自然产生的乘法图灵系综。

Method: 采用变分建模原则，以Elias Omega码长为能量函数，施加最大熵约束得到整数和素数的规范吉布斯先验分布，分析该分布在温和尾部假设下的统计特性。

Result: 理论证明该先验分布在温和尾部假设下产生对数乘子的指数尾部(含缓慢变化修正)和加法间隙的帕累托尾部，并证明了MTE轨迹上Omega码长的时间平均定律。在Debian和PyPI包大小数据集上，缩放Omega先验实现了对码长直方图的最低KL散度。

Conclusion: 理论与数据比较表明存在定性分裂：机器适应机制(吉布斯对齐，有限一阶矩)表现出清晰的平均行为，而人类生成的复杂性似乎超出此机制，具有足够重的尾部以产生无界一阶矩，因此无法实现同类平均。

Abstract: We study integer-valued multiplicative dynamics driven by i.i.d. prime
multipliers and connect their macroscopic statistics to universal codelengths.
We introduce the Multiplicative Turing Ensemble (MTE) and show how it arises
naturally - though not uniquely - from ensembles of probabilistic Turing
machines. Our modeling principle is variational: taking Elias' Omega codelength
as an energy and imposing maximum entropy constraints yields a canonical Gibbs
prior on integers and, by restriction, on primes. Under mild tail assumptions,
this prior induces exponential tails for log-multipliers (up to slowly varying
corrections), which in turn generate Pareto tails for additive gaps. We also
prove time-average laws for the Omega codelength along MTE trajectories.
Empirically, on Debian and PyPI package size datasets, a scaled Omega prior
achieves the lowest KL divergence against codelength histograms. Taken
together, the theory-data comparison suggests a qualitative split:
machine-adapted regimes (Gibbs-aligned, finite first moment) exhibit clean
averaging behavior, whereas human-generated complexity appears to sit beyond
this regime, with tails heavy enough to produce an unbounded first moment, and
therefore no averaging of the same kind.

### [8] [Compressed Newton-direction-based Thresholding Methods for Sparse Optimization Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04451)
*Nan Meng,Yun-Bin Zhao*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了基于压缩牛顿方向的阈值追踪算法（CNHTP和CNOTP），通过将牛顿步限制在低维子空间并嵌入全空间，显著降低计算成本，同时保持牛顿类方法的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏优化问题中的阈值算法包含搜索方向和阈值策略两个关键组件，现有方法在计算效率和收敛性方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 使用压缩牛顿方向作为搜索方向，通过限制牛顿步到低维子空间并嵌入全空间，结合硬阈值或最优阈值策略，提出CNHTP和CNOTP算法。

Result: 在受限等距性质下建立了算法的全局收敛性，实验结果表明在成功频率和解精度方面与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 压缩牛顿方向方法有效平衡了计算成本与效率，提出的算法在稀疏优化问题中表现出色。

Abstract: Thresholding algorithms for sparse optimization problems involve two key
components: search directions and thresholding strategies. In this paper, we
use the compressed Newton direction as a search direction, derived by confining
the classical Newton step to a low-dimensional subspace and embedding it back
into the full space with diagonal regularization. This approach significantly
reduces the computational cost for finding the search direction while
maintaining the efficiency of Newton-like methods. Based on this new search
direction, we propose two major classes of algorithms by adopting hard or
optimal thresholding: the compressed Newton-direction-based thresholding
pursuit (CNHTP) and compressed Newton-direction-based optimal thresholding
pursuit (CNOTP). We establish the global convergence of the proposed algorithms
under the restricted isometry property. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithms perform comparably to several state-of-the-art methods
in terms of success frequency and solution accuracy for solving the sparse
optimization problem.

*Jian Xiao,Ji Wang,Qi Sun,Qimei Cui,Xingwang Li,Dusit Niyato,Chih-Lin I*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出使用傅里叶神经算子（FNO）来解决下一代MIMO系统中的物理层信号处理挑战，该算子能够学习无限维函数空间之间的映射，特别适合建模电磁波传播的复杂物理系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代MIMO系统引入了极大规模阵列、全息表面、三维架构和柔性天线等新技术，但同时也带来了复杂的近场传播、连续孔径建模、亚波长天线耦合效应和动态信道条件等挑战。传统的基于模型和深度学习的方法在这些新机制中面临巨大计算复杂度和模型不准确的问题。

Method: 采用傅里叶神经算子（FNO），它能够学习无限维函数空间之间的函数到函数映射，通过傅里叶域高效捕捉全局依赖关系，具有网格无关的特性，特别适合基于电磁波传播的偏微分方程建模。

Result: 在新型MIMO架构的信道建模和估计案例研究中，FNO相比最先进方法展现出优越性能。

Conclusion: FNO是实现下一代MIMO系统巨大潜力的有前景技术，文章还讨论了开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Next-generation multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, characterized
by extremely large-scale arrays, holographic surfaces, three-dimensional
architectures, and flexible antennas, are poised to deliver unprecedented data
rates, spectral efficiency and stability. However, these advancements introduce
significant challenges for physical layer signal processing, stemming from
complex near-field propagation, continuous aperture modeling, sub-wavelength
antenna coupling effects, and dynamic channel conditions. Conventional
model-based and deep learning approaches often struggle with the immense
computational complexity and model inaccuracies inherent in these new regimes.
This article proposes a Fourier neural operator (FNO) as a powerful and
promising tool to address these challenges. The FNO learns function-to-function
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, making them
exceptionally well-suited for modeling complex physical systems governed by
partial differential equations based on electromagnetic wave propagation. We
first present the fundamental principles of FNO, demonstrating its mesh-free
nature and function-to-function ability to efficiently capture global
dependencies in the Fourier domain. Furthermore, we explore a range of
applications of FNO in physical-layer signal processing for next-generation
MIMO systems. Representative case studies on channel modeling and estimation
for novel MIMO architectures demonstrate the superior performance of FNO
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and
outline future research directions, positioning FNO as a promising technology
for enabling the enormous potential of next-generation MIMO systems.

### [10] [Multi-Agent Distributed Optimization With Feasible Set Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05068)
*Shreya Meel,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究去中心化约束优化问题，多个代理在保持各自可行集私密的前提下联合学习最优解集。提出在环状和星状网络结构下实现名义信息泄露的可行方案，并分析通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多代理协作优化时保护个体可行集隐私的问题，避免传统私有集合交集协议导致的信息泄露超过名义水平。

Method: 设计通信协议，领导者通过向非领导者发送查询和接收答案来搜索解集，确保信息泄露仅限于解集本身。分析环状和星状两种网络拓扑下的实现方案。

Result: 证明如果领导者先通过现有PSI协议学习联合可行集再推导解集，信息泄露会超过名义水平。提出的方案在大多数情况下比通过PSI检索整个可行集更通信高效。

Conclusion: 成功开发了在名义信息泄露下获取解集的可行方案，建立了与阈值PSI的联系，并展示了在随机目标函数映射下的通信效率优势。

Abstract: We consider the problem of decentralized constrained optimization with
multiple agents $E_1,\ldots,E_N$ who jointly wish to learn the optimal solution
set while keeping their feasible sets $\mathcal{P}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{P}_N$
private from each other. We assume that the objective function $f$ is known to
all agents and each feasible set is a collection of points from a universal
alphabet $\mathcal{P}_{alph}$. A designated agent (leader) starts the
communication with the remaining (non-leader) agents, and is the first to
retrieve the solution set. The leader searches for the solution by sending
queries to and receiving answers from the non-leaders, such that the
information on the individual feasible sets revealed to the leader should be no
more than nominal, i.e., what is revealed from learning the solution set alone.
We develop achievable schemes for obtaining the solution set at nominal
information leakage, and characterize their communication costs under two
communication setups between agents. In this work, we focus on two kinds of
network setups: i) ring, where each agent communicates with two adjacent
agents, and ii) star, where only the leader communicates with the remaining
agents. We show that, if the leader first learns the joint feasible set through
an existing private set intersection (PSI) protocol and then deduces the
solution set, the information leaked to the leader is greater than nominal.
Moreover, we draw connection of our schemes to threshold PSI (ThPSI), which is
a PSI-variant where the intersection is revealed only when its cardinality is
larger than a threshold value. Finally, for various realizations of $f$ mapped
uniformly at random to a fixed range of values, our schemes are more
communication-efficient with a high probability compared to retrieving the
entire feasible set through PSI.

*Boyang Chen,Mohd Tasleem Khan,George Goussetis,Mathini Sellathurai,Yuan Ding,João F. C. Mota*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: COMET框架通过偏移二进制编码技术优化CNN设计，实现性能与资源利用的协同优化，显著降低FPGA资源消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN在低功耗边缘设备上部署时面临的计算密集和硬件依赖挑战

Method: 采用偏移二进制编码表示输入和权重，利用位宽不对称性，改进移位累加操作，并引入四种新颖的LUT技术

Result: FPGA评估显示相比现有LeNet-5 CNN设计显著减少资源利用，对精度影响极小

Conclusion: COMET框架为边缘设备上的CNN部署提供了高效的硬件优化解决方案

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for computer vision
and pattern recognition tasks; however, their computational intensity and
reliance on hardware such as FPGAs pose challenges for deployment on low-power
edge devices. In this work, we present COMET, a framework of CNN designs that
employ efficient hardware offset-binary coding (OBC) techniques to enable
co-optimization of performance and resource utilization. The approach
formulates CNN inference with OBC representations of inputs (Scheme A) and
weights (Scheme B) separately, enabling exploitation of bit-width asymmetry.
The shift-accumulate operation is modified by incorporating the offset term
with the pre-scaled bias. Leveraging inherent symmetries in Schemes A and B, we
introduce four novel look-up table (LUT) techniques -- parallel, shared, split,
and hybrid -- and analyze them to identify the most efficient options. Building
on this foundation, we develop an OBC-based general matrix multiplication core
using the im2col transformation, enabling efficient acceleration of a
fixed-point modified LeNet-5 model. FPGA evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed co-optimization approach significantly reduces resource utilization
compared to state-of-the-art LeNet-5 based CNN designs, with minimal impact on
accuracy.

TL;DR: 将可变块相关模型(VBCM)应用于流体天线系统(FAS)安全分析，开发了新的闭式表达式和优化算法，显著提高了分析精度和系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Jakes模型分析困难，而简化的恒定相关模型无法准确捕捉FAS端口间的空间相关性，这给6G无线通信中的安全分析带来挑战。

Method: 应用VBCM模型到FAS安全分析，推导平均保密容量(ASC)和保密中断概率(SOP)的闭式表达式，并设计了网格搜索和梯度下降两种优化算法。

Result: VBCM框架实现了与仿真一致的精度，相对误差低于5%，在高威胁场景下ASC提升超过120%，紧凑天线配置下性能提升18-19%。

Conclusion: VBCM为FAS安全分析和优化提供了强大工具，对推进6G通信系统具有重要实践价值。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) are emerging as a transformative enabler for
sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, providing unprecedented spatial
diversity through dynamic reconfiguration of antenna ports. However, the
inherent spatial correlation among ports poses significant challenges for
accurate analysis. Conventional models such as Jakes are analytically
intractable, while oversimplified constant-correlation models fail to capture
the true behavior. In this work, we address these challenges by applying the
variable block-correlation model (VBCM) -- originally proposed by
Ram\'{i}rez-Espinosa \textit{et al.} in 2024 -- to FAS security analysis, and
by developing comprehensive optimization methods to enhance analytical
accuracy. We derive new closed-form expressions for average secrecy capacity
(ASC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP), demonstrating that the VBCM
framework achieves simulation-aligned accuracy, with relative errors
consistently below $5\%$ (compared to $10$--$15\%$ for constant-correlation
models). To maximize ASC, we further design two algorithms: a grid search (GS)
method and a gradient descent (GD) method. Numerical results reveal that the
VBCM-based approach not only provides reliable insights into FAS security
performance, but also yields substantial gains -- ASC improvements exceeding
$120\%$ in high-threat scenarios and $18$--$19\%$ performance enhancements for
compact antenna configurations. These findings underscore the practical value
of integrating VBCM into FAS security analysis and optimization, establishing
it as a powerful tool for advancing 6G communication systems.

### [13] [On-Grid Equivalence of Continuous-Time Doubly Selective Channels: A Revisit of Bello's Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03626)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了实际物理信道的网格化建模，研究了具有非网格延迟和多普勒频移的双选择性信道的等效网格化DD域表示，扩展了Bello的经典结果以考虑更一般的窗函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的双选择性信道通信研究大多采用网格化DD信道模型，但实际物理信道通常是非网格的，导致实际信道与网格模型之间存在差距。

Method: 研究连续时间双选择性信道在非网格延迟和多普勒频移下的等效网格化DD域表示，考虑收发器端的实际时频域加窗处理。

Result: 获得了适用于窗函数具有有限支撑的通用模型，扩展了Bello的经典结果，使其能够处理更一般的窗函数。

Conclusion: 本文提供了实际物理信道等效网格化建模的理论框架，讨论了等效网格模型的特征和意义。

Abstract: Significant studies on communications over doubly selective channels have
utilized on-grid DD channel models, which are previously investigated in
Bello's seminar paper in 1963. The DD grid is typically specified by the
bandwidth and time duration of the transmission frames. However, the physical
channels are determined by the propagation environments and they are typically
off-grid. Hence, there is often a gap between an actual physical channel and
the on-grid model. This paper revisits the on-grid modeling of practical
physical channels. We study the associated on-grid DD-domain representations
for continuous-time, doubly selective channels with off-grid delay and Doppler
shifts, accounting for practical time/frequency-domain windowing at the
transceivers. The universal models obtained are applicable under the mild
assumption that the windows have finite supports, and they extend Bello's
classical results to account for more general windows. We also discuss the
features and implications of the equivalent on-grid models.

Conclusion: PASS辅助的无蜂窝通信系统通过有效的波束成形优化，在提升系统性能的同时解决了用户数量增加时的性能下降问题。

Abstract: A pinching antenna system (PASS) assisted cell-free communication system is
proposed. A sum rate maximization problem under the BS power budget constraint
and PA deployment constraint is formulated. To tackle the proposed non-convex
optimization problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed.
In particular, the digital beamforming sub-problem is solved using the weighted
minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method, whereas the pinching beamforming
sub-problem is handled via a penalty based approach combined with element-wise
optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the PASS assisted
cell-free systems achieve superior performance over benchmark schemes; 2)
increasing the number of PAs per waveguides can improve the advantage of PASS
assisted cell-free systems; and 3) the cell-free architecture mitigates the
average user rate degradation as the number of users increases.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了多用户多窃听者ISAC系统中的感知辅助安全通信，提出了一种联合传输保密通信信号和专用感知信号的波束成形设计，通过交替优化算法解决和速率最大化问题，并在混合模拟数字阵列架构中扩展应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在集成感知与通信系统中，如何同时服务用户并感知空中窃听者，实现安全通信是一个重要挑战。需要设计有效的波束成形方案来最大化通信速率，同时抑制窃听者的信号接收。

Method: 提出基于分数规划的交替优化算法，利用逐次凸近似和半定松弛处理非凸约束。分析了最小感知波束数量，并将设计扩展到混合模拟数字阵列架构，通过流形优化处理单位模约束。

Result: 仿真结果表明，仅需少量感知波束即可同时实现感知和干扰空中窃听者，所提设计在性能上始终优于强基线方法，并揭示了通信与感知之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为ISAC系统中的安全通信提供了有效的波束成形解决方案，证明了少量专用感知波束的可行性，并在不同阵列架构下均能实现良好的性能表现。

Abstract: In this paper, sensing-assisted secure communication in a multi-user
multi-eavesdropper integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is
investigated. Confidential communication signals and dedicated sensing signals
are jointly transmitted by a base station (BS) to simultaneously serve users
and sense aerial eavesdroppers (AEs). A sum rate maximization problem is
formulated under AEs' Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and
sensing Signal-to-Clutter-plus-Noise Ratio (SCNR) constraints. A
fractional-programming-based alternating optimization algorithm is developed to
solve this problem for fully digital arrays, where successive convex
approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) are leveraged to handle
non-convex constraints. Furthermore, the minimum number of dedicated sensing
beams is analyzed via a worst-case rank bound, upon which the proposed
beamforming design is further extended to the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) array
architecture, where the unit-modulus constraint is addressed by manifold
optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that only a small number of
sensing beams are sufficient for both sensing and jamming AEs, and the proposed
designs consistently outperform strong baselines while also revealing the
communication-sensing trade-off.

Motivation: 心血管疾病是儿科主要健康负担，早期筛查至关重要。心电图作为无创且易获取的工具，非常适合此目的。

Method: 系统评估四种代表性范式：ResNet-1D、BiLSTM、Transformer和Mamba 2，在9导联和12导联配置下进行多标签儿科CVD分类。

Result: 所有模型均取得强结果，汉明损失低至0.0069，大多数设置下F1分数超过85%。ResNet-1D在12导联子集上达到94.67%的宏F1分数，BiLSTM和Transformer也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 该基准建立了可重复的基线，突出了各范式的互补优势，并指出需要更大规模、多中心验证、年龄分层分析和更广泛疾病覆盖，以支持真实世界的儿科ECG应用。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major pediatric health burden, and early
screening is of critical importance. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a
noninvasive and accessible tool, is well suited for this purpose. This paper
presents the first benchmark study of deep learning for multi-label pediatric
CVD classification on the recently released ZZU-pECG dataset, comprising 3716
recordings with 19 CVD categories. We systematically evaluate four
representative paradigms--ResNet-1D, BiLSTM, Transformer, and Mamba 2--under
both 9-lead and 12-lead configurations. All models achieved strong results,
with Hamming Loss as low as 0.0069 and F1-scores above 85% in most settings.
ResNet-1D reached a macro-F1 of 94.67% on the 12-lead subset, while BiLSTM and
Transformer also showed competitive performance. Per-class analysis indicated
challenges for rare conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the
9-lead subset, reflecting the effect of limited positive samples. This
benchmark establishes reusable baselines and highlights complementary strengths
across paradigms. It further points to the need for larger-scale, multi-center
validation, age-stratified analysis, and broader disease coverage to support
real-world pediatric ECG applications.

Abstract: Frequency Range 3 (FR3) in the 7-24 GHz band will be the new spectrum for 6G
wireless networks. The bandwidth availability and diversity of FR3 offer
unprecedented opportunities for coherent multiband Integrated Sensing and
Communications (ISAC), which aggregates the carrier phase information from
multiple frequency bands to increase the sensing resolution to the cm-level.
However, the frequency anisotropy of sensing targets over GHz-wide bands and
the non-contiguity of the 6G spectrum, pose critical challenges to the
application of existing multiband ISAC techniques. We present the first study
on coherent multiband sensing in FR3. We experimentally characterize the
frequency anisotropy of targets and propose new phase coherence metrics for
multiband processing. Then, we analyze the impact of non-contiguous FR3 bands
considered by 3GPP, and design a new algorithm to mitigate the resulting
sensing artifacts, outperforming existing techniques. Our results represent a
first step toward fully developing multiband ISAC for FR3.

Conclusion: 多级源PAC编码框架及其码构造算法能够有效提升短块长场景下的密钥生成性能。

Abstract: Source polar coding is a potential solution for short blocklength-based
low-latency key generation with limited sources, which is a critical aspect of
six generation (6G) Internet of things. However, existing source coding schemes
still suffer from significant degradation in key generation rate and
reconciliation reliability in short blocklength regime. To address this issue,
we introduce a multilevel source polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC)
coding framework. Furthermore, we propose a novel code construction algorithm
that jointly leverages polarization effects and the maximum likelihood (ML)
decoding error coefficient. Simulations demonstrate that the multilevel source
PAC scheme with the proposed code construction achieves superior key generation
rate under key disagreement constraints compared to conventional and multilevel
source polar coding methods even in short blocklength regimes.

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is an effective underground emergency
communication technique after disasters such as landslides, mine collapses, and
earthquakes, due to its advantages in mediums such as soil, concrete, and
metals. However, the propagation mediums in practical MI based underground
emergency communications are usually diverse and composed randomly due to the
impact of disasters, which poses a challenge for MI communication in practical
applications. In this paper, we formulate a statistical fading channel model,
which reflects the random composition of diverse mediums and is shown to follow
a lognormal distribution. To mitigate the impact of diverse medium fading,
Multi-frequency Resonating Compensation (MuReC) based coils are used to achieve
multiband transmission. Then, we analyze the performance of MuReC based
multi-band MI communication with diverse medium fading and derive the
expressions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) probability density functions,
ergodic capacities, average bit error rates (BERs), and outage probabilities
for both multiplexing and diversity cases. Numerical results show that MuReC
based multiband transmission schemes can effectively reduce the impact of
diverse medium fading and enhance the performance.

Abstract: The sum of random variables (RVs) appears extensively in wireless
communications, at large, both conventional and advanced, and has been subject
of longstanding research. The statistical characterization of the referred sum
is crucial to determine the performance of such communications systems.
Although efforts have been undertaken to unveil these sum statistics, e.g.,
probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF),
no general efficient nor manageable solutions capable of evaluating the exact
sum PDF and CDF are available to date. The only formulations are given in terms
of either the multi-fold Brennan's integral or the multivariate Fox H-function.
Unfortunately, these methods are only feasible up to a certain number of RVs,
meaning that when the number of RVs in the sum increases, the computation of
the sum PDF and CDF is subject to stability problems, convergence issues, or
inaccurate results. In this paper, we derive new, simple, exact formulations
for the PDF and CDF of the sum of L independent and identically distributed
{\alpha}-{\mu} RVs. Unlike the available solutions, the computational
complexity of our analytical expressions is independent of the number of
summands. Capitalizing on our unprecedented findings, we analyze, in exact and
asymptotic manners, the performance of L-branch pre-detection equal-gain
combining and maximal-ratio combining receivers over {\alpha}-{\mu} fading
environments. The coding and diversity gains of the system for both receivers
are analyzed and quantified. Moreover, numerical simulations show that the
computation time reduces drastically when using our expressions, which are
arguably the most efficient and manageable formulations derived so far.

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is an effective underground emergency
communication technique after disasters such as landslides, mine collapses, and
earthquakes, due to its advantages in mediums such as soil, concrete, and
metals. Based on channel state information (CSI), magnetic beamforming can
significantly improve the performance of MI communication. However, in
post-disaster underground communication, channel estimation may suffer from
errors due to factors such as complex environmental interferences. Taking
channel estimation error into account, we formulate a beamforming optimization
problem for multi-user MI underground emergency communications, which aims to
minimize the power consumption under the constraints of sum rate and signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of each user. Based on the worst-case
optimization criterion and the S-procedure, the non-convex optimization problem
is transformed into convex and solved. Numerical results show that the proposed
robust beamforming scheme can effectively enhance communication reliability and
effective throughput in the presence of channel estimation errors.

Method: 分析解调矩阵对噪声白化能力的影响，该能力与矩阵稀疏度相关，并通过仿真验证性能差异。

Result: AFDM的解调矩阵通常比其他波形的矩阵稀疏度更低，因此在非白噪声环境下表现优于OTFS和OFDM，在大多数应用场景中增益超过1dB。

Conclusion: AFDM在非白高斯噪声环境下具有更好的鲁棒性，适合窄带信号或与OFDM信号共存的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of affine frequency division
multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation
schemes against non-white Gaussian noise, which can model various sources of
additive disturbances to the received signal. The proposed approach
demonstrates that the performance of these waveforms depends on the ability of
the demodulation matrix to whiten the noise-a property that is, in turn,
related to the sparsity of the matrix. AFDM is shown to outperform OTFS and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as its demodulation matrix
is generally less sparse than those of the other waveforms. Based on this
analysis, several application examples and use cases are presented, such as the
use of AFDM and OTFS in narrowband signals or in coexistence with OFDM signals.
Finally, simulation results confirm that AFDM achieves better performance than
OTFS and OFDM in the presence of non-white noise, with gains exceeding 1 dB in
most application scenarios.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法成功扩展了传统估计框架，能够同时估计位置、速度和加速度，为移动目标跟踪提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: This letter presents a novel method for estimating the position, velocity,
and acceleration of a moving target using range-based measurements. Although
most existing studies focus on position and velocity estimation, the framework
of this letter is extended to include acceleration. To achieve this, we propose
using the derivative of the range rate, in addition to the range and range rate
measurements. The proposed method estimates the position at first using
Time-of-Arrival (TOA)-based techniques; then, develops a reformulated least
squares (LS) and weighted least squares (WLS) approaches for velocity
estimation; and finally, employs the derivative of the range rate to estimate
the acceleration using previous position and velocity estimates. On the other
hand, closed-form LS and WLS solutions are derived for both velocity and
acceleration. The simulation results show that the proposed approach provides
improved performance in estimating moving target kinematics compared to
existing methods.

Conclusion: CLEAR方法在传感器数量最少的情况下实现了高效定位，特别适合无人机跟踪和智能交通等物联网应用。

Abstract: This paper presents CLEAR -- a closed-form localization estimator with a
reduced sensor network. The proposed method is a computationally efficient,
two-stage estimator that fuses time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and
frequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) measurements with a minimal number of
sensors. CLEAR localizes a moving source in N-dimensional space using only N+1
sensors, achieving the theoretical minimum sensor count. The first stage
introduces auxiliary range and range-rate parameters to construct a set of
pseudo-linear equations, solved via weighted least squares. An algebraic
elimination using Sylvester's resultant then reduces the problem to a quartic
equation, yielding closed-form estimates for the nuisance variables. A second,
lightweight linear refinement stage is applied to mitigate residual bias. Under
mild Gaussian noise assumptions, the estimator's position and velocity
estimates are statistically efficient, closely approaching the Cramer-Rao lower
bound (CRLB). Extensive Monte Carlo simulations in 2-D and 3-D scenarios
demonstrate CRLB-level accuracy and consistent performance gains over
representative two-stage and iterative baselines, confirming the method's high
suitability for power-constrained, distributed Internet of Things (IoT)
applications such as UAV tracking and smart transportation.

Motivation: 解决在相位相干分布式MIMO通信网络下行链路中集成多基地相干成像功能的挑战，需要在最大化用户频谱效率的同时实现成像功能，这要求部分AP作为接收器工作，且发射AP需发射AP特定的正交信号。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating multistatic coherent
imaging functionalities in the downlink (DL) of a phase-coherent distributed
multiple input multiple output (D-MIMO) communication network. During DL, the
D-MIMO access points (APs) jointly precode the transmitted signals to maximize
the spectral efficiency (SE) at the users (UEs) locations. However, imaging
requires that \textit{(i)} a fraction of the APs work as receivers for sensing
and \textit{(ii)} the transmitting APs emit AP-specific and orthogonal signals
to illuminate the area to be imaged and allow multistatic operation. In these
settings, our contribution is twofold. We propose a novel distributed
integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC) system that superposes a
purposely designed AP-specific signal for imaging to the legacy UE-specific
communication one, with a tunable trade-off factor. We detail both the imaging
waveform design according to the \textit{extended orthogonality condition} and
the space-frequency precoder design. Then, we propose an optimized selection
strategy for the receiving APs, in order to maximize imaging performance under
half-duplex constraints. Extensive numerical results prove the feasibility and
benefits of our proposal, materializing the potential of joint multistatic
imaging and communications in practical D-MIMO deployments.

Motivation: 现有模型在太赫兹通信中难以处理严重的频率选择性和多径效应，需要更准确的信道模型来支持6G室内网络应用。

Method: 采用物理基础的Rician衰落模型，结合确定性LOS和随机性NLOS组件，使用频率相关衰减参数，集成双射线反射框架捕获驻波现象，并通过宽带频谱平均减轻频率选择性。

Result: 在208 GHz载波频率下，模型实现了低至2.54 dB的RMSE，比自由空间路径损耗模型性能提升14.2%，带宽增加时RMSE降低73.3%。

Conclusion: 带宽在抑制振荡伪影和提高建模精度方面至关重要，该方法为太赫兹系统设计提供了坚实基础，支持6G室内无线应用。

Abstract: Accurate channel modeling is essential for realizing the potential of
terahertz (THz) communications in 6G indoor networks, where existing models
struggle with severe frequency selectivity and multipath effects. We propose a
physically grounded Rician fading channel model that jointly incorporates
deterministic line-of-sight (LOS) and stochastic non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
components, enhanced by frequency-dependent attenuation characterized by
optimized exponents alpha and beta. Unlike conventional approaches, our model
integrates a two-ray reflection framework to capture standing wave phenomena
and employs wideband spectral averaging to mitigate frequency selectivity over
bandwidths up to 15 GHz. Empirical measurements at a 208 GHz carrier, spanning
0.1-0.9 m, demonstrate that our model achieves root mean square errors (RMSE)
as low as 2.54 dB, outperforming free-space path loss (FSPL) by up to 14.2% and
reducing RMSE by 73.3% as bandwidth increases. These findings underscore the
importance of bandwidth in suppressing oscillatory artifacts and improving
modeling accuracy. Our approach provides a robust foundation for THz system
design, supporting reliable indoor wireless personal area networks (WPANs),
device-to-device (D2D) communications, and precise localization in future 6G
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决6G网络中多模态ML模型在域偏移下泛化能力差的问题，因为实际无线系统经常面临信道统计变化、移动障碍物等导致的分布差异。

Method: 第一阶段使用基于物理的损失函数学习无线环境物理特性；第二阶段提出协作域适应，通过域相似性感知的模型聚合来利用多个基站的知识。

Result: 基于物理的训练仅需13%的数据样本就能达到不使用物理训练的基线性能；协作域适应仅需25%的数据和20%的FLOPs就能收敛。

Conclusion: 该框架在稀缺多模态数据下显著提高了无线网络ML模型的泛化能力，为6G动态环境中的智能决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In 6G wireless networks, multi-modal ML models can be leveraged to enable
situation-aware network decisions in dynamic environments. However, trained ML
models often fail to generalize under domain shifts when training and test data
distributions are different because they often focus on modality-specific
spurious features. In practical wireless systems, domain shifts occur
frequently due to dynamic channel statistics, moving obstacles, or hardware
configuration. Thus, there is a need for learning frameworks that can achieve
robust generalization under scarce multi-modal data in wireless networks. In
this paper, a novel and data-efficient two-phase learning framework is proposed
to improve generalization performance in unseen and unfamiliar wireless
environments with minimal amount of multi-modal data. In the first stage, a
physics-based loss function is employed to enable each BS to learn the physics
underlying its wireless environment captured by multi-modal data. The
data-efficiency of the physics-based loss function is analytically
investigated. In the second stage, collaborative domain adaptation is proposed
to leverage the wireless environment knowledge of multiple BSs to guide
under-performing BSs under domain shift. Specifically, domain-similarity-aware
model aggregation is proposed to utilize the knowledge of BSs that experienced
similar domains. To validate the proposed framework, a new dataset generation
framework is developed by integrating CARLA and MATLAB-based mmWave channel
modeling to predict mmWave RSS. Simulation results show that the proposed
physics-based training requires only 13% of data samples to achieve the same
performance as a state-of-the-art baseline that does not use physics-based
training. Moreover, the proposed collaborative domain adaptation needs only 25%
of data samples and 20% of FLOPs to achieve the convergence compared to
baselines.

Abstract: Memristor crossbars enable vector-matrix multiplication (VMM), and are
promising for low-power applications. However, it can be difficult to write the
memristor conductance values exactly. To improve the accuracy of VMM, we
propose a scheme based on low-rank matrix approximation. Specifically, singular
value decomposition (SVD) is first applied to obtain a low-rank approximation
of the target matrix, which is then factored into a pair of smaller matrices.
Subsequently, a two-step serial VMM is executed, where the stochastic write
errors are mitigated through step-wise averaging. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed scheme, we derive a general expression for the resulting
computation error and provide an asymptotic analysis under a prescribed
singular-value profile, which reveals how the error scales with matrix size and
rank. Both analytical and numerical results confirm the superiority of the
proposed scheme compared with the benchmark scheme.

Abstract: In recent decades Human Body Communication has emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional radio wave communication, utilizing the body's
conductive properties for low-power connectivity among wearables. This method
harnesses the human body as an energy-efficient channel for data transmission
within the electro-quasistatic frequency range, enabling advancements in
human-machine interaction. While prior work has noted the role of parasitic
return paths in such capacitively coupled systems, the influence of surrounding
metallic objects on these paths, which are critical for EQS wireless signaling,
has not been fully explored. This paper fills that gap with a structured study
of how various conducting objects, from non-grounded (floating) metals and
grounded metals to enclosed metallic environments such as elevators and cars,
affect the body-communication channel. We present a theoretical framework
supported by finite element method simulations and experiments with wearable
devices. Results show that metallic objects within 20 cm of devices can reduce
transmission loss by about 10 dB. When a device ground connects to a grounded
metallic object, channel gain can increase by at least 20 dB. Contact area
during touch-based interactions with grounded metals produces contact-impedance
dependent high-pass channel characteristics. Proximity to metallic objects
introduces variability within a critical distance, with grounded metals
producing a larger overall effect than floating metals. These findings improve
understanding of body-centric communication links and inform design for
healthcare, consumer electronics, defense, and industrial applications.

Abstract: Caching is crucial in hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks to reduce
latency, optimize throughput, and improve data availability by storing
frequently accessed content closer to users, especially in bandwidth-limited
satellite systems, requiring strategic Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. This
paper addresses throughput optimization in satellite-terrestrial integrated
networks through opportunistic cooperative caching. We propose a joint probing
and scheduling strategy to enhance content retrieval efficiency. The strategy
leverages the LEO satellite to probe satellite-to-ground links and cache states
of multiple cooperative terrestrial stations, enabling dynamic user scheduling
for content delivery. Using an optimal stopping theoretic approach with two
levels of incomplete information, we make real-time decisions on
satellite-terrestrial hybrid links and caching probing. Our threshold-based
strategy optimizes probing and scheduling, significantly improving average
system throughput by exploiting cooperative caching, satellite-terrestrial link
transmission, and time diversity from dynamic user requests. Simulation results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed strategies.

Abstract: Holographic MIMO (HMIMO) has emerged as a promising solution for future
wireless systems by enabling ultra-dense, spatially continuous antenna
deployments. While prior studies have primarily focused on electromagnetic (EM)
modeling or simulation-based performance analysis, a rigorous
communication-theoretic framework remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents the first analytical performance study of a multi-user HMIMO downlink
system with matched filter (MF) precoding - a low-complexity baseline scheme.
By incorporating multipath propagation, mutual coupling, and element
excitation, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the MF
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) using an equivalent random
variable model. Leveraging bivariate gamma distributions, we then develop
tractable throughput approximations under full, partial, and no channel state
information (CSI) scenarios. Additionally, we formulate a max-min beamforming
problem to benchmark optimal user fairness performance. Numerical results
validate the accuracy of the proposed framework and reveal that MF precoding
achieves competitive performance with strong robustness to low SINR and CSI
uncertainty.

Abstract: Networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained significant
attention as a promising technology for enabling next-generation wireless
systems. To further enhance networked ISAC, delegating the reception of sensing
signals to dedicated target monitoring terminals (TMTs) instead of base
stations (BSs) offers significant advantages in terms of sensing capability and
deployment flexibility. Despite its potential, the coordinated beamforming
design for networked integrated communication and time-of-arrival (ToA)-based
multi-TMT localization remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive study to fill this gap. Specifically, we first establish signal
models for both communication and localization, and, for the first time, derive
a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize the localization
performance. Subsequently, we exploit this CRLB to formulate two optimization
problems, focusing on sensing-centric and communication-centric criteria,
respectively. For the sensing-centric problem, we develop a globally optimal
algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) when each BS is equipped with
more antennas than the total number of communication users. While for the
communication-centric problem, we design a globally optimal algorithm for the
single-BS case using bisection search. For the general case of both problems,
we propose a unified successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm,
which is suboptimal yet efficient, and further extend it from single-target
scenarios to more practical multi-target scenarios. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, reveal the intrinsic
performance trade-offs between communication and localization, and further show
that deploying more TMTs is always preferable to deploying more BSs in
networked ISAC systems.

Abstract: Unitary matrices are the basis of a large number of signal processing
applications. In many of these applications, finding ways to efficiently store,
and even transmit these matrices, can significantly reduce memory and
throughput requirements. In this work, we study the problem of efficient
transmission and storage of unitary matrices. Specifically, we explicitly
derive a dimensionally-efficient parametrization (DEP) for unitary matrices
that allows identifying them with sequences of real numbers, where the
dimension coincides with the dimension of the unitary group where they lie. We
also characterize its inverse map that allows retrieving the original unitary
matrices from their DEP. The proposed approach effectively allows halving the
dimension with respect to naively considering all the entries of each unitary
matrix, thus reducing the resources required to store and transmit these
matrices. Furthermore, we show that the sequence of real numbers associated to
the proposed DEP is bounded, and we delimit the interval where these numbers
are contained, facilitating the implementation of quantization approaches with
limited distortion. On the other hand, we outline ways to further reduce the
dimension of the DEP when considering more restrictive constraints for matrices
that show up in certain applications. The numerical results showcase the
potential of the proposed approach in general settings, as well as in three
specific applications of current interest for wireless communications research.

Abstract: In this work, we study a multi-user NTN in which a satellite serves as the
primary network and a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) operates as the
secondary network, acting as a cognitive radio. To reduce the cost, complexity,
and power consumption of conventional antenna arrays, we equip the HAPS with a
transmissive BD-RIS antenna front end. We then formulate a joint optimization
problem for the BD-RIS phase response and the HAPS transmit power allocation
under strict per-user interference temperature constraints. To tackle the
resulting highly nonconvex problem, we propose an alternating-optimization
framework: the power-allocation subproblem admits a closed-form,
water-filling-type solution derived from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions, while the BD-RIS configuration is refined via Riemannian manifold
optimization. Simulation results show significant gains in data rate and
interference suppression over diagonal RIS-assisted benchmarks, establishing
BD-RIS as a promising enabler for future multilayer NTNs.

Abstract: One of the main challenges facing Internet of Things (IoT) networks is
managing interference caused by the large number of devices communicating
simultaneously, particularly in multi-cluster networks where multiple devices
simultaneously transmit to their respective receiver. Over-the-Air Computation
(AirComp) has emerged as a promising solution for efficient real-time data
aggregation, yet its performance suffers in dense, interference-limited
environments. To address this, we propose a novel Interference Alignment (IA)
scheme tailored for up-link AirComp systems. Unlike previous approaches, the
proposed method scales to an arbitrary number $\sf K$ of clusters and enables
each cluster to exploit half of the available channels, instead of only
$\tfrac{1}{\sf K}$ as in time-sharing. In addition, we develop schemes tailored
to scenarios where users are shared between adjacent clusters.

Abstract: In every imaging or sensing application, the physical hardware creates
constraints that must be overcome or they limit system performance. Techniques
that leverage additional degrees of freedom can effectively extend performance
beyond the inherent physical capabilities of the hardware. An example includes
synchronizing distributed sensors so as to synthesize a larger aperture for
remote sensing applications. An additional example is integrating the
communication and sensing functions in a wireless system through the clever
design of waveforms and optimized resource management. As these technologies
mature beyond the conceptual and prototype phase they will ultimately
transition to the commercial market. Here, standards play a critical role in
ensuring success. Standards ensure interoperability between systems
manufactured by different vendors and define industry best practices for
vendors and customers alike. The Signal Processing Society of the Institute for
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) plays a leading role in developing
high-quality standards for computational sensing technologies through the
working groups of the Synthetic Aperture Standards Committee (SASC). In this
column we highlight the standards activities of the P3383 Performance Metrics

Motivation: 研究扩散过程在拉普拉斯正则化设计的初始模式下可能偏离的程度，特别是在阵列波束成形等应用中，需要确保稳态扩散不会过度偏离初始模式。

Conclusion: 该研究为拉普拉斯正则化设计的扩散过程提供了严格的稳态偏差界限，为实际应用中的参数选择提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We study how far a diffusion process on a graph can drift from a designed
starting pattern when that pattern is produced using Laplacian regularisation.
Under standard stability conditions for undirected, entrywise nonnegative
graphs, we give a closed-form, instance-specific upper bound on the
steady-state spread, measured as the relative change between the final and
initial profiles. The bound separates two effects: (i) an irreducible term
determined by the graph's maximum node degree, and (ii) a design-controlled
term that shrinks as the regularisation strength increases (following an
inverse square-root law). This leads to a simple design rule: given any target
limit on spread, one can choose a sufficient regularisation strength in closed
form. Although one motivating application is array beamforming, where the
initial pattern is the squared magnitude of the beamformer weights, the result
applies to any scenario that first enforces Laplacian smoothness and then
evolves by linear diffusion on a graph. Overall, the guarantee is
non-asymptotic, easy to compute, and certifies how much steady-state deviation
can occur.
