We propose two GenAI based approaches, generative conditional diffusion model (GCDM) and generative conditional diffusion implicit model (GCDIM), leveraging the diffusion model conditioned on dynamic CSI to maximize the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the system. To benchmark performance, we compare the proposed GenAI based approaches against an expert algorithm, traditionally known for achieving near-optimal solutions at the cost of computational efficiency. The simulation results demonstrate that GCDM matches the sum SE achieved by the expert algorithm while significantly reducing the computational overhead. Furthermore, GCDIM achieves a comparable sum SE with an additional $98\\%$ reduction in computation time, underscoring its potential for efficient phase optimization in RIS-aided cell-free mMIMO systems."}

At each FC antenna, there is one fixed-position active antenna and multiple passive couplers that can move within a designated region around the active antenna. Moreover, each FC antenna is equipped with a local processing unit (LPU). All LPUs exchange signals with a central processing unit (CPU) for joint signal processing. We study an FC-aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an FC array base station (BS) is deployed to enhance the downlink communication between the BS and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate optimization problems to maximize the achievable sum rate of users by jointly optimizing the coupler positions and digital beamforming, subject to movement constraints on the coupler positions and the transmit power constraint. To address the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, the digital beamforming is expressed as a function of the FC position vectors, which are then optimized using the proposed distributed coupler position optimization algorithm. Considering a structured time domain pattern of pilots and coupler positions, pilot-assisted centralized and distributed channel estimation algorithms are designed under the FC array architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed FC array achieves substantial rate gains over conventional benchmarks in multiuser systems without moving active antennas, and approaches the performance of fully active arrays while significantly reducing hardware cost and power consumption. Moreover, the proposed channel estimation algorithms outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of both pilot overhead and channel reconstruction accuracy."}

Remarkably, this is the same as the capacity of the channel in the NS-assisted non-causal CSIT setting, $C^{NS,nc}=\\max_{P_{X|S}}I(X;Y\\mid S)$, which was previously established, and also matches the (either classical or with NS assistance) capacity of the channel where the state is available not only (either causally or non-causally) to the transmitter but also to the receiver. While the capacity remains unchanged, the optimal probability of error for fixed message size and blocklength, in the NS-assisted causal CSIT setting can be further improved if channel state is made available to the receiver. This is in contrast to corresponding NS-assisted non-causal CSIT setting where it was previously noted that the optimal probability of error cannot be further improved by providing the state to the receiver."}

The key technical ingredient is the notion of multiple equal-difference (MED) representations of the defining set of a simple-root polynomial, which generalizes the MED representation of a cyclotomic coset. We prove that every MED representation induces an upper bound on the minimum distance; the classical Singleton bound corresponds to the coarsest representation, while the strongest among these bounds is defined as the arithmetic Singleton bound. It is shown that the arithmetic Singleton bound is always at least as tight as the Singleton bound, and a precise criterion for it to be strictly tighter is obtained. For irreducible constacyclic codes, the bound is given explicitly by $ω+1$, where $ω$ is a constant closely related to the order of $q$ modulo the radical of the polynomial order. This work provides the first systematic translation of arithmetic structure-via MED representations-into restrictive constraints on the minimum distance, revealing that the Singleton bound may be unattainable not because of linear limitations, but due to underlying algebraic obstructions."}

Unlike human-oriented communications, robot-oriented D2C communications in autonomous operations place greater emphasis on task completion rather than solely on data transmission. Such differences require us to evaluate the performance of each stage in the system and consider the integrated optimization. Motivated by this, we model the system in a sensing-communication-computing-control (SC3) closed-loop manner and analyze it from an entropy-based perspective, based on which a task-oriented system design method is developed. Furthermore, to manage the complexity of the closed-loop system, we decompose it into fine-grained functional structures and investigate the key challenges associated with collaborative sensing, collaborative computing, and collaborative control. A case study is presented to compare the proposed task-oriented scheme with conventional communication-oriented schemes, showing that the proposed method performs better in terms of task controlling.

In blind settings, however, their use becomes significantly less stable due to the inherent non-convexity of the problem and the potential non-identifiability of the solutions. (Linear) minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators provide a compelling alternative that can circumvent these limitations. In this work, we study synthetic two-dimensional blind deconvolution problems under fully controlled conditions, with complete prior knowledge of both the signal and kernel distributions. We compare tailored MAP algorithms with simple LMMSE estimators whose functional form is closely related to that of an optimal Tikhonov estimator. Our results show that, even in these highly controlled settings, MAP methods remain unstable and require extensive parameter tuning, whereas the LMMSE estimator yields a robust and reliable baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that the LMMSE solution can serve as an effective initialization for MAP approaches, improving their performance and reducing sensitivity to regularization parameters, thereby opening the door to future theoretical and practical developments."}

Closed-form CRB expressions are derived for two representative detection formulations, namely covariance-oriented and coherent models. Moreover, for single-antenna FASs, we obtain a closed-form coherent CRB by leveraging random matrix theory.

High-contrast settings, such as subsurface models with salt bodies, exhibit strong scattering and phase sensitivity that challenge existing neural operators. We propose a hybrid architecture that decomposes the scattering operator into two separate contributions: a smooth background propagation and a high-contrast scattering correction. The smooth component is learned with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which produces globally coupled feature tokens encoding background wave propagation; these tokens are then passed to a vision transformer, where attention is used to model the high-contrast scattering correction dominated by strong, spatial interactions. Evaluated on high-frequency Helmholtz problems with strong contrasts, the hybrid model achieves substantially improved phase and amplitude accuracy compared to standalone FNOs or transformers, with favorable accuracy-parameter scaling."}

It is typically quantified using the Age of Information (AoI) metric, which has been widely adopted to capture the freshness of information received in the form of status updates. While AoI-based metrics quantify how timely the collected information is, they largely overlook the environmental impact associated with frequent transmissions, specifically, the resulting Carbon Footprint (CF). To address this gap, we introduce a carbon-aware AoI framework. We first derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI under constrained CF budgets for the baseline $M/M/1$ and $M/M/1^*$ queuing models, assuming fixed Carbon Intensity (CI). We then extend the analysis by treating CI as a dynamic, time-varying parameter and solve the AoI minimization problem. Our results show that minimizing AoI does not inherently minimize CF, highlighting a clear trade-off between information freshness and environmental impact. CI variability further affects achievable AoI, indicating that sustainable operation requires joint optimization of CF budgets, Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), and transmission scheduling. This work lays the foundation for carbon-aware information freshness optimization in next-generation networks."}

In real-world driving environments, radar signals often undergo multipath propagation due to reflections from surfaces such as guardrails. These indirect paths can produce ghost targets - false detections that appear at incorrect locations - posing challenges to autonomous navigation. A recent method, the Multi-Path Iterative Adaptive Approach (MP-IAA), addresses this by jointly estimating the DOA/DOD angle grid, identifying mismatches as indicators of ghost targets. However, its effectiveness declines in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. To enhance robustness, we introduce a physics-inspired regularizer that captures structural patterns inherent to multipath propagation. This regularizer is incorporated into the estimation cost, forming a new loss function that guides our proposed algorithm, TIGRE (Target-Induced angle-Grid Regularized Estimation). TIGRE iteratively minimizes this regularized loss and we show that our proposed regularizer asymptotically enforces L0 sparsity on the DOA/DOD grid. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method substantially enhances the quality of angle-grid estimation across various multipath scenarios, particularly in low SNR environments, providing a more reliable basis for subsequent ghost target identification."}

To mitigate errors caused by sampling randomness, we derive transition probabilities and log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each constellation point and employ practical channel codes for error correction. We then extend this framework to substitution and insertion-deletion (ID) channels, proposing constellation update rules that account for these additional impairments.

This article examines how practical considerations regarding the phase tuning of unit cells impact the RIS performance. Specifically, we examine the radar cross-section (RCS) obtained from two RIS configurations: In the first, each atom of the RIS is tuned based on a theoretical analog phase shift to realize idealized one-beam patterns at the desired angles. In the second configuration, each atom of the RIS is tuned based on a low-complexity, one-bit quantized element phase shift, which results in dual symmetric beams.

Gossiping enables local information exchange in a decentralized manner without relying solely on the transmitter's direct communication, which we assume incurs a transmission cost. On the other hand, gossiping may be communicating stale information, necessitating the transmitter's intervention. With communication links having specific success probabilities, we formulate an average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) to jointly minimize the sum AoI and transmission cost for such a system in a time-slotted setting. We employ the Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm to evaluate the optimal policy for the transmitter and then prove several structural properties showing that it has an age-difference threshold structure with minimum age activation in the case where gossiping is relatively more reliable. Specifically, direct transmission is optimal only if the minimum AoI of the receivers is large enough and their age difference is below a certain threshold. Otherwise, the transmitter idles to effectively take advantage of gossiping and reduce direct transmission costs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the significance of our optimal policy compared to multiple baselines. Our result is a first step towards characterizing optimal freshness and transmission cost trade-offs in gossiping networks."}

The resulting design couples the multi-antenna base-station (BS) beamformer with combinatorial FRIS port selection and discrete phase assignment, leading to a highly nonconvex mixed discrete optimization. To address this challenge, we develop an alternating-optimization (AO) framework that alternates between a closed-form maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) update at the BS and an {optimal} FRIS-configuration update. The key step of the proposed FRIS configuration is a Minkowski-geometry reformulation of the FRIS codebook superposition: by convexifying the feasible reflected-sum set and exploiting support-function identities, we convert the FRIS subproblem into a one-dimensional maximization over a directional parameter. For each direction, the optimal configuration is obtained constructively via per-port directional scoring, Top-$M_o$ port selection, and optimal codeword assignment. For the practically important regular $M_p$-gon phase-shifter codebook, we further derive closed-form score expressions and establish a piecewise-smooth structure of the resulting support function, which leads to a finite critical-angle search that provably identifies the global optimum without exhaustive angular sweeping. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmarks, achieves near-optimal beamforming gains in exhaustive-search validations, accurately identifies the optimal direction via support-function maximization, and converges rapidly within a few AO iterations."}

In this article, a unified analytical framework is proposed to characterize the maintainability of PASS. Within this framework, random waveguide failures and repairs are modeled by treating the waveguide lifetime and repair time as exponentially distributed random variables, which are characterized by the failure rate and the repair rate, respectively. The operational state of the waveguide is described by a two-state continuous-time Markov chain, for which the transition probabilities and steady-state probabilities of the waveguide being working or failed are analyzed. By incorporating the randomness of the waveguide operational state into the transmission rate, system maintainability is characterized using the probability of non-zero rate (PNR) and outage probability (OP). The proposed framework is applied to both a conventional PASS employing a single long waveguide and a segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) composed of multiple short waveguide segments under two operational protocols: segment switching (SS) and segment aggregation (SA). Closed-form expressions for the PNR and OP are derived for both architectures, and the corresponding scaling laws are analyzed with respect to the service-region size and the number of segments. It is proven that both SS-based and SA-based SWAN achieve higher PNR and lower OP than conventional PASS, which confirms the maintainability advantage of segmentation. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the maintainability gain of SWAN over conventional PASS increases with the number of segments, and ii) SA provides stronger maintainability than SS."}

To ensure better explainability and generalization, EqDeepRx retains conventional channel estimation and augments it with a lightweight DenoiseNN that learns frequency-domain smoothing. To reduce the dimensionality of the DetectorNN inputs, the receiver utilizes two linear equalizers in parallel: a linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) equalizer with interference-plus-noise covariance estimation and a regularized zero-forcing (RZF) equalizer. The parallel equalized streams are jointly consumed by the DetectorNN, after which a compact DemapperNN produces bit log-likelihood ratios for channel decoding. 5G/6G-compliant end-to-end simulations across multiple channel scenarios, pilot patterns, and inter-cell interference conditions show improved error rate and spectral efficiency over a conventional baseline, while maintaining low-complexity inference and support for different MIMO configurations without retraining."}

The access points (APs) in each cluster serve mobile user equipments (UEs) by employing RSMA. The UEs employ successive interference cancellation to decode their data. This work emphasizes the role of downlink (DL) pilots in realizing RSMA benefits in practical CF systems with spatially-correlated Rician channels which observe random phase shifts, pilot contamination, and channel aging due to UE mobility. We numerically show that DL pilots are required for RSMA in user-centric CF mMIMO systems with channel aging to outperform spatial division multiple access. We show that the degraded channel quality due to higher UE velocity and longer resource block lengths significantly reduces the RSMA SE. Increasing the number of clusters can compensate for the SE loss."}

However, most assume perfect environment information, which is unrealistic in practice due to sensor limitations, mapping errors, and temporal changes. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks trained with task-specific perturbations of geometry, materials, and Tx positions can implicitly compensate for prediction errors caused by inaccurate environment inputs. When tested with noisy inputs on synthetic indoor scenarios, models trained with perturbed environment data reduce error by up to 25\\% compared to models trained on clean data. We verify our approach on real-world measurements, achieving 2.1 dB RMSE with noisy input data and 1.3 dB with complete information, compared to 2.3-3.1 dB for classical methods such as ray-tracing and radial basis function interpolation. Additionally, we compare different ways of encoding environment information at varying levels of detail and we find that, in the considered single-room indoor scenarios, binary occupancy encoding performs at least as well as detailed material property information, simplifying practical deployment."}

Flanagan"], "title": "Exploiting Structural Flexibility in SIM-Enabled Communications: From Adaptive Inter-Layer Spacing to Fully Morphable Layers", "comment": "Submitted to IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently emerged as a promising metasurface-based physical-layer paradigm for wireless communications, enabling wave-domain signal processing through multiple cascaded metasurface layers. However, conventional SIM designs rely on rigid planar layers with fixed interlayer spacing, which constrain the propagation geometry and can lead to performance saturation as the number of layers increases. This paper investigates the potential of introducing structural flexibility into SIM-enabled communication systems. Specifically, we consider two flexible SIM architectures: distance-adaptive SIM (DSIM), where interlayer distances are optimized, and stacked flexible intelligent metasurface (SFIM), where each metasurface layer is fully morphable. We jointly design the meta-atom positions and responses together with the transmit beamformer to maximize the system sum rate under per-user rate, quantization, morphing, and interlayer distance constraints. An alternating optimization framework combining gradient projection, penalty-based method, and successive convex approximation is developed to address the resulting non-convex problems. Perturbation analysis reveals that the flexibility gains of both DSIM and SFIM scale approximately linearly with the morphing range, with SFIM exhibiting a faster growth rate. Simulation results demonstrate that flexible SIM designs mitigate performance saturation with increasing layers and achieve significant transmit power savings compared to rigid SIMs."}

Katsaros", "Chathura Jayawardena", "Konstantinos Nikitopoulos"], "title": "ViPer NL-COMM: Making Vector Perturbation Precoding Practical", "comment": "Accepted for publication IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing", "summary": "Large MIMO systems rely on efficient downlink precoding to enhance data rates and improve connectivity through spatial multiplexing. However, currently employed linear precoding techniques, such as MMSE, significantly limit the achievable spectral efficiency. To meet practical error-rate targets, existing linear methods require an excessively high number of access point antennas relative to the number of supported users, leading to disproportionate increases in power consumption.Efficient non-linear processing frameworks for uplink MIMO transmissions, such as NL-COMM, have been proposed. However, downlink non-linear precoding methods, such as Vector Perturbation (VP), remain impractical for real-world deployment due to their exponentially increasing computational complexity with the number of supported streams. This work presents ViPer NL-COMM, the first practical algorithmic and implementation framework for VP-based precoding. ViPer NL-COMM extends the core principles of NL-COMM to the precoding problem, enabling scalable parallelization and real-time computational performance while maintaining the substantial spectral-efficiency benefits of VP precoding. ViPer NL-COMM consists of a novel mathematical framework and an FPGA prototype capable of supporting large MIMO configurations (up to 16x16), high-order modulation (256-QAM), and wide bandwidths (100 MHz) within practical power and resource budgets. System-level evaluations demonstrate that ViPer NL-COMM achieves target error rates using only half the number of transmit antennas required by linear precoding, yielding net power savings on the order of hundreds of Watts at the RF front end. Moreover, ViPer NL-COMM enables supporting more information streams than available AP antennas when the streams are of low-rate, paving the way for enhanced massive-connectivity scenarios in next-generation wireless networks."}

Rather than introducing new mathematical tools, the manuscript revisits foundational concepts-transfer functions, poles and zeros, impulse responses, and stability-from an operational perspective rooted in practical signal processing and circuit implementation. First-order systems are used as a minimal yet expressive framework to illustrate how integration, differentiation, filtering, and delay manifest across the Laplace and Z domains. Particular attention is given to causality, bandwidth limitations, sampling effects, and the approximation errors inherent in discrete-time representations. The goal is to bridge the gap between formal mathematical descriptions and the intuition required for reliable system design in mixed analog-digital environments."}

At each FC antenna, there is one fixed-position active antenna and multiple passive couplers that can move within a designated region around the active antenna. Moreover, each FC antenna is equipped with a local processing unit (LPU). All LPUs exchange signals with a central processing unit (CPU) for joint signal processing. We study an FC-aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an FC array base station (BS) is deployed to enhance the downlink communication between the BS and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate optimization problems to maximize the achievable sum rate of users by jointly optimizing the coupler positions and digital beamforming, subject to movement constraints on the coupler positions and the transmit power constraint. To address the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, the digital beamforming is expressed as a function of the FC position vectors, which are then optimized using the proposed distributed coupler position optimization algorithm. Considering a structured time domain pattern of pilots and coupler positions, pilot-assisted centralized and distributed channel estimation algorithms are designed under the FC array architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed FC array achieves substantial rate gains over conventional benchmarks in multiuser systems without moving active antennas, and approaches the performance of fully active arrays while significantly reducing hardware cost and power consumption. Moreover, the proposed channel estimation algorithms outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of both pilot overhead and channel reconstruction accuracy."}

Gossiping enables local information exchange in a decentralized manner without relying solely on the transmitter's direct communication, which we assume incurs a transmission cost. On the other hand, gossiping may be communicating stale information, necessitating the transmitter's intervention. With communication links having specific success probabilities, we formulate an average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) to jointly minimize the sum AoI and transmission cost for such a system in a time-slotted setting. We employ the Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm to evaluate the optimal policy for the transmitter and then prove several structural properties showing that it has an age-difference threshold structure with minimum age activation in the case where gossiping is relatively more reliable. Specifically, direct transmission is optimal only if the minimum AoI of the receivers is large enough and their age difference is below a certain threshold. Otherwise, the transmitter idles to effectively take advantage of gossiping and reduce direct transmission costs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the significance of our optimal policy compared to multiple baselines. Our result is a first step towards characterizing optimal freshness and transmission cost trade-offs in gossiping networks."}
