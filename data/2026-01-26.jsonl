A data processing pipeline is proposed to address the issue of missing data. Specifically, missing information is recovered through linear and exponential interpolation and extrapolation. Furthermore, imputation and proximity-based inference are employed. We represent tags as nodes in a temporal graph, with edges formed based on correlations between received signal strength (RSS) and phase values across successive timestamps, and we train a graph-based convolutional neural network that exploits graph-based self-attention. The system outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 98.13% for the recognition of 21 gestures. We achieve 89.28% accuracy under leave-one-person-out cross-validation. We further investigate the contribution of various body locations on the recognition accuracy. Removing tags from the arms reduces accuracy by more than 10%, while removing the wrist tag only reduces accuracy by around 2%. Therefore, tag placements on the arms are more expressive for gesture recognition than on the wrist."}

Considering a large set of gestures, distinct patterns are difficult to be captured by learning algorithms using backscattered received signal strength (RSS) and phase signals. This is because these features often exhibit similarities across signals from different gestures. To address this limitation, we explore the estimation of Angle of Arrival (AoA) as a distinguishing feature, since AoA characteristically varies during body motion. To ensure reliable estimation in our system, which employs Smart Antenna Switching (SAS), we first validate AoA estimation using the Multiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm while the tags are fixed at specific angles. Building on this, we propose an AoA tracking method based on Kalman smoothing. Our analysis demonstrates that, while RSS and phase alone are insufficient for distinguishing certain gesture data, AoA tracking can effectively differentiate them. To evaluate the effectiveness of AoA tracking, we implement gesture recognition system benchmarks and show that incorporating AoA features significantly boosts their performance. Improvements of up to 15% confirm the value of AoA-based enhancement."}

This technology is essential for realizing smart hearing aids that address the cocktail party problem and for facilitating objective audiometry systems. Existing AAD research mainly utilizes dichotic environments where different speech signals are presented to the left and right ears, enabling models to classify directional attention rather than speech content. However, this spatial reliance limits applicability to real-world scenarios, such as the \"cocktail party\" situation, where speakers overlap or move dynamically. To address this challenge, we propose an AAD framework for diotic environments where identical speech mixtures are presented to both ears, eliminating spatial cues. Our approach maps EEG and speech signals into a shared latent space using independent encoders. We extract speech features using wav2vec 2.0 and encode them with a 2-layer 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), while employing the BrainNetwork architecture for EEG encoding. The model identifies the attended speech by calculating the cosine similarity between EEG and speech representations. We evaluate our method on a diotic EEG dataset and achieve 72.70% accuracy, which is 22.58% higher than the state-of-the-art direction-based AAD method."}

Submitted to an IEEE journal for possible publication", "summary": "Cell-free networks leverage distributed access points (APs) to achieve macro-diversity, yet their performance is often constrained by large disparities in channel quality arising from user geometry and blockages. To address this, rotatable antennas (RAs) add a lightweight hardware degree of freedom by steering the antenna boresight toward dominant propagation directions to strengthen unfavorable links, thereby enabling the network to better exploit macro-diversity for higher and more uniform performance. This paper investigates an RA-enabled cell-free downlink network and formulates a max-min rate problem that jointly optimizes transmit beamforming and antenna orientations. To tackle this challenging problem, we develop an alternating-optimization-based algorithm that iteratively updates the beamformers via a second-order cone program (SOCP) and optimizes the antenna orientations using successive convex approximation. To reduce complexity, we further propose an efficient two-stage scheme that first designs orientations by maximizing a proportional-fair log-utility using manifold-aware Frank-Wolfe updates, and then computes the beamformers using an SOCP-based design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed orientation-aware designs achieve a substantially higher worst-user rate than conventional beamforming-only benchmarks. Furthermore, larger antenna directivity enhances fairness with proper orientation but can degrade the worst-user performance otherwise."}

This complexity, however, increases power consumption, making the systems energy-intensive. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent a novel generation of neural networks inspired by the highly efficient human brain. By emulating its event-driven and energy-efficient mechanisms, SNNs enable low-power, real-time signal processing. They differ from ANNs in two key ways: they exhibit inherent temporal dynamics and process and transmit information as short binary signals called spikes. Despite their promise, major challenges remain, e.g., identifying optimal learning rules and effective neural encoding. This thesis investigates the design of SNN-based receivers for nonlinear time-invariant frequency-selective channels. Backpropagation through time with surrogate gradients is identified as a promising update rule and the novel quantization encoding (QE) as promising neural encoding. Given the model of the intensity modulation with direct detection link, we compare two different receiver architectures based on equalization performance and spike count. Using decision feedback and QE achieves both strong performance and low spike counts. Notably, SNN-based receivers significantly outperform ANN-based counterparts. We furthermore introduce policy gradient-based update (PGU), an reinforcement learning-based update algorithm that requires no backpropagation. Using PGU, encoding parameters are optimized, drastically reducing runtime, complexity, and spikes per inference while maintaining performance. This thesis contributes a successful design and optimization framework for SNN-based receivers. By addressing key challenges in SNN optimization, it facilitates future advances in the design and deployment of energy-efficient SNN receivers."}

Moreover, compared to classical vector-based solutions, the proposed architecture decodes the navigation message in the loop, without the need to run scalar loops in parallel or having to store pre-downloaded ephemeris data. This architecture therefore does not increase the area occupied on the FPGA and does not use additional resources for storage. The proposed GNSS receiver architecture uses GPS L1/C and Galileo E1 signals and is composed of one acquisition module and 16 tracking channels (8 GPS and 8 Galileo) which are implemented within a FPGA (Zynq-Ultrascale)."}

Beyond accurate hard detection, reliable soft information is equally critical, as modern receivers rely on soft-input channel decoding, imposing additional requirements on the detector design. In this work, we propose recurSIC, a lightweight learning-based MIMO detection framework that is structurally inspired by successive interference cancellation (SIC) and incorporates learned processing stages. It generates reliable soft information via multi-path hypothesis tracking with a tunable complexity parameter while requiring only a single forward pass and a minimal parameter count.

However, practical implementations of DNA storage are constrained by errors introduced during synthesis, preservation, and sequencing processes, and traditional error-correcting codes remain vulnerable to noise levels that exceed predefined thresholds. Here, we developed a Partitioning-mapping with Jump-rotating (PJ) encoding scheme, which exhibits exceptional noise resilience. PJ removes cross-strand information dependencies so that strand loss manifests as localized gaps rather than catastrophic file failure. It prioritizes file decodability under arbitrary noise conditions and leverages AI-based inference to enable controllable recovery of digital information. For the intra-strand encoding, we develop a jump-rotating strategy that relaxes sequence constraints relative to conventional rotating codes and provides tunable information density via an adjustable jump length. Based on this encoding architecture, the original file information can always be decoded and recovered under any strand loss ratio, with fidelity degrading smoothly as damage increases. We demonstrate that original files can be effectively recovered even with 10% strand loss, and machine learning datasets stored under these conditions retain their classification performance. Experiments further confirmed that PJ successfully decodes image files after extreme environmental disturbance using accelerated aging and high-intensity X-ray irradiation. By eliminating reliance on prior error probabilities, PJ establishes a general framework for robust, archival DNA storage capable of withstanding the rigorous conditions of real-world preservation."}

For the important special case where the FS encoder is irreducible, we derive several equivalent forms of this inequality, which are based on well known formulas for spectral radius. It also turns out that in the irreducible case, Kraft sums are bounded by a constant, independent of the block length, and thus cannot grow even in any subexponential rate.

A key invariance in the busy phase collapses the dynamics onto a one-dimensional busy-start boundary, reducing preemption control to an optimal stopping problem. Building on this structure, we develop an efficient policy iteration algorithm with heavy-tail acceleration, employing a hybrid (uniform/log-spaced) action grid and a far-field linear closure. Simulations under Pareto and log-normal service times demonstrate substantial improvements over AoI-optimal non-preemptive sampling and zero-wait baselines, achieving up to a 30x reduction in average cost in heavy-tailed regimes. Finally, simulations uncover a counterintuitive insight: under preemption, delay variance, despite typically being a liability, can become a strategic advantage for information freshness."}

The proposed approach enables the determination of optimal parameters for any target distribution matcher rate. Specifically, lower bounds on energy loss, rate loss, and memory requirements are analytically estimated for HiDM architectures approximating the Maxwell Boltzmann (MB) distribution. A semi analytical optimization framework is employed to jointly optimize rate and energy loss, allowing the selection of the number of hierarchical layers, memory size, and block length required to optimize channel capacity. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated through probabilistic amplitude shaping of 16QAM (PAS 16QAM), showing good agreement between analytical predictions and simulated results. The proposed analytical tool facilitates the design of HiDM structures that are compatible with practical hardware and implementation constraints, such as those imposed by state-of-the-art application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Furthermore, the performance of the optimized HiDM structure, incorporating layer selection based on lower-bound energy loss, is evaluated over the AWGN channel in terms of normalized generalized mutual information (NGMI) as a function of the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). At a net data rate of 200 Gbps with 25% forward error correction (FEC) overhead, the proposed scheme achieves a shaping gain improvement of 2.8% compared to previously reported solutions."}

Leveraging the incidence relations between lines and ovals, we describe a class of non-systematic MDS matrices with a large number of small and disjoint recovery sets. For certain parameter choices, the service-rate region of these matrices contains the region of a systematic generator matrix for the same code, yielding better service performance. We further apply our construction to analyze the PIR properties of the considered MDS matrices and present a one-step majority-logic decoding algorithm with strong error-correcting capability. These results highlight how ovals, a classical object in finite geometry, re-emerge as a useful tool in modern coding theory."}

The fading severity is quantified in terms of Hyper-Rayleigh Regimes (HRRs) (i.e., full-HRR (worst-case conditions), strong-, weak-, and no-HRR), and the channel model used (Inverse Power Lomax (IPL)) was chosen since it can account for all HRRs. The research presents the derived closed-form channel coefficient envelope statistics for the single IRS-element channel with IPL statistics in both subchannels and total IRS-assisted channel, as well as tight approximations for the channel coefficient and instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) statistics for the latter. The derived expressions helped estimate channel parameters corresponding to the specific HRRs of the total channel and demonstrate that while both single links (i.e., ''source-IRS'' and ''IRS-destination'') are in full-HRR, the minimum number of IRS elements needed to bring the total IRS-assisted link (''source-IRS-destination'') out of full-HRR is no less than $6$ (for the whole range on the IPL scale parameter corresponding full-HRR). Furthermore, the minimum number of IRS elements required to bring the total IRS-assisted link into no-HRR is $14$ (under the same conditions)."}

We study compression rates of stable lossless source codes. Using combinatorial arguments, we derive information-theoretic limits on the achievable rate as a function of the stability parameters."}

We propose a load-balancing algorithm that minimizes the total network power consumption; including transmit power, fixed static power, and traffic-dependent fronthaul power at the access points (APs) without degrading system performance. To this end, we formulate a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem and introduce an iterative joint power allocation and AP load balancing (JPALB) algorithm. The algorithm aims to reduce total power usage while meeting both the communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of URLLC users and the sensing QoS needed for target detection. Proposed JPALB algorithm for ISAC systems was simulated with maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoders. Simulation results show approximately 33% reduction in power consumption, using JPALB algorithm compared to a baseline with no load balancing, without compromising communication and sensing QoS requirements."}

Traditional sector-search-based beam alignment algorithms rely on sequential sampling to identify the best sector, resulting in a significant latency burden on 6G communication systems. Recently proposed adaptive beam alignment algorithms based on the active learning framework address the problem, aiming to identify the optimal sector with the fewest possible samples under an identical sector partition. Nevertheless, these algorithms either lack feasibility (Chiu, Ronquillo and Javidi, JSAC 2019) due to ideal assumptions or lack interpretability (Sohrabi, Chen and Yu, JSAC 2021) due to the use of end-to-end black-box neural networks. To avoid ideal assumptions and maintain interpretability, we address all above problems by proposing an adaptive beam alignment algorithm using the framework of noisy twenty questions estimation with a trained questioner. Specifically, we use two methods for training the questioner to eliminate reliance on ideal assumptions. The first method maps queries of twenty questions estimation to beamforming vectors via weighted summation of steering vectors, as an initial attempt to address the feasibility problem encountered in prior pioneering study by Chiu, Ronquillo and Javidi (JSAC 2019). The second method uses multi-layer fully connected neural networks to achieve improved performance while only employing them to train the questioner, which can effectively mitigate the interpretability issues in prior study by Sohrabi, Chen and Yu (JSAC 2021). Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive beam alignment algorithms and demonstrate that our algorithms outperform all benchmark algorithms."}

Specifically, in twenty questions estimation, there are two players: an oracle and a questioner. The questioner aims to estimate target variables by posing queries to the oracle that knows the variables and using noisy responses to form reliable estimates. Typically, there are adaptive and non-adaptive query procedures. In adaptive querying, one designs the current query using previous queries and their noisy responses while in non-adaptive querying, all queries are posed simultaneously. Generally speaking, adaptive query procedures yield better performance. However, adaptive querying leads to privacy concerns, which were first studied by Tsitsiklis, Xu and Xu (COLT 2018) and by Xu, Xu and Yang (AISTATS 2021) for the noiseless case, where the oracle always provides correct answers to queries. In this paper, we generalize the above results to the more practical noisy case, by proposing a two-stage private query procedure, analyzing its non-asymptotic and second-order asymptotic achievable performance and discussing the impact of privacy concerns. Furthermore, when specialized to the noiseless case, our private query procedure achieves better performance than above-mentioned query procedures (COLT 2018, AISTATS 2021)."}

We focus on redaction (erasure) mechanisms, in which data are either withheld or released unchanged, and measure utility by the average cardinality of the released set, equivalently, the expected Hamming distortion. Assuming the data are generated by a finite time-homogeneous Markov chain, we study the protection of the initial state while maximizing the amount of shared data. We establish a connection between perfect privacy and window-based redaction schemes, showing that erasing data up to a strong stationary time preserves privacy under suitable conditions. We further study an optimal sequential redaction mechanism and prove that it admits an equivalent window interpretation. Interestingly, we show that both mechanisms achieve the optimal distortion while redacting only a constant average number of data points, independent of the data length~$N$."}

In this context, the growing interest in deploying machine learning on edge devices must be balanced against stringent constraints on computational complexity and memory while supporting high-order modulation. Beyond accurate hard detection, reliable soft information is equally critical, as modern receivers rely on soft-input channel decoding, imposing additional requirements on the detector design. In this work, we propose recurSIC, a lightweight learning-based MIMO detection framework that is structurally inspired by successive interference cancellation (SIC) and incorporates learned processing stages. It generates reliable soft information via multi-path hypothesis tracking with a tunable complexity parameter while requiring only a single forward pass and a minimal parameter count. Numerical results in realistic wireless scenarios show that recurSIC achieves strong hard- and soft-detection performance at very low complexity, making it well suited for edge-constrained MIMO receivers."}
