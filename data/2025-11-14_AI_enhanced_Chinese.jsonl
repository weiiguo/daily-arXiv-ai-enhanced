Through the discovery of significant spatial diversity within a compact antenna space, FASs enable the implementation of reconfigurable-antenna-based architectures. However, current state-of-the-art studies rarely investigate the impact of finite blocklength constraints on FAS-based designs, leaving a gap in both analytical modeling and the establishment of a solid, universally applicable performance metric for finite blocklength fluid antenna systems (FBL-FAS). In this work, we focus on the study of FBL-FAS and, more importantly, derive a block error rate (BLER) bound that serves as a general and practical performance benchmark across various FAS architectures. The proposed BLER bound is computable both with and without an explicit statistical model, meaning that the BLER performance can be characterized analytically or empirically under model-aware or model-free system scenarios. Moreover, when the statistical model is known, the analytical results derived from the proposed BLER bound exhibit strong alignment with the empirical findings, demonstrating the remarkable simplicity, accuracy, and universality of the proposed BLER bound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u5757\u957f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf(FBL-FAS)\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684BLER\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8be5\u754c\u9650\u53ef\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f88\u5c11\u63a2\u8ba8\u6709\u9650\u5757\u957f\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9FAS\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5757\u957f\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5757\u9519\u8bef\u7387(BLER)\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8be5\u754c\u9650\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5404\u79cdFAS\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u77e5\u65f6\uff0c\u4ece\u63d0\u51fa\u7684BLER\u754c\u9650\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684BLER\u754c\u9650\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aFBL-FAS\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy. The resulting combination of sample efficiency and interpretability establishes causal MBRL as a practical approach for resource-constrained wireless systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7f51\u7edc\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a8\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7f51\u7edc\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u83b7MAC\u63a7\u5236\u6d88\u606f\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u9ed1\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u679cMBRL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1158%\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56e0\u679c\u5f52\u56e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679cMBRL\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Adjustable phase shift pilots (APSPs) are an effective technique to acquire channels with low overhead by exploiting channel sparsity. In this paper, we extend it to multiple groups and propose multi-group adjustable phase shift pilots (MAPSPs) to improve SE further. We first introduce a massive MIMO-OFDM system model and transform the conventional channel model in the space-frequency domain to the angle-delay domain, obtaining a sparse channel matrix. Then, we propose a method of generating MAPSPs through multiple basic sequences and investigate channel estimation processes. By analyzing the components of pilot interference, we elucidate the underlying mechanism by which interference affects MMSE estimation. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate the benefit of phase scheduling in MAPSP channel estimation and establish the optimal design condition tailored for scheduling. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on Zadoff-Chu sequences that includes received signal pre-processing and pilot scheduling methods to mitigate pilot interference.

This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization.

Code and datasets: https://github.com/LS-Wireless/ASSENT-CellFree-ISAC", "summary": "Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key emerging 6G technology. Despite progress, ISAC still lacks scalable methods for joint AP clustering and user/target scheduling in distributed deployments under fronthaul limits. Moreover, existing ISAC solutions largely rely on centralized processing and full channel state information, limiting scalability. This paper addresses joint access point (AP) clustering, user and target scheduling, and AP mode selection in distributed cell-free ISAC systems operating with constrained fronthaul capacity. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly captures interference coupling, RF-chain limits, and sensing requirements, providing optimal but computationally demanding solutions. To enable real-time and scalable operation, we propose ASSENT (ASSociation and ENTity selection), a graph neural network (GNN) framework trained on MILP solutions to efficiently learn association and mode-selection policies directly from lightweight link statistics. Simulations show that ASSENT achieves near-optimal utility while accurately learning the underlying associations. Additionally, its single forward pass inference reduces decision latency compared to optimization-based methods.

To unleash the full potential of rotatable IRSs for wireless communications, this paper investigates the joint optimization of IRS rotation angles to maximize the minimum expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all locations within a given target area. We first propose an angle-dependent channel model that accurately characterizes the reception and reflection of each IRS element. Different from the conventional cosine-law assumption, the proposed model captures the practical electromagnetic characteristics of the IRS, including the effective reception area and reflection efficiency. For the single target location case, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is developed to solve the SNR maximization problem, and a closed-form expression for a near-optimal solution is derived to provide useful insights. For the general area coverage enhancement case, the optimal rotation is obtained through a two-loop PSO-based iterative algorithm with null-point detection. In this algorithm, the outer loop updates the global rotation angles to maximize the minimum SNR over the target area, whereas the inner loop evaluates the SNR distribution within the area to identify the location corresponding to the minimum SNR through null-point detection.

Modern analytical placers formulate the placement problem as a nonlinear optimization, where initialization strongly affects both convergence behavior and final placement quality. However, existing initialization methods exhibit a trade-off: area-aware initializers account for cell areas but are computationally expensive and can dominate total runtime, while fast point-based initializers ignore cell area, leading to a modeling gap that impairs convergence and solution quality. We propose a lightweight co-optimization framework that bridges this initialization gap through two strategies. First, an area-hint refinement initializer incorporates heuristic cell area information into a signed graph signal by augmenting the netlist graph with virtual nodes and negative-weight edges, yielding an area-aware and spectrally smooth placement initialization. Second, a macro-schedule placement procedure progressively restores area constraints, enabling a smooth transition from the refined initializer to the full area-aware objective and producing high-quality placement results. We evaluate the framework on macro-heavy ISPD2005 academic benchmarks and two real-world industrial designs across two technology nodes (12 cases in total). Experimental results show that our method consistently improves half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) over point-based initializers in 11 out of 12 cases, achieving up to 2.2% HPWL reduction, while running approximately 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art area-aware initializer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9762\u79ef\u63d0\u793a\u7cbe\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u5b8f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5e03\u5c40\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728VLSI\u5168\u5c40\u5e03\u5c40\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u9762\u79ef\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5668\u8003\u8651\u5355\u5143\u9762\u79ef\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u800c\u5feb\u901f\u70b9\u57fa\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5668\u5ffd\u7565\u5355\u5143\u9762\u79ef\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5efa\u6a21\u5dee\u8ddd\u5f71\u54cd\u6536\u655b\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "1. \u9762\u79ef\u63d0\u793a\u7cbe\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5668\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8d1f\u6743\u91cd\u8fb9\u5c06\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5355\u5143\u9762\u79ef\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\uff1b2. \u5b8f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5e03\u5c40\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1a\u9010\u6b65\u6062\u590d\u9762\u79ef\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7cbe\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5668\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u9762\u79ef\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c11\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7684HPWL\u6bd4\u70b9\u57fa\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5668\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u51cf\u5c112.2%\u7684HPWL\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5668\u5feb\u7ea6100\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e03\u5c40\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Shared semantic memories between transmitter and receiver can potentially enable bandwidth savings by reusing previously transmitted concepts as context to reconstruct data, but require effective mechanisms to determine when current content is similar enough to stored patterns. However, existing hard quantization approaches based on variational autoencoders are limited by frequent memory updates even under small changes in data dynamics, which leads to inefficient usage of bandwidth.To address this challenge, in this paper, a memory-augmented semantic communication framework is proposed where both transmitter and receiver maintain a shared memory of semantic concepts using modern Hopfield networks (MHNs). The proposed framework employs soft attention-based retrieval that smoothly adjusts stored semantic prototype weights as data evolves that enables stable matching decisions under gradual data dynamics. A joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and memory retrieval\n  mechanism is performed with the objective of maximizing a reasoning capacity metric that quantifies semantic efficiency as the product of memory reuse rate and compression ratio. Theoretical analysis establishes the fundamental rate-distortion-reuse tradeoff and proves that soft retrieval reduces unnecessary transmissions compared to hard quantization under bounded semantic drift. Extensive simulations over diverse video scenarios demonstrate that the proposed MHN-based approach achieves substantial bit reductions around 14% on average and up to 70% in scenarios with gradual content changes compared to baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3Hop\u573a\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8bed\u4e49\u539f\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4f20\u8f93\u6bd4\u7279\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u5408\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u786c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3Hop\u573a\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u6ed1\u8c03\u6574\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u539f\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u8f6f\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u6bd4\u786c\u91cf\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea614%\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u5728\u6e10\u8fdb\u5185\u5bb9\u53d8\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1170%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3Hop\u573a\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u8282\u7701\u3002"}}

This paper presents an empirical evaluation of collaborative self-calibration for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) networks, extending a discrete Bayesian approach based on grid-based uncertainty propagation. The enhanced algorithm reduces measurement availability requirements while maintaining positioning accuracy through probabilistic state estimation. We validate the approach using real-world data from controlled indoor UWB network experiments with 12 nodes in a static environment. Experimental evaluation demonstrates 0.28~m mean ranging error under line-of-sight conditions and 1.11~m overall ranging error across mixed propagation scenarios, achieving sub-meter positioning accuracy. Results demonstrate the algorithm's robustness to measurement noise and partial connectivity scenarios typical in industrial deployments. The findings contribute to automated UWB network initialization for indoor positioning applications, reducing infrastructure dependency compared to manual anchor calibration procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u81ea\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u683c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6d4b\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u89c6\u8ddd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8ddd\u8bef\u5dee0.28\u7c73\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u573a\u666f\u4e0b1.11\u7c73\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e9a\u7c73\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u81ea\u6821\u51c6\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0UWB\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u589e\u5f3a\u534f\u4f5c\u81ea\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u5728\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7f\u752812\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u771f\u5b9eUWB\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u89c6\u8ddd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8ddd\u8bef\u5dee0.28\u7c73\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u4f20\u64ad\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u603b\u4f53\u6d4b\u8ddd\u8bef\u5dee1.11\u7c73\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e9a\u7c73\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u8fde\u63a5\u573a\u666f\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684UWB\u7f51\u7edc\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u624b\u52a8\u951a\u70b9\u6821\u51c6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}
