However, the adoption of these technologies fundamentally changes the characteristics of wavefronts, forcing communication systems to operate in the near-field region. The transition from planar far-field communications to spherical near-field propagation necessitates novel channel estimation algorithms to fully exploit the unique features of spherical wavefronts for advanced transceiver design. To this end, we propose a novel semi-gridless channel estimation approach based on a variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework. Specifically, we reformulate the near-field channel model for both uniform linear arrays and uniform planar arrays into separate direction-of-arrival (DoAs) and distance components. Building on these new representations, we employ a gridless approach for DoAs estimation using a von Mises distribution, and a coarse-to-fine grid search for distance estimation. We then develop a semi-gridless variational Bayesian (SG-VB) algorithm with efficient update rules that enables accurate channel reconstruction. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SG-VB algorithm, demonstrating enhanced near-field channel reconstruction accuracy and superior estimation performance for both DoAs and distance components embedded in near-field channels."}

However, the same devices have not been used for delay-synchronous channel sounding due to challenges related to the stability of synchronization and lack of reference power levels. Due to factors such as uncertainty in symbol reception timing, impulse responses are discontinuous across acquisitions. The present paper addresses the challenges to perform delay-synchronous channel sounding using off-the-shelf multiple-antenna IEEE 802.11ax WiFi devices, referred to as SoundiFi. Stable delay synchronization and power level reference are realized by remoting the antennas with coaxial cables and devoting one of the antennas as a reference channel, with which the gain and delay of other simultaneous channels are defined. Indoor experiments confirmed that the impulse response becomes continuous across successive acquisitions and provide the absolute delay. The impulse response has a noise level at -115 dB, indicating the maximum path gain value that can be measured with the devices. The impulse response also revealed the existence of long-delayed multipaths up to 132 m propagation distance in a reverberant 30-m-long corridor."}

Specifically, three MA schemes are considered to facilitate the multicast transmission: i) treating interference as noise (TIN), ii) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and iii) time-division multiple access (TDMA) with two PA reconfiguration protocols, namely pinching switching (PS) and pinching multiplexing (PM). i) For TIN, a closed-form solution is derived for optimal power allocation, while a sequential element-wise optimization (SEO) is developed for the PA placement. ii) For NOMA, a recursive power allocation framework incorporating a bisection search is developed, and a hierarchical objective evaluation (HOE) mechanism is incorporated to simplify the SEO process for PA location update. iii) For TDMA, the PS protocol allows the PA locations to be optimized separately using the SEO method, after which the time-power allocation is solved as a convex problem with a global optimum. Under the PM protocol, the PA locations are jointly optimized with the time-power resources through a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based analytical solution. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the pinching-antenna system (PASS) architecture significantly outperforms traditional fixed-antenna systems. ii) TDMA-PS achieves superior performance by fully leveraging the flexible PA reconfiguration and benefiting from interference-free transmission, whereas TIN serves as a practical lower-bound solution due to its simplicity despite its limited performance. iii) NOMA consistently outperforms TDMA-PM and, in high transmit power regimes with heterogeneous multicast group distributions, can even surpass the performance achieved by TDMA-PS."}

However, superimposed pilots (SIP), which reduce overhead, introduce severe pilot contamination and data interference, complicating joint channel estimation and data detection. This paper proposes a conditional flow matching receiver (CFM-Rx), an unsupervised generative framework that learns directly from received signals, eliminating the need for labeled data and improving adaptability across diverse system settings. By leveraging flow-based generative modeling, CFM-Rx enables deterministic, low-latency inference and exploits model invertibility to capture the bidirectional nature of signal propagation. This framework unifies flow matching with score-based diffusion modeling via a moment-consistent ordinary differential equation (ODE), replacing stochastic differential equation (SDE) sampling with a deterministic and efficient process. Furthermore, it integrates receiver-side priors to ensure stable, data-consistent inference. Extensive simulation results across various MIMO configurations demonstrate that CFM-Rx consistently outperforms conventional estimators and state-of-the-art data-driven receivers, achieving notable gains in channel estimation accuracy and symbol detection robustness, particularly under severe pilot contamination."}

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Millimeter-wave massive multiple-input multiple-output systems employ highly directional beamforming to overcome severe path loss, and their performance critically depends on accurate beam alignment. Conventional codebook-based methods offer low training overhead but suffer from limited angular resolution and sensitivity to hardware impairments. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning-enhanced super-resolution beam alignment framework with three key components. First, we design the Quaternary Search-based Super-Resolution (QSSR) algorithm, which leverages the monotonic power ratio property between two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook beams to achieve super-resolution angle estimation without increasing measurement complexity relative to binary search. Second, we develop QSSR-Net, a gated recurrent unit-based neural network that exploits sequential multi-layer beam measurements to capture angular dependencies, thereby improving estimation accuracy, robustness to noise, and generalization across diverse propagation environments. Third, to mitigate the adverse effects of hardware impairments such as antenna position and phase errors, we propose a parametric self-calibration method that requires no additional hardware overhead and adapts compensation parameters in real time. Simulation results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms binary search and even exhaustive search at high signal-to-noise ratios, achieving substantial performance gains while maintaining low overhead."}

In traditional wireless systems, signals propagate through the air, where they are vulnerable to interference, attenuation, and jamming. Guided communication, in contrast, confines signals within a physical medium, significantly reducing interference and supporting higher data rates over longer distances. Guided wireless technology harnesses these benefits by creating guided wireless channels and offering a controlled pathway for electromagnetic waves. This work harnesses these benefits by focusing on the modeling of near-field communication through long connected arrays deployed in linear-cell environments. We derive a circuit model for long array as an infinitely long dipole with multiple periodic feed points before approximating it with a finite array through open circuiting. Through our simulations, we show how the standing wave phenomenon is confirmed by the oscillations in spectral efficiency. We also demonstrate the capability of the LMMSE transmit beamformer in mitigating interference and minimizing the mean square error by adaptively allocating more power to the user experiencing the most severe channel attenuation, resulting in a more balanced variation of achievable rates across users."}

In the proposed system, indoor LED access points are used to simultaneously provide illumination and transmit information over light to a backscatter device (BD), which harvests optical energy and backscatters the received messages to user equipments (UEs) equipped with radio frequency (RF) front ends. This forwarding of the information from VLC to RF channels is implemented without the need for carrier synthesizers and power amplifiers at the IoT node. By modeling the end-to-end communication link with short-packet IoT traffic and realistic levels of interference between adjacent VLC coverage areas, we analyze the outage performance and achievable data rate of the proposed system. Simulation results demonstrate that key factors, such as placement and orientation of the BD, as well as the selected code rate of the system affect reliability and data rate that can be achieved for communication purposes. The insights gained from this study pave the way for ambient power-enabled IoT solutions and future hybrid VLC/RF network designs."}

However, severe path loss, blockage effects, and sensitivity to beam misalignment pose major challenges to reliable indoor THz communications. In this paper, we investigate the coverage probability of downlink transmission in a three-dimensional (3D) indoor THz communication system under structured access point (AP) deployments, with a focus on square and hexagonal grid topologies. A tractable analytical framework is developed to jointly account for human blockages, correlated wall blockages across APs, beam training, and residual pointing error. Numerical results demonstrate that wall blockage correlation significantly reduces the association and coverage probabilities, and its impact cannot be neglected in system performance analysis. Compared with square grid AP deployments, hexagonal grids consistently achieve higher coverage by mitigating correlated wall blockage effects and reducing the distances between user equipments (UEs) and their associated APs. Furthermore, coverage performance is shown to strongly depend on the UE location, with noticeable degradation as the UE moves away from its nearest AP. Residual pointing error is found to introduce substantial coverage loss, especially for longer links. In addition, beam training analysis reveals a non-monotonic relationship between antenna array size and training overhead, highlighting an inherent tradeoff among antenna configuration, beamwidth selection, and beam training efficiency. These findings provide useful insights into the design and deployment of practical indoor THz communication systems."}

The heterogeneity in delay constraints and UE mobility introduces resource allocation conflicts and imbalances, which undermine communication reliability and challenge NA. Although unified resource allocation (URA) can mitigate these issues, it remains unclear whether NA can be sustained under such diverse conditions. To address this, we derive expressions for the lower bound (LB) on NA in AHetNets under URA. Our analysis reveals that extended heterogeneity significantly degrades the LB due to resource limitations-even when the heterogeneity stems from additional services under less stringent delay constraints (LSDC) or from UEs with lower mobility. To overcome this degradation, we formulate and solve a joint optimization problem for the number of UEs sharing time-frequency resources ($K$) and pilot length ($ξ$), aiming to enhance the LB by improving spatial, frequency, and temporal resource efficiency. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that jointly optimizing $K$ and $ξ$ enables AHetNets to achieve the target NA under greater heterogeneity, outperforming existing resource allocation policies."}

Under the assumption of a large uniform linear array (ULA) size at the receiver, the multipath components are separated directly in the angular domain. It is then shown that the proposed superimposed pilot scheme enables the computation of integrated delay and Doppler profiles by averaging the received delay-Doppler matrix across the Doppler and delay axes, respectively. This procedure helps reduce data-to-pilot interference through data averaging. Moreover, it is demonstrated that fractional delays and Dopplers of the multipath components can be estimated by correlating the integrated delay and Doppler profiles with the corresponding delay/Doppler terms. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing OTFS superimposed pilot schemes, achieving a lower bit error rate (BER) while exhibiting a trade-off between peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and communication performance."}

This property, termed perfect c-nonlinearity (PcN), represents optimal resistance to c-differential attacks - a concern highlighted by recent cryptanalysis of the Kuznyechik cipher variant. We provide the first characterization using the classical difference distribution table (DDT): F is PcN if and only if Delta_F(a,b) Delta_F(a,c^{-1}b) = 0 for all nonzero a,b. This enables verification in O(p^{2n}) time given a precomputed DDT, a significant improvement over the naive O(p^{3n}) approach. We prove a strict dichotomy for monomial permutations: the derivative F(x + alpha) - cF(x) is either a permutation for all nonzero shifts or for none, with the general case remaining open. For quadratic permutations, we provide explicit algebraic characterizations. We identify the first class of affine transformations preserving c-differential uniformity and derive tight nonlinearity bounds revealing fundamental incompatibility between PcN and APN properties. These results position perfect c-nonlinearity as a structurally distinct regime within permutation polynomial theory."}

This paper investigates an LCX based generalized pinching-antenna system with dual-port feeding. By enabling bidirectional excitation along each cable, the proposed design significantly enhances spatial degrees of freedom. A comprehensive channel model is developed to characterize intra-cable attenuation, bidirectional phase progression, slot based radiation, and wireless propagation. Based on this model, both analog and hybrid beamforming frameworks are studied with the objective of maximizing the minimum achievable data rate. For analog transmission, slot activation, port selection, and power allocation are jointly optimized using matching theory, coalitional games, and bisection based power control. For hybrid transmission, zero-forcing (ZF) digital precoding is incorporated to eliminate inter-user interference, thereby simplifying slot activation and enabling closed-form optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that dual-port feeding provides notable performance gains over single-port LCX systems and fixed-antenna benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming and resource allocation designs under various transmit power levels and cable parameters."}
