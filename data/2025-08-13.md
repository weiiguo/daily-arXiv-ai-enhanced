### [1] [Achievable Rates of Nanopore-based DNA Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08567)
*Brendon McBain,Emanuele Viterbo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于纳米孔的DNA存储的可实现速率，使用不依赖碱基识别算法的可处理通道模型解码纳米孔信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺乏包含纳米孔信号的DNA存储数据集的问题，并评估纳米孔通道模型的性能。

Method: 提出简化的消息传递算法，用于高效软解码纳米孔信号，并基于动态时间规整（DTW）算法推导可实现速率。

Result: 在公开数据集上，解码100个碱基长度的DNA链，可实现0.64-1.18比特/碱基的速率，平均为0.96比特/碱基。

Conclusion: 该方法为纳米孔DNA存储提供了可行的解码方案，但速率仍较保守，未考虑特定纳米孔的校准。

Abstract: This paper studies achievable rates of nanopore-based DNA storage when
nanopore signals are decoded using a tractable channel model that does not rely
on a basecalling algorithm. Specifically, the noisy nanopore channel (NNC) with
the Scrappie pore model generates average output levels via i.i.d. geometric
sample duplications corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian noise (NNC-Scrappie).
Simplified message passing algorithms are derived for efficient soft decoding
of nanopore signals using NNC-Scrappie. Previously, evaluation of this channel
model was limited by the lack of DNA storage datasets with nanopore signals
included. This is solved by deriving an achievable rate based on the dynamic
time-warping (DTW) algorithm that can be applied to genomic sequencing datasets
subject to constraints that make the resulting rate applicable to DNA storage.
Using a publicly-available dataset from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), it
is demonstrated that coding over multiple DNA strands of $100$ bases in length
and decoding with the NNC-Scrappie decoder can achieve rates of at least
$0.64-1.18$ bits per base, depending on the channel quality of the nanopore
that is chosen in the sequencing device per channel-use, and $0.96$ bits per
base on average assuming uniformly chosen nanopores. These rates are
pessimistic since they only apply to single reads and do not include
calibration of the pore model to specific nanopores.

### [2] [Optimum 1-Step Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Reed-Muller Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08736)
*Hoang Ly,Emina Soljanin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的硬判决解码器，能够在单步内完成解码，达到错误纠正极限，并证明其在擦除设置中的最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多数逻辑解码器需要多步处理，且性能受限。本文旨在设计一种单步解码器，适用于所有参数，并实现最优错误纠正和擦除恢复。

Method: 提出了一种新的硬判决解码器，通过并行实现Reed的原始算法，同时解码所有消息符号。

Result: 该解码器在单步内达到最多d_min/4的错误纠正能力，并在擦除设置中恢复最多d_min-1的符号。

Conclusion: 这是首个同时实现最优擦除纠正和最大单步错误纠正能力的RM码解码器。

Abstract: The classical majority-logic decoder proposed by Reed for Reed-Muller codes
RM(r, m) of order r and length 2^m, unfolds in r+1 sequential steps, decoding
message symbols from highest to lowest degree. Several follow-up decoding
algorithms reduced the number of steps, but for a limited set of parameters, or
at the expense of reduced performance, or relying on the existence of some
combinatorial structures. We show that any one-step majority-logic decoder-that
is, a decoder performing all majority votes in one step simultaneously without
sequential processing-can correct at most d_min/4 errors for all values of r
and m, where d_min denotes the code's minimum distance. We then introduce a new
hard-decision decoder that completes the decoding in a single step and attains
this error-correction limit. It applies to all r and m, and can be viewed as a
parallel realization of Reed's original algorithm, decoding all message symbols
simultaneously. Remarkably, we also prove that the decoder is optimum in the
erasure setting: it recovers the message from any erasure pattern of up to
d_min-1 symbols-the theoretical limit. To our knowledge, this is the first
1-step decoder for RM codes that achieves both optimal erasure correction and
the maximum one-step error correction capability.

### [3] [Optimized Arithmetic Coding for Efficient Data Compression in the Resource-Constrained Internet of Things(IoT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08840)
*Vatsala Upadhyay,J. Kokila,Abhishek Vaish*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种优化的算术编码方法，适用于物联网环境，通过减少计算冗余、降低维度和分组概率，显著提升了压缩效率和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网环境中大量异构数据的存储和传输面临挑战，传统算术编码计算复杂且资源消耗高。

Method: 结合迭代优化、主成分分析（PCA）和基数减少技术，优化算术编码算法。

Result: 优化算法在图像数据集上表现优异，压缩比达814:1，单图压缩时间101毫秒，显著降低CPU和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 优化算法适合实时应用和资源受限环境，有效提升数据传输和存储效率。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) generates vast amounts of heterogeneous data,
ranging from sensor readings to log alerts and images, that pose challenges to
storage and data transmission in resource-constrained environments. In this
context, lossless data compression techniques, like Arithmetic Coding, offer an
effective solution owing to their high compression ratio. However, the standard
Arithmetic Coding technique is computationally intensive, leading to high
memory and processing overhead. This paper proposes an optimized version of
Arithmetic coding for the IoT environment that incorporates three improvements
using Iterative and Iteration Optimizations for minimizing redundant
computations and achieving faster convergence; Principal Component
Analysis(PCA) for dimensionality reduction and identifying key features; and
lastly, Cardinality reduction for grouping similar probabilities to improve the
compression efficiency. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of
images and demonstrated significant reductions in the time to compress, CPU
utilization, and memory consumption, and preserves data integrity as seen
through the low RMSE values. The optimized version of the Arithmetic Coding
algorithm achieves an impressive compression ratio of 814:1 and 101 ms to
compress a single image. This makes the optimized algorithm suitable for
real-time applications and resource-constrained environments for efficient data
transmission and storage.

### [4] [A Dual Framework for Optimized Data Storage and Retrieval using Lightweight Python Blockchain and Scalable Smart Contracts with IPFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08887)
*Vatsala Upadhyay,J. Kokila,Abhishek Vaish*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效、安全的双向数据存储与检索框架，结合IPFS和区块链技术，显著提升了数据上传速度，适用于实时和关键IoT应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统云模型存在延迟、安全和高成本问题，现有IPFS-区块链方案计算效率低且成本高。

Method: 开发了动态监控设备数据并迁移至IPFS的框架，记录CID到区块链，通过智能合约实现实时访问；进一步优化为轻量级Python框架。

Result: 数据上传时间从117.12秒（现有方案）降至7.63秒（优化前）和4.2秒（优化后），分别提升93.47%和45%。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、安全，适合实时IoT应用，优于现有IPFS-智能合约方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of IoT data demands efficient, secure, and scalable
storage solutions on one hand, and efficient data migration and retrieval on
the other hand are essential for the systems to be practical and acceptable for
different applications. The traditional cloud-based models face latency,
security, and high operational costs, while existing bi-directional data
storage and retrieval-based IPFS models are not computationally efficient and
incur high gas costs at the cost of a necessary blockchain deployment. To
overcome the challenges of efficient data migration, we initially developed a
2-way data storage and retrieval system as well as a scalable framework that
dynamically monitors and transfers device-generated data to IPFS, records the
content identifier(CID) on a blockchain, and enables secure, real-time access
via smart contracts. Experimental results demonstrate that the existing work
achieved an average data upload time of 117.12 sec for a file size of 500 MB;
our framework achieves a faster upload time of 7.63 sec, marking a 93.47%
improvement. We further optimize the proposed framework to reduce the file
upload time incurred from the smart contracts by introducing a
blockchain-inspired, lightweight, and customizable Python framework that
replicates the storage and retrieval functionalities of a traditional
blockchain, where the file upload time is 4.2 sec, further optimized by 45%
from our previous approach, thus demonstrating its efficiency, security and
suitability for deploy ment in real-time and critical IoT applications and
outperforming the existing IPFS-smart contract based solutions.

### [5] [Generalized Bicycle Codes with Low Connectivity: Minimum Distance Bounds and Hook Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09082)
*Reza Dastbasteh,Olatz Sanz Larrarte,Arun John Moncy,Pedro M. Crespo,Josu Etxezarreta Martinez,Ruben M. Otxoa*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了广义自行车（GB）码的最小距离的新上下界，并应用于分析两类高度退化的GB码族，展示了其逻辑操作和容错性，最后通过数值模拟评估了其逻辑错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GB码的最小距离及其在量子纠错中的应用，特别是针对高度退化的码族，以探索其与表面码的相似性和性能。

Method: 通过上下界分析GB码的最小距离，构造两类码族并分析其逻辑操作，设计症状提取模式，并使用BP-OSD和MWPM解码器进行数值模拟。

Result: 发现两类GB码族的最小距离分别为$d$（奇数和偶数），展示了逻辑CNOT门的容错实现，逻辑错误率阈值约为14-16%，与旋转表面码相近。

Conclusion: GB码在最小距离和容错性方面表现出色，逻辑错误率与表面码相当，展示了其在量子纠错中的潜力。

Abstract: We present new upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance of certain
generalized bicycle (GB) codes beyond the reach of techniques for classical
codes capable of even capturing the true minimum distance for some cases. These
bounds are then applied to illustrate the existence and analyze two highly
degenerate GB code families with parameters $[[d^2+1,2,d]]$ for odd $d \geq 3$
and $[[d^2,2,d]]$ for even $d \geq 4$, both having the property that each check
qubit is connected to exactly four data qubits similar to surface codes. For
the odd-distance family, we analyze the structure of low-weight logical Pauli
operators and demonstrate the existence of a fault-tolerant logical CNOT gate
between the two logical qubits, achievable through a simple relabeling of data
qubits. We further construct a syndrome extraction pattern for both families
that does not imply minimum distance reduction arising from extraction circuit
faults that propagate from the check qubits to the data qubits. Finally, we
numerically evaluate their logical error rates under a code capacity
depolarizing noise model using the belief propagation ordered statistics
decoding (BP-OSD) and minimum-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoders, yielding
thresholds of approximately $14-16\%$ for the odd and even families, very
similar to those of rotated surface codes.

### [6] [Where is the Boundary: Multimodal Sensor Fusion Test Bench for Tissue Boundary Delineation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08257)
*Zacharias Chen,Alexa Cristelle Cahilig,Sarah Dias,Prithu Kolar,Ravi Prakash,Patrick J. Codd*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于神经外科手术的多模态传感测试台，通过视觉、接触式麦克风和力传感器的融合，显著提高了组织分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人辅助神经外科手术缺乏自然感官反馈，尤其是在区分健康组织和肿瘤组织时。现有研究对多模态传感的探索有限。

Method: 开发了一个模块化测试台，结合视觉引导、接触式麦克风和力传感器数据，通过交互式图形界面实现实时数据采集和可视化。

Result: 实验结果表明，多模态融合显著提高了材料分类的准确性。

Conclusion: 该平台为手术中的传感器融合提供了可扩展的硬件-软件解决方案，展示了多模态方法在实时组织边界划分中的潜力。

Abstract: Robot-assisted neurological surgery is receiving growing interest due to the
improved dexterity, precision, and control of surgical tools, which results in
better patient outcomes. However, such systems often limit surgeons' natural
sensory feedback, which is crucial in identifying tissues -- particularly in
oncological procedures where distinguishing between healthy and tumorous tissue
is vital. While imaging and force sensing have addressed the lack of sensory
feedback, limited research has explored multimodal sensing options for accurate
tissue boundary delineation. We present a user-friendly, modular test bench
designed to evaluate and integrate complementary multimodal sensors for tissue
identification. Our proposed system first uses vision-based guidance to
estimate boundary locations with visual cues, which are then refined using data
acquired by contact microphones and a force sensor. Real-time data acquisition
and visualization are supported via an interactive graphical interface.
Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal fusion significantly improves
material classification accuracy. The platform provides a scalable
hardware-software solution for exploring sensor fusion in surgical applications
and demonstrates the potential of multimodal approaches in real-time tissue
boundary delineation.

### [7] [Hardware-friendly IR-HARQ for Polar SCL Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08425)
*Marwan Jalaleddine,Jiajie Li,Warren J. Gross*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的极坐标码IR-HARQ方案，通过将集合操作转换为二进制向量操作，并优化快速节点集成，以减少硬件实现中的内存开销和面积开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了扩展极坐标码在下一代无线通信系统中的应用，需要支持IR-HARQ方案，但现有方案的集合操作和快速节点增加导致硬件实现效率低下和面积开销大。

Method: 将集合操作转换为二进制向量操作，并引入新的快速节点集成方法以避免增加快速节点数量。

Result: 提出的方案在内存开销上比不支持IR-HARQ的SCL解码增加了25-27%。

Conclusion: 通过优化操作和节点集成，显著提升了极坐标码IR-HARQ方案的硬件兼容性和效率。

Abstract: To extend the applications of polar codes within next-generation wireless
communication systems, it is essential to incorporate support for Incremental
Redundancy (IR) Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes. The baseline
IR-HARQ scheme's reliance on set-based operations leads to irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
implementation. Furthermore, the introduction of new bit types increases the
number of fast nodes that are decoded without traversing the sub-tree,
resulting in a substantial area overhead when implemented in hardware. To
address these issues and improve hardware compatibility, we propose
transforming the set-based operations within the polar IR-HARQ scheme into
binary vector operations. Additionally, we introduce a new fast node
integration approach that avoids increasing the number of fast nodes, thereby
minimizing the associated area overhead. Our proposed scheme results in a
memory overhead of 25-27% compared to successive cancellation list (SCL)
decoding without IR-HARQ support.

### [8] [Improved SINR Approximation for Downlink SDMA-based Networks with Outdated Channel State Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09020)
*Maria Cecilia Fernández Montefiore,Gustavo González,F. Javier López-Martínez,Fernando Gregorio*

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在下一代无线网络中，不完美CSIT下的MU-MIMO系统性能分析是一个关键挑战，需要准确的SINR统计建模。

Method: 提出了一种改进的SINR统计近似模型，保留了现有方法的分析简洁性，同时解决了低估SINR方差的问题。

Result: 在RSMA-MIMO系统中验证了模型的准确性，适用于不同用户数、天线数和CSIT过时程度。

Conclusion: 该模型为不完美CSIT下的MU-MIMO系统性能分析提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the performance of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT) remains a critical challenge in next-generation wireless networks. In
this context, accurate statistical modeling of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is essential for enabling
tractable performance analysis of multi-user systems. This paper presents an
improved statistical approximation of the SINR for downlink (DL) MU-MIMO
systems with imperfect CSIT. The proposed model retains the analytical
simplicity of existing approaches (e.g., Gamma-based approximations) while
overcoming their limitations, particularly the underestimation of SINR
variance. We evaluate the proposed approximation in the context of
Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-enabled MIMO DL systems with outdated
CSIT. The results demonstrate excellent accuracy across a wide range of system
configurations, including varying numbers of users, antennas, and degrees of
CSIT staleness.

### [9] [Tensor-Structured Bayesian Channel Prediction for Upper Mid-Band XL-MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08491)
*Hongwei Hou,Yafei Wang,Xinping Yi,Wenjin Wang,Dirk T. M. Slock,Shi Jin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的信道预测方法，结合了专用信道建模、概率表示和贝叶斯推断算法，以解决XL-MIMO系统中由信道老化和近场传播特性带来的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XL-MIMO系统在移动性下因信道老化和近场传播特性（如空间非平稳性）导致性能显著下降，需要一种高效的信道预测方法。

Method: 开发了基于张量结构的信道模型（SFT和BDD域），利用多符号的时域相关性进行预测，并采用均匀采样和扰动参数优化计算效率。

Result: 提出的TS-BLI算法通过张量操作和双因子图降低了计算复杂度，仿真显示其在信道预测性能上表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了XL-MIMO系统中的信道预测问题，为未来蜂窝系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The upper mid-band balances coverage and capacity for the future cellular
systems and also embraces XL-MIMO systems, offering enhanced spectral and
energy efficiency. However, these benefits are significantly degraded under
mobility due to channel aging, and further exacerbated by the unique near-field
(NF) and spatial non-stationarity (SnS) propagation in such systems. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel channel prediction approach that
incorporates dedicated channel modeling, probabilistic representations, and
Bayesian inference algorithms for this emerging scenario. Specifically, we
develop tensor-structured channel models in both the spatial-frequency-temporal
(SFT) and beam-delay-Doppler (BDD) domains, which leverage temporal
correlations among multiple pilot symbols for channel prediction. The factor
matrices of multi-linear transformations are parameterized by BDD domain grids
and SnS factors, where beam domain grids are jointly determined by angles and
slopes under spatial-chirp based NF representations. To enable tractable
inference, we replace environment-dependent BDD domain grids with uniformly
sampled ones, and introduce perturbation parameters in each domain to mitigate
grid mismatch. We further propose a hybrid beam domain strategy that integrates
angle-only sampling with slope hyperparameterization to avoid the computational
burden of explicit slope sampling. Based on the probabilistic models, we
develop tensor-structured bi-layer inference (TS-BLI) algorithm under the
expectation-maximization (EM) framework, which reduces computational complexity
via tensor operations by leveraging the bi-layer factor graph for approximate
E-step inference and an alternating strategy with closed-form updates in the
M-step. Numerical simulations based on the near-practical channel simulator
demonstrate the superior channel prediction performance of the proposed
algorithm.

Conclusion: D-MUBF在频率同步误差下性能受限，但理论分析与实验结果一致，公开数据集有助于进一步研究。

Abstract: Realizing distributed multi-user beamforming (D-MUBF) in time division duplex
(TDD)-based multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems faces significant challenges. One
of the most fundamental challenges is achieving accurate over-the-air (OTA)
timing and frequency synchronization among distributed access points (APs),
particularly due to residual frequency offsets caused by local oscillator (LO)
drifts. Despite decades of research on synchronization for MU-MIMO, there are
only a few experimental studies that evaluate D-MUBF techniques under imperfect
frequency synchronization among distributed antennas. This paper presents an
analytical and experimental assessment of D-MUBF methods in the presence of
frequency synchronization errors. We provide closed-form expressions for
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a function of channel
characteristics and statistical properties of carrier frequency offset (CFO)
among AP antennas. In addition, through experimental evaluations conducted with
the RENEW massive MIMO testbed, we collected comprehensive datasets across
various experimental scenarios. These datasets comprise uplink pilot samples
for channel and CFO estimation, in addition to uplink multi-user data intended
for analyzing D-MUBF techniques. By examining these datasets, we assess the
performance of D-MUBF in the presence of CFO and compare the analytical
predictions with empirical measurements. Furthermore, we make the datasets
publicly available and provide insights on utilizing them for future research
endeavors.

### [11] [Learning Zero Constellations for Binary MOCZ in Fading Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08571)
*Anthony Joseph Perre,Parker Huggins,Alphan Sahin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种设计零星座的方法，用于二进制调制的共轭倒数零点（BMOCZ）。第一种方法将星座设计视为多标签分类问题，学习零点的位置；第二种方法引入基于神经网络的解码器，联合学习解码器和零点参数。结果表明，神经网络解码器能直接推广到平坦衰落信道，且性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在性能上有显著提升，尤其是神经网络解码器，但需权衡计算复杂度。

Abstract: In this work, we propose two methods to design zero constellations for binary
modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (BMOCZ). In the first approach, we
treat constellation design as a multi-label binary classification problem and
learn the zero locations for a direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoder. In the
second approach, we introduce a neural network (NN)-based decoder and jointly
learn the decoder and zero constellation parameters. We show that the NN-based
decoder can directly generalize to flat-fading channels, despite being trained
under additive white Gaussian noise. Furthermore, the results of numerical
simulations demonstrate that learned zero constellations outperform the
canonical, Huffman BMOCZ constellation, with the proposed NN-based decoder
achieving large performance gain at the expense of increased computational
complexity.

Abstract: Biomedical signal processing extract meaningful information from
physiological signals like electrocardiograms (ECGs), electroencephalograms
(EEGs), and electromyograms (EMGs) to diagnose, monitor, and treat medical
conditions and diseases such as seizures, cardiomyopathy, and neuromuscular
disorders, respectively. Traditional manual physician analysis of electrical
recordings is prone to human error as subtle anomolies may not be detected.
Recently, advanced deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy of
biomedical signal analysis. A multi-modal deep learning model is proposed that
utilizes discrete wavelet transforms for signal pre-processing to reduce noise.
A multi-modal image fusion and multimodal feature fusion framework is utilized
that converts numeric biomedical signals into 2D and 3D images for image
processing using Gramian angular fields, recurrency plots, and Markov
transition fields. In this paper, deep learning models are applied to ECG, EEG,
and human activity signals using actual medical datasets, brain, and heart
recordings. The results demonstrate that using a multi-modal approach using
wavelet transforms improves the accuracy of disease and disorder
classification.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of communication technologies has driven the evolution
of communication networks towards both high-dimensional resource utilization
and multifunctional integration. This evolving complexity poses significant
challenges in designing communication networks to satisfy the growing
quality-of-service and time sensitivity of mobile applications in dynamic
environments. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as fundamental deep
learning (DL) models for complex communication networks. GNNs not only augment
the extraction of features over network topologies but also enhance scalability
and facilitate distributed computation. However, most existing GNNs follow a
traditional passive learning framework, which may fail to meet the needs of
increasingly diverse wireless systems. This survey proposes the employment of
agentic artificial intelligence (AI) to organize and integrate GNNs, enabling
scenario- and task-aware implementation towards edge general intelligence. To
comprehend the full capability of GNNs, we holistically review recent
applications of GNNs in wireless communications and networking. Specifically,
we focus on the alignment between graph representations and network topologies,
and between neural architectures and wireless tasks. We first provide an
overview of GNNs based on prominent neural architectures, followed by the
concept of agentic GNNs. Then, we summarize and compare GNN applications for
conventional systems and emerging technologies, including physical, MAC, and
network layer designs, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC),
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and cell-free network architecture. We
further propose a large language model (LLM) framework as an intelligent
question-answering agent, leveraging this survey as a local knowledge base to
enable GNN-related responses tailored to wireless communication research.

Conclusion: PD-ZALMS是一种高效且准确的近场XL-MIMO信道估计方法。

Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems
operating at sub-THz carrier frequencies represent a promising solution to meet
the demands of next-generation wireless applications. This work focuses on
sparse channel estimation for XL-MIMO systems operating in the near-field (NF)
regime. Assuming a practical subarray-based architecture, we develop a NF
channel estimation framework based on adaptive filtering, referred to as
\textit{polar-domain zero-attracting least mean squares (PD-ZALMS)}. The
proposed method achieves significantly superior channel estimation accuracy and
lower computational complexity compared with the well-established polar-domain
orthogonal matching pursuit. In addition, the proposed PD-ZALMS is shown to
outperform the oracle least-squares channel estimator at low-to-moderate
signal-to-noise ratio.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) significantly reduces redundant data and
improves transmission efficiency by extracting the latent features of
information. However, most of the conventional deep learning-based SemCom
systems focus on analog transmission and lack in compatibility with practical
digital communications. This paper proposes a vector quantized-variational
autoencoder (VQ-VAE) based digital SemCom system that directly transmits the
semantic features and incorporates the importance-aware orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission to enhance the SemCom performance,
where the VQ-VAE generates a discrete codebook shared between the transmitter
and receiver. At transmitter, the latent semantic features are firstly
extracted by VQ-VAE, and then the shared codebook is adopted to match these
features, which are subsequently transformed into a discrete version to adapt
the digital transmission. To protect the semantic information, an
importance-aware OFDM transmission strategy is proposed to allocate the key
features near the OFDM reference signals, where the feature importance is
derived from the gradient-based method. At the receiver, the features are
rematched with the shared codebook to further correct errors. Finally,
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the
conventional DeepSC and achieves better reconstruction performance under low
SNR region.

*Mateen Ashraf,Shahab Jahanbazi,Onel L. A. López*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文探讨了能量感知（EA）和能量盲（EB）任务决策方法在能量收集（EH）物联网设备中的性能比较，指出能量测量成本可能抵消其潜在优势，并提出了优化测量/任务执行频率的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究能量感知任务执行行为对能量收集物联网设备性能的影响，尤其是能量测量成本对潜在优势的抵消作用。

Method: 比较能量盲（EB）和能量感知（EA）任务决策方法，分析能量测量频率和任务执行频率对任务完成率的影响。

Result: 发现存在最优的能量测量/任务执行频率，可最大化任务完成率；若参数选择不当，EA调度可能表现不如EB调度。

Conclusion: 优化能量测量和任务执行频率对提升EH-IoT设备性能至关重要，需谨慎选择参数以避免性能下降。

Abstract: Energy-awareness for adapting task execution behavior can bring several
benefits in terms of performance improvement in energy harvesting (EH) Internet
of Things (IoT) devices. However, the energy measurement cost of acquiring
energy information, which is traditionally ignored, can potentially neutralize
or even reverse the potential benefits. This paper highlights operational
parameters, such as energy measurement frequency and task execution frequency,
which can be tuned to improve the task execution performance of an EH-IoT
device. To this end, we consider energy-blind (EB) and energy-aware (EA) task
decision approaches and compare their task completion rate performance. We show
that, for specific hardware design parameters of an EH-IoT device, there exists
an optimal energy measurement/task execution frequency that can maximize the
task completion rate in both approaches. Moreover, if these parameters are not
chosen appropriately, then energy measurement costs can cause EA scheduling to
underperform compared to EB scheduling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种患者自适应的聚焦发射方案，显著减少高质量超声图像所需的发射次数，通过后验采样和主动感知优化成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚焦发射波束形成帧率低，快速成像方法存在运动去相关和谐波成像限制。

Method: 采用后验采样和时域扩散模型，基于部分观测感知和解剖结构，主动选择信息量最大的发射。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上优于随机和等距子采样，对比噪声比更高，仅需2%发射即可估计射血分数。

Conclusion: 该方法实时性强，适用于GPU加速，代码公开。

Abstract: Focused transmit beamforming is the most commonly used acquisition scheme for
echocardiograms, but suffers from relatively low frame rates, and in 3D, even
lower volume rates. Fast imaging based on unfocused transmits has disadvantages
such as motion decorrelation and limited harmonic imaging capabilities. This
work introduces a patient-adaptive focused transmit scheme that has the ability
to drastically reduce the number of transmits needed to produce a high-quality
ultrasound image. The method relies on posterior sampling with a temporal
diffusion model to perceive and reconstruct the anatomy based on partial
observations, while subsequently taking an action to acquire the most
informative transmits. This active perception modality outperforms random and
equispaced subsampling on the 2D EchoNet-Dynamic dataset and a 3D Philips
dataset, where we actively select focused elevation planes. Furthermore, we
show it achieves better performance in terms of generalized contrast-to-noise
ratio when compared to the same number of diverging waves transmits on three
in-house echocardiograms. Additionally, we can estimate ejection fraction using
only 2% of the total transmits and show that the method is robust to outlier
patients. Finally, our method can be run in real-time on GPU accelerators from
2023. The code is publicly available at https://tue-bmd.github.io/ulsa/

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReQuestNet的新型神经网络架构，用于5G及更高版本的信道估计，解决了传统线性MMSE方法的局限性，并通过联合处理MIMO层和未知预编码的信道显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信系统中存在多种实际挑战，如可变资源块数量、动态传输层数等，传统线性MMSE方法在这些场景下表现不佳，因此需要一种更灵活、高效的解决方案。

Method: ReQuestNet由CoarseNet和RefinementNet两个子单元组成，前者进行粗略信道估计，后者通过利用跨预编码PRG和MIMO空间维度的相关性进行细化。

Result: 仿真结果显示，ReQuestNet在多种信道条件下显著优于传统MMSE方法，最高可提升10dB性能，并能有效泛化到未见过的信道配置。

Conclusion: ReQuestNet通过统一模型简化了信道估计流程，并在性能和泛化能力上表现出色，为5G及更高版本的通信系统提供了高效的信道估计解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for channel estimation
(CE) in 5G and beyond, the Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network
(ReQuestNet). It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless
communication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource
block (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups
(PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a
single unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides
it addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for
example, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by
jointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown
precoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet
followed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive
(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet
channel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded
PRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel
spatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet
significantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a
wide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB
gain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen
channel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations
under dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动偏置控制模块中的抖动信号会影响接收器性能，传统方法需修改物理层结构，本方法旨在避免此类修改。

Method: 利用KK关系进行初始信号决策，并重建抖动信号引起的失真。

Result: 实验显示，算法将抖动幅度容忍度提升至10% Vπ，80公里光纤传输中接收灵敏度提高1 dB以上。

Conclusion: 该失真消除方法有效提升了接收器性能。

Abstract: We propose an iterative distortion cancellation algorithm to digitally
mitigate the impact of double-sideband dither signal amplitude from the
automatic bias control module on Kramers-Kronig receivers without modifying
physical layer structures. The algorithm utilizes the KK relation for initial
signal decisions and reconstructs the distortion caused by dither signals.
Experimental tests in back-to-back showed it improved tolerance to dither
amplitudes up to 10% V{\pi}. For 80-km fiber transmission, the algorithm
increased the receiver sensitivity by more than 1 dB, confirming the
effectiveness of the proposed distortion cancellation method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TABS的新方法，通过预定义轨迹自适应调整波束形状，减少实时波束管理的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波和太赫兹频段的高频通信虽然能提升数据吞吐量，但路径损耗和波束对准问题严重，传统方法计算和信令开销大。

Method: TABS利用自加速光束技术，将电磁波前沿预定义轨迹调整，无需实时波束重构。

Result: 仿真表明TABS在链路性能、开销降低和实现复杂度方面表现优越。

Conclusion: TABS为高频移动通信提供了一种高效且低开销的解决方案。

Abstract: The quest for higher wireless carrier frequencies spanning the
millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) bands heralds substantial
enhancements in data throughput and spectral efficiency for next-generation
wireless networks. However, these gains come at the cost of severe path loss
and a heightened risk of beam misalignment due to user mobility, especially
pronounced in near-field communication. Traditional solutions rely on extremely
directional beamforming and frequent beam updates via beam management, but such
techniques impose formidable computational and signaling overhead. In response,
we propose a novel approach termed trajectory-adaptive beam shaping (TABS) that
eliminates the need for real-time beam management by shaping the
electromagnetic wavefront to follow the user's predefined trajectory. Drawing
inspiration from self-accelerating beams in optics, TABS concentrates energy
along pre-defined curved paths corresponding to the user's motion without
requiring real-time beam reconfiguration. We further introduce a dedicated
quantitative metric to characterize performance under the TABS framework.
Comprehensive simulations substantiate the superiority of TABS in terms of link
performance, overhead reduction, and implementation complexity.

Motivation: 研究近场多用户通信中RIS技术的灵活性和性能权衡问题，提出一种新的天线架构以支持独立配置的设计。

Method: 提出AT-RIS架构，分析对角和非对角T-RIS实现，结合聚焦、最小均方误差和特征模式分解等预编码方案。

Result: 非对角方案在用户少且角度分离度高时性能最优，但对角方案在高用户密度下表现更公平和可扩展。

Conclusion: 对角AT-RIS架构是近场多用户系统的实用解决方案，平衡了频谱效率、复杂性和公平性。

Abstract: This paper investigates a modular beamforming framework for reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user (MU) communications in the
near-field regime, built upon a novel antenna architecture integrating an
active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) array with a transmissive RIS (T-RIS),
referred to as AT-RIS. This decoupling enables coordinated yet independently
configurable designs in the AMAF and T-RIS domains, supporting flexible
strategies with diverse complexity-performance trade-offs. Several
implementations are analyzed, including diagonal and non-diagonal T-RIS
architectures, paired with precoding schemes based on focusing, minimum mean
square error, and eigenmode decomposition. Simulation results demonstrate that
while non-diagonal schemes maximize sum rate in scenarios with a limited number
of User Equipments (UEs) and high angular separability, they exhibit fairness
and scalability limitations as UE density increases. Conversely, diagonal T-RIS
configurations, particularly the proposed focusing-based scheme with uniform
feeder-side power allocation, offer robust, fair, and scalable performance with
minimal channel state information. The findings emphasize the critical impact
of UEs' angular separability and reveal inherent trade-offs among spectral
efficiency, complexity, and fairness, positioning diagonal AT-RIS architectures
as practical solutions for scalable near-field MU multiple-input single-output
systems.

semi-supervised channel charting in constructing a spatially consistent chart
of the considered extended urban environment. The considered method results in
$\approx$ 4.5 m localization error for the static DNT and $\approx$ 6 m in the
dynamic DNT, fostering DNT-aided channel charting and localization.

### [24] [Spectral Efficiency Considerations for 6G](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09117)
*Joseph Boccuzzi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的系统指标——无线电资源利用效率（RUE），用于量化未来6G需求中无线电资源的利用效率，并通过比较典型蜂窝和无小区大规模MIMO部署展示了其必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无线连接向6G发展，需要更高吞吐量、更低延迟和更高可靠性，同时要求更高的效率。现有指标如频谱效率（SE）和能量效率（EE）不足以全面衡量资源利用效率。

Method: 引入RUE指标，分析5G无线电资源、实际限制（如信道矩阵秩不足）和实施损耗（SINR下降）对SE的影响，并通过5G MU-MIMO实测数据验证。

Result: 5G的RUE为47%，显示6G有显著改进空间。增加传输带宽（从100MHz到1.6GHz）和采用下一代RAN架构可支持6G和AI-RAN。

Conclusion: RUE是衡量6G资源利用效率的重要指标，未来可通过优化算法和架构提升性能。

Abstract: As wireless connectivity continues to evolve towards 6G, there is an
ever-increasing demand to not only deliver higher throughput, lower latency,
and improved reliability, but also do so as efficiently as possible. To this
point, the term efficiency has been quantified through applications to Spectral
Efficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE). In this paper we introduce a new
system metric called Radio Resource Utilization Efficiency (RUE). This metric
quantifies the efficiency of the available radio resources (Spectrum, Access
Method, Time Slots, Data Symbols, etc.) used to deliver future 6G demands. We
compare the system performance of Typical Cellular and Cell-Free Massive MIMO
deployments as a vehicle to demonstrate the need for this new metric. We begin
by providing a concise treatment of items impacting SE by introducing three
categories: 5G Radio Resources, Practical Limitations (such as channel matrix
rank deficiency) and Implementation Losses (SINR degradation). For the example
Radio Access Technology configuration analyzed, we show 5G yields an RUE of 47%
(revealing significant room for improvement when defining 6G). Practical
limitation assumptions are compared to 5G Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO)
measurements conducted in a commercialized deployment. SE losses are
characterized to offer guidance to advanced algorithms employing Machine
Learning (ML) based techniques. We present the benefits of increasing the
transmission Bandwidth (BW) from 100MHz to 1.6GHz. We describe a Next
Generation RAN architecture that can support 6G and AI-RAN.
