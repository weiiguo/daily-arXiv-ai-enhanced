  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIMO优化方法在FAS中因计算复杂性和非凸性而难以适用，而深度学习方法的泛化能力有限。LLM因其通用适应性和推理能力成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种LLM驱动的FAS设计框架，结合端口选择和预编码器设计，并探讨了LLM在FAS多用户场景中的应用。

Conclusion: LLM为FAS设计提供了新的可能性，有望推动下一代无线网络的发展。

Abstract: The Fluid Antenna System (FAS), which enables flexible Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications, introduces new spatial degrees of freedom for next-generation wireless networks. Unlike traditional MIMO, FAS involves joint port selection and precoder design, a combinatorial NP-hard optimization problem. Moreover, fully leveraging FAS requires acquiring Channel State Information (CSI) across its ports, a challenge exacerbated by the system's near-continuous reconfigurability. These factors make traditional system design methods impractical for FAS due to nonconvexity and prohibitive computational complexity. While deep learning (DL)-based approaches have been proposed for MIMO optimization, their limited generalization and fitting capabilities render them suboptimal for FAS. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) extend DL's capabilities by offering general-purpose adaptability, reasoning, and few-shot learning, thereby overcoming the limitations of task-specific, data-intensive models. This article presents a vision for LLM-driven FAS design, proposing a novel flexible communication framework. To demonstrate the potential, we examine LLM-enhanced FAS in multiuser scenarios, showcasing how LLMs can revolutionize FAS optimization.

### [2] [Capacity Characterization of Pinching-Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14298)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了多用户捏合天线系统（PASS）的容量区域，分析了单捏合和多捏合情况下的容量特性，并证明了PASS优于传统固定天线系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定天线系统的信道容量受限，而PASS通过动态调整天线位置提升容量，研究其多用户场景下的性能具有重要意义。

Method: 1) 单捏合情况下推导了最优天线激活位置和容量区域的闭式解；2) 多捏合情况下使用交替优化和柯西不等式推导容量区域的内外边界；3) 通过上下行对偶框架扩展到下行链路。

Conclusion: PASS通过动态天线位置优化显著提升多用户通信性能，为未来无线系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unlike conventional systems using a fixed-location antenna, the channel capacity of the pinching-antenna system (PASS) is determined by the activated positions of pinching antennas. This article characterizes the capacity region of multiuser PASS, where a single pinched waveguide is deployed to enable both uplink and downlink communications. The capacity region of the uplink channel is first characterized. \romannumeral1) For the single-pinch case, closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal antenna activation position, along with the corresponding capacity region and the achievable data rate regions under time-division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). It is proven that the capacity region of PASS encompasses that of conventional fixed-antenna systems, and that the FDMA rate region contains the TDMA rate region. \romannumeral2) For the multiple-pinch case, inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived using an element-wise alternating antenna position optimization technique and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, respectively. The achievable FDMA rate region is also derived using the same optimization framework, while the TDMA rate region is obtained through an antenna position refinement approach. The analysis is then extended to the downlink PASS using the uplink-downlink duality framework. It is proven that the relationships among the downlink capacity and rate regions are consistent with those in the uplink case. Numerical results demonstrate that: \romannumeral1) the derived bounds closely approximate the exact capacity region, \romannumeral2) PASS yields a significantly enlarged capacity region compared to conventional fixed-antenna systems, and \romannumeral3) in the multiple-pinch case, TDMA and FDMA are capable of approaching the channel capacity limit.

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables information exchange at the nano- and microscale, with applications in areas like drug delivery and health monitoring. These event-driven scenarios often require alternatives to traditional transmission. Identification communication, introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck, offers such an approach, in which the receiver only determines whether a specific message was sent, suiting resource-limited and event-triggered systems. This paper combines MC with identification and proposes a one-dimensional (1D) diffusion-based model. Diffusion noise is modeled as a Poisson process, and a lower bound on channel capacity is derived. Simulations, microscopic, and with short-length deterministic codes, validate theoretical results, including the channel impulse response and error bounds. The findings support the design of practical MC systems, with potential use in testbed development.

This characterization confirms the absence of strong converse for this setting in both the reliability and covertness parameters. The crux of our approach is to analyze a codebook of BPSK-modulated codewords carefully augmented with "all-zero" codewords.

Abstract: We consider fronthaul-limited generalized zeroforcing-based cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems with multiple-antenna users and multipleantenna access points (APs) relying on both cooperative beamforming (CB) and user-centric (UC) clustering. The proposed framework is very general and can be degenerated into different special cases, such as pure CB/pure UC clustering, or fully centralized CB/fully distributed beamforming. We comprehensively analyze the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the system wherein the users use the minimum mean-squared errorbased successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) scheme to detect the desired signals. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the user association and power control for maximizing the sum SE. The formulated problem is under per-AP transmit power and fronthaul constraints, and is based on only long-term channel state information (CSI). The challenging formulated problem is transformed into tractable form and a novel algorithm is proposed to solve it using minorization maximization (MM) technique. We analyze the trade-offs provided by the CF-mMIMO system with different number of CB clusters, hence highlighting the importance of the appropriate choice of CB design for different system setups. Numerical results show that for the centralized CB, the proposed power optimization provides nearly 59% improvement in the average sum SE over the heuristic approach, and 312% improvement, when the distributed beamforming is employed.

### [6] [Joint Error Correction and Fading Channel Estimation Enhancement Leveraging GRAND](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14756)
*Charles Wiame,Ken R. Duffy,Muriel Médard*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于GRAND解码器的新方法，用于纠正存在信道估计误差时的错误，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信道估计误差（CEE）会导致显著的性能损失，传统方法通过增加导频序列长度或改进估计算法，但本文提出更高效的方法。

Method: 1. 测试多个信道估计候选值，并行计算LLR，通过ORBGRAND确定最可能码字；2. 改进方法，考虑剩余CEE对LLR的影响。

Result: 在[128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar和CRC码下，相比忽略CEE的情况，BLER性能提升数dB。

Conclusion: 新方法通过GRAND解码器有效应对CEE，显著提升无线通信性能。

Abstract: We present a novel method for error correction in the presence of fading channel estimation errors (CEE). When such errors are significant, considerable performance losses can be observed if the wireless transceiver is not adapted. Instead of refining the estimate by increasing the pilot sequence length or improving the estimation algorithm, we propose two new approaches based on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) decoders. The first method involves testing multiple candidates for the channel estimate located in the complex neighborhood around the original pilot-based estimate. All these candidates are employed in parallel to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR). These LLRs are used as soft input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). Posterior likelihood formulas associated with ORBGRAND are then computed to determine which channel candidate leads to the most probable codeword. The second method is a refined version of the first approach accounting for the presence of residual CEE in the LLR computation. The performance of these two techniques is evaluated for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes. For the considered settings, block error rate (BLER) gains of several dBs are observed compared to cases where CEE is ignored.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了高速无人机FPV系统中的通信问题，提出了一种基于实时几何调谐的圆形极化螺旋天线阵列解决方案，显著降低了包错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速无人机在复杂环境中飞行时，多普勒频移和多径效应会导致通信链路的高误包率，亟需一种可靠的解决方案。

Method: 结合Maxwell方程的全波仿真（Ansys HFSS）和盲场试验，提出了一种自适应螺旋天线阵列，实时调整线圈间距和直径以适应飞行参数变化。

Result: 与传统固定天线相比，自适应螺旋天线阵列在无人机速度超过150 mph时，误包率降低了20-30%，且VSWR接近1，RSSI变化减少一半。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，可重构硬件（如机械可调螺旋天线）能有效应对多普勒和多径效应，为无人机天线阵列设计提供了新思路，并为AI集成的自适应射频系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial FPV systems demand ultra-low latency, high-reliability communication links. At high speeds and in cluttered environments, Doppler shifts and rapid multipath changes can dramatically raise packet error rates. This paper investigates these phenomena in the context of ExpressLRS (ELRS) long-range FPV control links and demonstrates a novel solution: real-time geometry tuning of a circularly polarized helical antenna array. This study integrates Maxwell-equation-based full-wave simulations (via Ansys HFSS) with controlled, blind field trials to validate performance. A new analysis framework incorporates Doppler-induced frequency offset into the antenna's radiation pattern and the system's error model. Compared to a conventional fixed antenna, the adaptive helical array shows a 20-30% PER reduction when drones exceed 150 mph. The adaptive system automatically adjusts coil pitch and diameter to retune the antenna as flight parameters (velocity, attitude) change. Measured VSWR stays near unity, preventing transmitter reflection spikes. RSSI variation is reduced by half, indicating stronger link stability in urban multi-path. A regression analysis confirms that the reduction in PER due to tuning is highly statistically significant. Calibration data and error analyses are provided to validate our methodology. These findings advance the understanding of high-mobility UAV communication channels and demonstrate that reconfigurable hardware-here, mechanically tunable helices-can effectively counter Doppler and multi-path impairments. The findings inform new design principles for UAV antenna arrays and suggest a path toward AI-integrated adaptive RF systems for drone swarms and racing platforms.

Abstract: Underwater target tracking technology plays a pivotal role in marine resource exploration, environmental monitoring, and national defense security. Given that acoustic waves represent an effective medium for long-distance transmission in aquatic environments, underwater acoustic target tracking has become a prominent research area of underwater communications and networking. Existing literature reviews often offer a narrow perspective or inadequately address the paradigm shifts driven by emerging technologies like deep learning and reinforcement learning. To address these gaps, this work presents a systematic survey of this field and introduces an innovative multidimensional taxonomy framework based on target scale, sensor perception modes, and sensor collaboration patterns. Within this framework, we comprehensively survey the literature (more than 180 publications) over the period 2016-2025, spanning from the theoretical foundations to diverse algorithmic approaches in underwater acoustic target tracking. Particularly, we emphasize the transformative potential and recent advancements of machine learning techniques, including deep learning and reinforcement learning, in enhancing the performance and adaptability of underwater tracking systems. Finally, this survey concludes by identifying key challenges in the field and proposing future avenues based on emerging technologies such as federated learning, blockchain, embodied intelligence, and large models.

Conclusion: 论文提出的混合近远场活动检测方法在计算效率和性能上均表现出色，为大规模MIMO系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: A great amount of endeavor has recently been devoted to activity detection for massive machine-type communications in cell-free massive MIMO. However, in practice, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper considers a hybrid near-far field activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO, and establishes a covariance-based formulation, which facilitates the development of a distributed algorithm to alleviate the computational burden at the central processing unit (CPU). Specifically, each AP performs local activity detection for the devices and then transmits the detection result to the CPU for further processing. In particular, a novel coordinate descent algorithm based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury update with Taylor expansion is proposed to handle the local detection problem at each AP. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how the hybrid near-far field channels affect the detection performance. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing approaches.

Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that can implement a phase rotation continuously over the whole surface rather than via a finite number of discrete elements. Such an RIS can be considered a design for future systems where advances in metamaterials make such an implementation feasible or as the limiting case where the number of elements in a traditional RIS increases in a given area. We derive the optimal RIS design for the single-user (SU) scenario assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) from the RIS to the base station (BS) and correlated Rayleigh fading for the other links. We also derive the associated optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its mean, a bound on the mean spectral efficiency (SE), an approximation to the SNR outage probability and an approximation to the coefficient of variation for the investigation of channel hardening.

Result: CELM-WLLS在BER性能上比CELMAH提升约0.8 dB，计算复杂度降低三分之二。

Conclusion: CELM-WLLS在卫星通信中表现出更高的鲁棒性和效率，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Satellite communications are crucial for the evolution beyond fifth-generation networks. However, the dynamic nature of satellite channels and their inherent impairments present significant challenges. In this paper, a novel post-compensation scheme that combines the complex-valued extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (CELMAH) architecture and widely linear processing (WLP) is developed to address these issues by exploiting signal impropriety in satellite communications. Although CELMAH shares structural similarities with WLP, it employs a different core algorithm and does not fully exploit the signal impropriety. By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution.

Abstract: Phase distortion refers to the alteration of the phase relationships between frequencies in a signal, which can be perceptible. In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: 本文提出的噪声模型更准确地描述了阶梯APDs的噪声特性，验证了其与现有修正的一致性，为APDs的设计和应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are the solid-state analogue of photomultiplier tubes, owing to their deterministic amplification with twofold stepwise gain via impact ionization. Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks.
