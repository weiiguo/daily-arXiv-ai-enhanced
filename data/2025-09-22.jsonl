Traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods\nstruggle to generalize effectively across such diverse settings, particularly\nunder multitask and zero-shot scenarios. In this work, we propose MoE-CE, a\nflexible mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework designed to enhance the\ngeneralization capability of DL-based CE methods. MoE-CE provides an\nappropriate inductive bias by leveraging multiple expert subnetworks, each\nspecialized in distinct channel characteristics, and a learned router that\ndynamically selects the most relevant experts per input. This architecture\nenhances model capacity and adaptability without a proportional rise in\ncomputational cost while being agnostic to the choice of the backbone model and\nthe learning algorithm. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets\ngenerated under diverse SNRs, RB numbers, and channel profiles, including\nmultitask and zero-shot evaluations, we demonstrate that MoE-CE consistently\noutperforms conventional DL approaches, achieving significant performance gains\nwhile maintaining efficiency."}

This\nproblem is ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning yet remains\nchallenging to solve efficiently, particularly when large-scale instances, poor\nconditioning, and nonconvexity coincide. To address these challenges, we\npropose a proximal conjugate gradient method (PCG) that matches the fast\nconvergence of proximal (quasi-)Newton algorithms while reducing computation\nand memory complexity, and is especially effective for spectrally clustered\nHessians. Our key innovation is to form, at each iteration, an approximation to\nthe Newton direction based on CG iterations to build a majorization surrogate.\nWe define this surrogate in a curvature-aware manner and equip it with a\nCG-derived isotropic weight, guaranteeing majorization of a local second-order\nmodel of q along the given direction. To better preserve majorization after the\nproximal step and enable further approximation refinement, we scale the CG\ndirection by the ratio between the Cauchy step length and a step size derived\nfrom the largest Ritz value of the CG tridiagonal. All curvature is accessed\nvia Hessian-vector products computed by automatic differentiation, keeping the\nmethod Hessian-free. Convergence to first-order critical points is established.\nNumerical experiments on CS-MRI with nonconvex regularization and on dictionary\nlearning, against benchmark methods, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\napproach."}

While existing works on WCFM have\ndemonstrated its great potentials in various tasks including beam prediction,\nchannel prediction, localization, etc, the models are all trained using perfect\n(i.e., error-free and complete) channel information state (CSI) data which are\ngenerated with simulation tools. However, in practical systems where the WCFM\nis deployed, perfect CSI is not available. Instead, channel estimation needs to\nbe first performed based on pilot signals over a subset of the resource\nelements (REs) to acquire a noisy version of the CSI (termed as degraded CSI),\nwhich significantly differs from the perfect CSI in some real-world\nenvironments with severe noise and interference. As a result, the feature\nrepresentation generated by the WCFM is unable to reflect the characteristics\nof the true channel, yielding performance degradation in downstream tasks. To\naddress this issue, in this paper we propose an enhanced wireless channel\nfoundation model architecture with noise-plus-interference (NPI) suppression\ncapability. In our approach, coarse estimates of the CSIs are first obtained.\nWith these information, two projection matrices are computed to extract the NPI\nterms in the received signals, which are further processed by a NPI estimation\nand subtraction module. Finally, the resultant signal is passed through a CSI\ncompletion network to get a clean version of the CSI, which is used for feature\nextraction.

We\npresent the first study deploying encapsulated accelerometers mounted directly\non submerged impeller bowls, enabling in-situ vibration monitoring. Using a\nlab-scale pump setup with 1-meter oil submergence, we collected vibration data\nunder normal and simulated fault conditions. The data were analyzed using a\nsuite of machine learning models -- spanning traditional and deep learning\nmethods -- to evaluate sensor effectiveness.

Existing NF beam training methods\npredominantly rely on beam focusing, where the base station (BS) transmits\nhighly spatially selective beams to locate the user equipment (UE).

Moreover, as antenna counts grow and carrier\nwavelengths shrink, the channel model transits from far-field (FF) planar waves\nto near-field (NF) spherical waves, further complicating the beam training\nprocess. This paper focuses on millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems equipped with\nlarge-scale uniform planar arrays (UPAs), which produce 3D beam patterns and\nintroduce additional challenges for NF beam training. Existing methods\nprimarily rely on either FF steering or NF focusing codewords, both of which\nare highly sensitive to mismatches in user equipment (UE) location, leading to\nhigh sensitivity to even slight mismatch and excessive training overhead. In\ncontrast, we introduce a novel beam training approach leveraging the\nbeam-diverging effect, which enables adjustable wide-beam coverage using only a\nsingle radio frequency (RF) chain.
