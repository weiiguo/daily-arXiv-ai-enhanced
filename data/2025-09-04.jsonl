However, this flexibility\nalso introduces significant challenges for existing successive cancellation\n(SC) based decoding schemes. Motivated by the need for a general SC decoding\nsolution, we present a comprehensive decoding strategy for monotone chain polar\ncodes that can handle arbitrary numbers of terminals, non-binary alphabets, and\ndecoding along arbitrary monotone chains. Specifically, we formulate the SC\ndecoding task as a series of inference subtasks over the polar transform and\npropose a computational graph framework based on probability propagation\nprinciples. This approach highlights the impact of variable switching during\ndecoding and shows that time complexity varies between $O(N\\log{N})$ and\n$O(N^2)$, depending on the specific chain structure. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat the widely used $O(N)$ space optimization is not universally applicable to\nmonotone chain polar codes, which prompts us to introduce a constant-time\ndecoder forking strategy based on the proposed logical computation graphs. This\nstrategy enables time-efficient list decoding without relying on $O(N)$-space\ntechniques.

Since the legacy wireless systems\nwere designed based on often decades-old assumptions about wireless\ninterference, utilizing these new bands will result in interference with the\nexisting legacy users. Many of these legacy wireless devices are used by\ncritical infrastructure networks upon which society depends. There is an urgent\nneed to develop schemes that can protect legacy users from such interference.\nFor many applications, legacy users are located within\ngeographically-constrained regions. Several studies have proposed mitigating\ninterference through the implementation of exclusion zones near these\ngeographically-constrained regions. In contrast to solutions based on\ngeographic exclusion zones, this paper presents a communication theory-based\nsolution. By leveraging knowledge of these geographically-constrained regions,\nwe aim to reduce the interference impact on legacy users.

In this paper, we address this issue by optimizing the transmitted\nconstellation under mixed noise based on a theoretical analysis of the cutoff\nrate (CR). First, starting from the passband model of the mixed noise, we\nderive its corresponding baseband representation. Due to the complexity of the\nCR, an exact analytic expression is generally intractable. Therefore, the\nbaseband noise model is employed to obtain closed-form lower and upper bounds\nof the CR. A piecewise linear approximation is applied to derive efficient\nbounds by exploiting the algebraic properties of the integral terms. These\nbounds are then used as criteria to optimize the transmitted constellation\npoints in both geometric and probabilistic distributions. The projected\ngradient method is employed to solve the optimization problem, and the\nconvergence and properties of the solutions are analyzed. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed CR bounds are tight and exhibit the expected\nasymptotic behavior. Furthermore, the optimized constellation scheme achieves a\nsignificant rate improvement compared to baselines."}

In this work, we propose a HAD architecture\nthat employs Butler matrices to synthesize DFT beams over a uniform linear\narray. By exploiting the Cauchy-like displacement structure of the beamformed\nsignal, we introduce a second-order statistics estimation algorithm that\nachieves near-optimal accuracy, approaching the Cram\\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB)\nand outperforming state-of-the-art methods in simulation."}
