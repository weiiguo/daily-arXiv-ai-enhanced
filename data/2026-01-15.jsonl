However, its practical deployment remains hindered by strong residual self-interference and inter-user interference, which severely degrade system performance. This work investigates a full-duplex MISO network that leverages movable-antenna base stations (MA-BS) and movable-element reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ME-RIS) to overcome these limitations in next-generation 6G systems. Unlike conventional fixed-geometry architectures, the proposed framework jointly optimizes antenna and RIS element positions, together with RIS phase shifts, to strengthen desired links while suppressing interference. Our design objective is to maximize the system sum rate through the joint optimization of transmit and receive beamforming vectors, uplink transmit powers, RIS phase shifts, and the spatial locations of both the BS antennas and RIS elements. To solve this challenging nonconvex problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed, employing semidefinite relaxation for beamforming design and successive convex approximation for position optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ME-RIS-assisted architecture with movable BS antennas offers substantial gains over conventional fixed-position full-duplex networks. These findings highlight the potential of integrating movable antennas with movable RIS elements as a key enabler for high-performance full-duplex operation in future 6G wireless systems."}

Despite their central role in LLM pipelines, the link between tokenization, compression efficiency and induced structure is not well understood. We empirically demonstrate that tokenizer training scale redistributes entropy: as training data grows, the token stream becomes more diverse in aggregate (higher unigram entropy) yet markedly more predictable in-context (lower higher-order conditional entropies), indicating that tokenization absorbs substantial short-range regularity although these gains degrade under train-test domain mismatch. To ground these observations, we first benchmark i) pretrained GPT-family tokenizers as black-box compressors across various domains, and ii) learned tokenizers across configurations spanning vocabulary size, training scale, and domain. Next, we study tokenization as a transform for universal compression and introduce a compression-aware BPE variant. Finally, we adopt a channel lens and introduce capacity-utilization metrics to analyze tokenizer behaviour and outline implications for downstream modeling. Put together, our results expose various trade-offs between compression, induced structure, and robustness under domain shift, and motivate principled, compression-aware tokenizer design."}

To reveal the fundamental performance limit of the proposed hybrid sensing mode, we derive closed-form Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing target localization and velocity estimation, as functions of target and UE positions. The results reveal that significant performance gains can be achieved over the purely mono- or bi-static sensing, especially when the BS-target-UE form a favorable geometry, which is close to a right triangle.

Revised version in preparation for journal submission", "summary": "Reliable river flow forecasting is an essential component of flood risk management and early warning systems. It enables improved emergency response coordination and is critical for protecting infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems from extreme hydrological events. Process-based hydrological models and purely data-driven approaches often underperform during extreme events, particularly in forecasting peak flows. To address this limitation, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that couples Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF). XGBoost is employed for continuous streamflow forecasting, while RF is specifically trained for peak-flow prediction, and the two outputs are combined into an enhanced forecast. The approach is implemented across 857 catchments of the LamaH-CE dataset, using rainfall and discharge observations at 6-hour resolution. Results demonstrate consistently high skill, with 71% of catchments achieving a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) greater than 0.90. Peak-flow detection reaches 87%, with a false-alarm rate of 13%. Compared to the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), the framework achieves lower peak-magnitude errors, fewer false alarms, and improved streamflow and peak-flow forecasting accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally lightweight, scalable, and easily transferable across watersheds, with training times of only seconds on standard CPUs. These findings highlight the potential of integrating hydrological understanding with efficient machine learning to improve the accuracy and reliability of operational flood forecasting, and outline future directions for hybrid hydrological-machine learning model development."}

However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, making hardware remedies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) impractical. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves an SNR improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations.

Oversampling and pulse shaping are also discussed in the existing literature, but not in the context of channel estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to address the problem of data-to-pilot and vice versa energy leakage caused by oversampling and pulse shaping in OTFS. Theoretical analysis is performed on an oversampled, pulse-shaped OTFS implementing the embedded pilot channel estimation technique, revealing a trade-off between the amount of energy leakage and excess bandwidth introduced by the pulse shape. Next, a novel variant of OTFS is introduced, called UW-OTFS, which is designed to overcome the leakage problem by placing the pilot in the oversampled time domain instead of the DD domain. The unique structure of UW-OTFS offers 36 percent higher spectral efficiency than the OTFS with embedded pilot. UW-OTFS also outperforms traditional OTFS in terms of bit error ratio and out-of-band emissions."}

This paper presents ServaStack: a universal data format (.serva) paired with a universal AI compute engine (Chimera). The .serva format achieves lossless compression by encoding information using laser holography principles, while Chimera converts compute operations into a representational space where computation occurs directly on .serva files without decompression. The result is automatic data preprocessing. The Chimera engine enables any existing model to operate on .serva data without retraining, preserving infrastructure investments while revamping efficiency. Internal benchmarks demonstrate 30-374x energy efficiency improvements (96-99% reduction), 4x-34x lossless storage compression, and 68x compute payload reduction without accuracy loss when compared to RNN, CNN, and MLP models on FashionMNIST and MNIST datasets.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-cell cooperative air-computation framework assisted by dual-polarized movable antennas (D-PMA), and formulates a mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem by jointly optimizing the combining matrix, polarization vectors, antenna positions, and user transmit coefficients. The resulting problem is highly nonconvex, so an alternating algorithm is developed in which closed-form updates are obtained for the combining matrix and transmit coefficients. Then a method based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is proposed to refine polarization vectors, and the antenna positions are updated using a gradient-based method. In addition, we develop a statistical-channel-based scheme for optimizing the antenna locations, and we further present the corresponding algorithm to efficiently obtain the solution.

Specifically, IRSs are selectively deployed from candidate sites to shape the propagation geometry, while MAs are locally repositioned among discretized locations to exploit small-scale channel variations. The objective is to minimize the total deployment cost of MAs and IRSs by jointly optimizing the IRS site selection, MA positions, transmit precoding, and IRS phase shifts, subject to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for all target areas. This leads to a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem that is intractable to solve directly. To address this, we first formulate an auxiliary problem to verify the feasibility. A penalty-based double-loop algorithm integrating alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA) is developed to solve this feasibility issue, which is subsequently adapted to obtain a suboptimal solution for the original cost minimization problem. Finally, based on the obtained solution, we formulate an element refinement problem to further reduce the deployment cost, which is solved by a penalty-based SCA algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed designs consistently outperform benchmarks relying on independent area planning or full IRS deployment in terms of cost-efficiency. Moreover, for cost minimization, MA architectures are preferable in large placement apertures, whereas fully populated FPA architectures excel in compact ones; for worst-case SNR maximization, MA architectures exhibit a lower cost threshold for feasibility, while FPA architectures can attain peak SNR at a lower total cost."}

The Gutman test for this problem compares the empirical distributions of the observed sequences and decides on the null hypothesis if the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between these empirical distributions is below a given threshold. This paper proposes a generalization of the Gutman test, termed \\emph{divergence test}, which replaces the JS divergence by an arbitrary divergence. For this test, the exponential decay of the type-II error probability for a fixed type-I error probability is studied. First, it is shown that the divergence test achieves the optimal first-order exponent, irrespective of the choice of divergence. Second, it is demonstrated that the divergence test with an invariant divergence achieves the same second-order asymptotics as the Gutman test. In addition, it is shown that the Gutman test is the GLRT for the two-sample testing problem, and a connection between two-sample testing and robust goodness-of-fit testing is established."}

A space-time reconfigurable intelligent surface (ST-RIS) impresses a continuous-phase modulation onto the radar echo, enabling uplink data transmission with a phase modulation of the transmitted radar-like waveform. The received signal is a multiplicative composition of the sensing waveform and the phase for communication. Both functionalities share the same physical signal and perceive each other as impairments.\n  The achievable communication rate is expressed as a function of a coupling parameter that links sensing accuracy to phase error accumulation. Under a fixed bandwidth constraint, the sensing and communication figures of merit define a convex Pareto frontier. The optimal bandwidth allocation satisfying a minimum sensing requirement is derived in closed form. The modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) for range estimation is derived in closed form; this parameter must be estimated to compensate for the frequency offset before data demodulation. Frame synchronization is formulated as a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and the detection probability is obtained through characteristic function inversion, accounting for residual frequency errors from imperfect range estimation.

This work presents a systematic, power-system-oriented evaluation of a GAN-LSTM framework for smart meter anomaly detection using the Large-scale Energy Anomaly Detection (LEAD) dataset, which contains one year of hourly measurements from 406 buildings. The proposed pipeline applies consistent preprocessing, temporal windowing, and threshold selection across all methods, and compares the GAN-LSTM approach against six widely used baselines, including statistical, kernel-based, reconstruction-based, and GAN-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-LSTM significantly improves detection performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.89.

First, we derive the optimal latent variance as the second moment under a Gaussian assumption, providing a principled alternative to hyperprior-based estimation. Second, we quantify the gap between uniform quantization and the Gaussian test channel derived from the reverse water-filling theorem. Third, we extend our framework to include context modeling, and demonstrate that accurate mean prediction yields substantial entropy reduction. Unlike prior R-D estimators, our method provides a structurally interpretable perspective that aligns with real compression modules and enables fine-grained analysis.

However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, making hardware remedies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) impractical. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves an SNR improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS."}

The first metric is called repair bandwidth, which measures the network resources required during the repair process. Another critical metric for repair efficiency is disk I/O cost, defined as the amount of data packets accessed at helper nodes to repair the failed node. In an encoding scheme with optimal I/O cost, the number of packets sent to the newcomer is exactly the same as the number of packets read from memory. This mode of repair is referred to as uncoded repair, as no coding operations are performed at the helper node. In addition to minimizing disk I/O cost, an uncoded repair mechanism has the advantage of incurring minimal computational overhead at the helper node. In this paper, we demonstrate that for single node failures, if all surviving nodes participate in the repair of the failed node, we can achieve all points on the fundamental tradeoff curve between storage and repair bandwidth. The design of the proposed encoding scheme is based on the theory of gammoids, a specialized class of graph-based matroids. We prove that this scheme can tolerate an unlimited number of node repair iterations over a field of fixed size."}

Despite this relevance, the asymptotic behavior of the inclusive variant of disjunct matrices has remained largely unexplored. In particular, it was not previously known whether this variant can achieve an asymptotically positive rate, a requirement for scalable group testing designs. In this work, we establish the first nontrivial asymptotic lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of the inclusive variant, which matches the strongest known upper bound up to a logarithmic factor.

In this paper, we focus on wideband cell-free multi-RIS-empowered Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) systems and present a decentralized cooperative active and passive beamforming scheme, aiming to provide an efficient alternative towards the cooperation overhead of available centralized schemes depending on central processing unit. Considering imperfect channel information availability and realistic frequency selectivity behavior of each RIS's element response, we devise a distributed optimization approach based on consensus updates for the RISs' phase configurations. Our simulation results showcase that the proposed distributed design is superior to centralized schemes that are based on various Lorentzian-type wideband modeling approaches for the RISs."}
