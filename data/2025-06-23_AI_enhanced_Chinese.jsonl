However, the intricate relationships between\nthe signal carrier wavelength and the transceiver region size lead to\ninaccuracies in traditional far-field 6DMA channel model, causing discrepancies\nbetween the model predictions and the hybrid-field channel characteristics in\npractical 6DMA systems, where users might be in the far-field region relative\nto the antennas on the same 6DMA surface, while simultaneously being in the\nnear-field region relative to different 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, due to the\nhigh-dimensional channel and the coupled position and rotation constraints, the\nestimation of the 6DMA channel and the joint design of the 6DMA positions and\nrotations and the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) incur extremely\nhigh computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose an efficient\nhybrid-field generalized 6DMA channel model, which accounts for planar-wave\npropagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical-wave propagation\namong different 6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, by leveraging directional sparsity,\nwe propose a low-overhead channel estimation algorithm that efficiently\nconstructs a complete channel map for all potential antenna position-rotation\npairs while limiting the training overhead incurred by antenna movement. In\naddition, we propose a low-complexity design leveraging deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL), which facilitates the joint design of the 6DMA positions,\nrotations, and beamforming in a unified manner.

Employing this approach enables\nsimultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while\nproviding a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The\nproposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,\ntreating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input\nsamples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to\nestimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and\noptimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves\na two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training\nphase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step\nestimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the\nimprovement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI\nestimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is\nused to construct polar codes.

One of its key advantages\nis that it extends compression methods to continuous spaces and can thus be\nintegrated more seamlessly into modern machine learning pipelines than\nclassical quantisation-based approaches. Furthermore, it is a natural\nfoundation for developing advanced compression methods that are\nprivacy-preserving or account for the perceptual quality of the reconstructed\ndata.\n  The thesis considers relative entropy coding at three conceptual levels:\nAfter introducing the basics of the framework, (1) I prove results that provide\nnew, maximally tight fundamental limits to the communication and computational\nefficiency of relative entropy coding; (2) I use the theory of Poisson point\nprocesses to develop and analyse new relative entropy coding algorithms, whose\nperformance attains the theoretic optima and (3) I showcase the strong\npractical performance of relative entropy coding by applying it to image,\naudio, video and protein data compression using small, energy-efficient,\nprobabilistic neural networks called Bayesian implicit neural representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u6e90\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u9700\u8981\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5982\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u7f16\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u7f16\u7801\uff1a1) \u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cca\u677e\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Current ISAC systems\npredominantly rely on deterministic pilot signals within the signal frame to\naccomplish sensing tasks. However, these pilot signals typically occupy only a\nsmall portion, e.g., 0.15% to 25%, of the time-frequency resources. To enhance\nthe system utility, a promising solution is to repurpose the extensive random\ndata payload signals for sensing tasks. In this paper, we analyze the ISAC\nperformance of a multi-antenna system where both deterministic pilot and random\ndata symbols are employed for sensing tasks. By capitalizing on random matrix\ntheory (RMT), we first derive a semi-closed-form asymptotic expression of the\nergodic linear minimum mean square error (ELMMSE). Then, we formulate an ISAC\nprecoding optimization problem to minimize the ELMMSE, which is solved via a\nspecifically tailored successive convex approximation (SAC) algorithm. To\nprovide system insights, we further derive a closed-form expression for the\nasymptotic ELMMSE at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our analysis reveals\nthat, compared with conventional sensing implemented by deterministic signals,\nthe sensing performance degradation induced by random signals is critically\ndetermined by the ratio of the transmit antenna size to the data symbol length.\nBased on this result, the ISAC precoding optimization problem at high SNRs is\ntransformed into a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved.\nSimulation results validate the accuracy of the derived asymptotic expressions\nof ELMMSE and the performance of the proposed precoding schemes. Particularly,\nby leveraging data payload signals for sensing tasks, the sensing error is\nreduced by up to 5.6 dB compared to conventional pilot-based sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u9891\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u53476G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u4fe1\u53f7\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u6e10\u8fdb\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7b80\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e5.6 dB\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u5929\u7ebf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we\npropose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design\nlow-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed\narchitecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN\nlog N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs\nrequire only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an\nexplicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI)\nestimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS\nchannels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal\ndecoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower\ncomplexity than trellis-based decoders. We also provide numerical estimates of\nthe channel capacity for the deletion channel. We extend our evaluation to\nrealistic DNA storage settings, including channels with multiple noisy reads\nand real-world Nanopore sequencing data.

In Part I, digital OAC was formulated as a\nnoise-aware constellation design problem by casting encoder design as a max-min\noptimization that aligns minimum Euclidean distances between superimposed\nconstellation points with squared differences of their corresponding function\noutputs.\n  In this paper, Part II, we address the prohibitive complexity and\nquantization challenges inherent in digital OAC constellation design for\nlarge-scale edge networks. More precisely, we introduce a pyramid sampling\nstrategy that judiciously selects a subset of superimposed constellation points\nto reduce the encoder design complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(q^K)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(q^{K-p+1})$, where $p\\in\\{1,\\dots, K\\}$ denotes the sampling\norder, $q$ levels of modulation, and $K$ denotes the number nodes in the\nnetwork.

In this paper, we present a mean-field-approximation-based\ninvestigation on two out of six use case scenarios defined by IMT-2030, namely,\nmassive communication and ubiquitous connectivity. Being aware of the\nlimitation in interference cancellation owing to constrained cost and hardware\ncomplexity, we investigate the spectrum reuse architecture in both usage\nscenarios. We propose a tractable spectrum reuse with low signaling overhead\nconsumed for channel estimation and channel state information (CSI) feedback.\nOur analysis indicates that the massive communication over cellular and\ndevice-to-device (D2D) networks can benefit from channel orthogonalization,\nwhile it is unnecessary to share the CSI of interfering links. Moreover,\ndeploying relays or movable base stations, e.g. unmanned aerial vehicle, yields\nsubstantial energy and spectrum gain for ubiquitous connectivity, despite\nintroducing interference.
