We derive bounds on the size of the vertices in\nregular bipartite graphs, showing how the required number of check nodes grows\nwith respect to the number of variable nodes as girth grows large. Furthermore,\nwe present two constructions for bipartite graphs with girth $\\mathcal{G} = 8$;\none based on a greedy construction of $(w_c, w_r)$-regular graphs, and another\nbased on semi-regular graphs which have uniform column weight distribution with\na sublinear number of check nodes.

By leveraging the distribution information\nof terrestrial UTs, we first establish an interference model from the satellite\nto terrestrial systems without shared CSI. Based on this, robust TX beamforming\nschemes are developed under both the interference threshold and the power\nbudget. Two optimization criteria are considered: satellite weighted sum rate\nmaximization and mean square error minimization. The former achieves a superior\nachievable rate performance through an iterative optimization framework,\nwhereas the latter enables a low-complexity closed-form solution at the expense\nof reduced rate, with interference constraints satisfied via a bisection\nmethod. To avoid complex integral calculations and the dependence on user\ndistribution information in inter-system interference evaluations, we propose a\nterrestrial base station position-aided approximation method, and the\napproximation errors are subsequently analyzed. Numerical simulations validate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed schemes."}

In this paper, we investigate\nuplink DMRS-based channel estimation for MU-MIMO systems with Type II OCC\npattern standardized in 3GPP Release 18, leveraging location-specific\nstatistical channel state information (SCSI) to enhance performance.\nSpecifically, we propose a SCSI-assisted Bayesian channel estimator (SA-BCE)\nbased on the minimum mean square error criterion to suppress the pilot\ninterference and noise, albeit at the cost of cubic computational complexity\ndue to matrix inversions. To reduce this complexity while maintaining\nperformance, we extend the scheme to a windowed version (SA-WBCE), which\nincorporates antenna-frequency domain windowing and beam-delay domain\nprocessing to exploit asymptotic sparsity and mitigate energy leakage in\npractical systems. To avoid the frequent real-time SCSI acquisition, we\nconstruct a grid-based location-specific SCSI database based on the principle\nof spatial consistency, and subsequently leverage the uplink received signals\nwithin each grid to extract the SCSI. Facilitated by the multilinear structure\nof wireless channels, we formulate the SCSI acquisition problem within each\ngrid as a tensor decomposition problem, where the factor matrices are\nparameterized by the multi-path powers, delays, and angles. The computational\ncomplexity of SCSI acquisition can be significantly reduced by exploiting the\nVandermonde structure of the factor matrices. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed location-specific SCSI database construction method achieves\nhigh accuracy, while the SA-BCE and SA-WBCE significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks in MU-MIMO systems."}

In compress-forward\nmode, remote radio heads (RRHs) compress the received signal and forward it to\na central unit for joint processing. While previous work has focused on a\ntransform-based approach, which optimizes the transform matrix that reduces\nsignals of high dimension to a static pre-determined lower dimension, we\npropose a rate-based approach that simultaneously finds both dimension and\ncompression adaptively. Our approach accommodates for changes to network\ntraffic and fronthaul limits. Using mutual information as the objective, we\nobtain the theoretical network capacity for adaptive compression and decouple\nthe expression to enable decentralization. Furthermore, using channel\nstatistics and user traffic density, we show different approaches to compute an\nefficient representation of side information that summarizes global channel\nstate information and is shared with RRHs to assist compression. While keeping\nthe information exchange overhead low, our decentralized implementation of\nadaptive compression shows competitive overall network performance compared to\na centralized approach."}
