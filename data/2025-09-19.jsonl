In return, the PT's performance can be enhanced by SU's\nbackscattered signal, forming a mutualistic relationship. However, the low\nmodulation rate causes extremely inferior transmission rates for SUs. To\nimprove the SU transmission rate, this paper proposes a new mutualistic SR with\nHAPC to explore the tradeoff between BC and AC in terms of power consumption\nand transmission rate, enabling each SU to transmit signal via passive BC and\nAC alternatively. We propose two problems to maximize the total rate of all SUs\nunder the fixed and dynamic SIC ordering, respectively. The fixed SIC\nordering-based problem is to jointly optimize the SUs' reflection coefficients,\nthe transmit power of each SU during AC, and the time allocation for each SU\nduring BC and AC, subject to the energy causality constraint and the PT's\ntransmission rate gain constraint. In addition to pondering the constraints\ninvolved in the fixed SIC ordering-based problem, the dynamic SIC\nordering-based problem, which is a mixed integer programming one, further\nconsiders the SIC ordering constraint. The above two problems are solved by our\nproposed SCA-based and BCD-based iterative algorithms, respectively. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that: 1) the proposed mutualistic SR system outperforms\ntraditional designs in terms of the rates achieved by SUs under the same\nconstraints; 2) the total rate of all SUs under the dynamic SIC ordering is\nlarger than that of the fixed one when the PT's minimum rate gain is high, and\nbecomes nearly identical when the PT's minimum rate gain is low."}

To derive the exact-optimal solution to the\nMMF problem (as opposed to approximations), conventional methods usually\ninvolve two steps: first calculate the scheduling rate region, and then find\nthe maximum multiflow that can be supported by the achievable link rates.\nHowever, the NP-hardness of the scheduling part makes solving the MMF problem\nin large networks computationally prohibitive. In this paper, while still\nfocusing on the exact-optimal solution, we provide efficient algorithms that\ncan jointly calculate the scheduling rate region and solve the MMF problem,\nthereby outputting optimal values without requiring the entire scheduling rate\nregion.

Recent\nstudies have proposed various H-NOMA systems by employing different successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC) methods for the NOMA transmission phase.\nHowever, existing analyses typically assume a fixed channel gain order between\npaired users, despite the fact that channel coefficients follow random\ndistribution, leading to their magnitude relationships inherently stochastic\nand time varying. This paper analyzes the performance of three H-NOMA schemes\nunder stochastic channel gain ordering: a) fixed order SIC (FSIC) aided H-NOMA\nscheme; b) hybrid SIC with non-power adaptation (HSIC-NPA) aided H-NOMA scheme;\nc) hybrid SIC with power adaptation (HSIC-PA) aided H-NOMA scheme.

This is achieved by designing a sampling\noperator by an optimization problem, which is inherently non-convex, as the\nbest possible recovery imposes a rank constraint. An existing method for\nvertex-wise flexible sampling is able to control the number of active vertices\nbut cannot incorporate prior knowledge of mandatory or forbidden vertices. To\naddress these challenges, we formulate the operator design as a problem that\nhandles a constraint of the number of active vertices and prior knowledge on\nspecific vertices for sampling, mandatory inclusion or exclusion. We\ntransformed this constrained problem into a difference-of-convex (DC)\noptimization problem by using the nuclear norm and a DC penalty for vertex\nselection. To solve this, we develop a convergent solver based on the general\ndouble-proximal gradient DC algorithm.

For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB\nis derived in closed form. Notably, the resulting CRB decreases cubically with\nsensing time in the time-constrained regime, whereas it decreases linearly with\nsensing time and quadratically with the movement line segment's length in the\nspace-constrained regime. For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of\nmaximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the\nhorizontal and vertical axes.
