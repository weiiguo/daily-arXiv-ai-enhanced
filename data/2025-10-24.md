### [1] [Information Gradient for Nonlinear Gaussian Channel with Applications to Task-Oriented Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20179)
*Tadashi Wadayama*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了基于梯度的参数化非线性高斯信道优化框架，通过互信息最大化实现。利用SFB方法推导出计算可行的信息梯度公式，无需显式计算输出分布即可端到端优化非线性前端。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在优化非线性高斯信道时面临计算复杂性挑战，需要开发更高效的信息梯度计算方法来实现端到端优化。

Method: 采用SFB方法，将信息梯度表示为边际输出分布的得分函数（通过DSM学习）和前端函数雅可比矩阵（通过VJP自动微分）的组合，实现梯度上升优化。

Result: 实验验证了信息梯度公式的正确性，证明该方法能有效优化线性和非线性信道达到目标。

Conclusion: 该框架为非线性高斯信道优化提供了实用的梯度计算方法，支持端到端优化和任务导向场景扩展。

Abstract: We propose a gradient-based framework for optimizing parametric nonlinear
Gaussian channels via mutual information maximization. Leveraging the
score-to-Fisher bridge (SFB) methodology, we derive a computationally tractable
formula for the information gradient that is the gradient of mutual information
with respect to the parameters of the nonlinear front-end. Our formula
expresses this gradient in terms of two key components: the score function of
the marginal output distribution, which can be learned via denoising score
matching (DSM), and the Jacobian of the front-end function, which is handled
efficiently using the vector-Jacobian product (VJP) within automatic
differentiation frameworks. This enables practical parameter optimization
through gradient ascent. Furthermore, we extend this framework to task-oriented
scenarios, deriving gradients for both task-specific mutual information, where
a task variable depends on the channel input, and the information bottleneck
(IB) objective. A key advantage of our approach is that it facilitates
end-to-end optimization of the nonlinear front-end without requiring explicit
computation on the output distribution. Extensive experimental validation
confirms the correctness of our information gradient formula against analytical
solutions and demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing both linear and
nonlinear channels toward their objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络信息论中的二阶可达性界存在改进空间，特别是在有损源编码和带成本的信道编码方面，需要更通用的分析框架来获得更紧的边界。

Method: 提出了类型偏差收敛的二阶可达性框架，通过分析类型偏差的收敛特性来推导可达性界，适用于多种网络信息论场景。

Result: 为Wyner-Ziv问题提供了改进的二阶可达性界，优于Watanabe-Kuzuoka-Tan、Yassaee-Aref-Gohari和Li-Anantharam等人的结果；同时改进了Heegard-Berger问题和带成本的Gelfand-Pinsker问题的二阶可达性界。

Conclusion: 类型偏差收敛框架是分析网络信息论中二阶可达性的有效工具，能够在多个重要场景下获得比现有方法更优的性能边界。

Abstract: We propose a framework for second-order achievability, called type deviation
convergence, that is generally applicable to settings in network information
theory, and is especially suitable for lossy source coding and channel coding
with cost. We give a second-order achievability bound for lossy source coding
with side information at the decoder (Wyner-Ziv problem) that improves upon all
known bounds (e.g., Watanabe-Kuzuoka-Tan, Yassaee-Aref-Gohari and
Li-Anantharam). We also give second-order achievability bounds for lossy
compression where side information may be absent (Heegard-Berger problem) and
channels with noncausal state information at the encoder and cost constraint
(Gelfand-Pinsker problem with cost) that improve upon previous bounds.

### [3] [A Location-Aware Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Dynamic Near-Far Field Channel Estimation in Low-Altitude UAV Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20277)
*Wenli Yuan,Kan Yu,Xiaowu Liu,Kaixuan Li,Qixun Zhang,Zhiyong Feng*

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信道估计方法依赖远场假设，无法捕捉近场场景中的复杂信道变化，且忽略了实时收发器位置等有价值的几何先验信息。

Method: 结合CNN进行空间特征提取、BiLSTM网络建模时间演化、多头自注意力机制增强对判别性信道分量的关注，并将实时收发器位置嵌入作为几何先验。

Conclusion: 所提出的位置感知混合深度学习框架能够有效解决低空无人机通信中的信道估计问题，在混合近远场传播条件下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In low altitude UAV communications, accurate channel estimation remains
challenging due to the dynamic nature of air to ground links, exacerbated by
high node mobility and the use of large scale antenna arrays, which introduce
hybrid near and far field propagation conditions. While conventional estimation
methods rely on far field assumptions, they fail to capture the intricate
channel variations in near-field scenarios and overlook valuable geometric
priors such as real-time transceiver positions. To overcome these limitations,
this paper introduces a unified channel estimation framework based on a
location aware hybrid deep learning architecture. The proposed model
synergistically combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial
feature extraction, bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) networks for
modeling temporal evolution, and a multihead self attention mechanism to
enhance focus on discriminative channel components. Furthermore, real-time
transmitter and receiver locations are embedded as geometric priors, improving
sensitivity to distance under near field spherical wavefronts and boosting
model generalization. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, showing that it outperforms existing benchmarks by a
significant margin, achieving at least a 30.25% reduction in normalized mean
square error (NMSE) on average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可移动天线技术面临实时优化计算复杂度高和机械移动速度与信道变化速度不匹配的挑战，现有学习方法忽略了通信领域特定的对抗性交互知识。

Method: 将天线定位问题重构为预测任务，使用基于Transformer的框架，包含角色感知嵌入、物理信息语义特征和复合损失函数三个关键组件。

Conclusion: RoleAware-MAPP框架通过融入领域知识，显著提升了可移动天线在物理层安全中的性能，并在不同用户速度和噪声条件下保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology provides a promising avenue for actively
shaping wireless channels through dynamic antenna positioning, thereby enabling
electromagnetic radiation reconstruction to enhance physical layer security
(PLS). However, its practical deployment is hindered by two major challenges:
the high computational complexity of real time optimization and a critical
temporal mismatch between slow mechanical movement and rapid channel
variations. Although data driven methods have been introduced to alleviate
online optimization burdens, they are still constrained by suboptimal training
labels derived from conventional solvers or high sample complexity in
reinforcement learning. More importantly, existing learning based approaches
often overlook communication-specific domain knowledge, particularly the
asymmetric roles and adversarial interactions between legitimate users and
eavesdroppers, which are fundamental to PLS. To address these issues, this
paper reformulates the MA positioning problem as a predictive task and
introduces RoleAware-MAPP, a novel Transformer based framework that
incorporates domain knowledge through three key components: role-aware
embeddings that model user specific intentions, physics-informed semantic
features that encapsulate channel propagation characteristics, and a composite
loss function that strategically prioritizes secrecy performance over mere
geometric accuracy. Extensive simulations under 3GPP-compliant scenarios show
that RoleAware-MAPP achieves an average secrecy rate of 0.3569 bps/Hz and a
strictly positive secrecy capacity of 81.52%, outperforming the strongest
baseline by 48.4% and 5.39 percentage points, respectively, while maintaining
robust performance across diverse user velocities and noise conditions.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) is a promising enabler for
next-generation high-capacity networks that exhibit better performance compared
to its single-layer counterpart by means of just wave propagation. However, the
study of ergodic mutual information (EMI) and outage probability for
SIM-assisted multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems is not available in
the literature. To this end, we obtain the distribution of the MI by using
large random matrix theory (RMT) tools. Next, we derive a tight closed-form
expression for the outage probability based on statistical channel state
information (CSI). Moreover, we apply the gradient descent method for the
minimization of the outage probability. Simulation results verify the
analytical results and provide fundamental insights such as the performance
enhancements compared to conventional MIMO systems and the single-layer
counterpart. Notably the proposed optimization algorithm is faster than the
alternating optimization (AO) benchmark by saving significant overhead.

Conclusion: 该安全ALCC框架能有效对抗拜占庭攻击，包括利用浮点精度噪声的合谋攻击，为分布式计算提供了更强的安全保障。

Abstract: Analog Lagrange Coded Computing (ALCC) is a recently proposed computational
paradigm wherein certain computations over analog datasets are efficiently
performed using distributed worker nodes through floating point representation.
While the vanilla version of ALCC is known to preserve the privacy of the
datasets from the workers and also achieve resilience against stragglers, it is
not robust against Byzantine workers that return erroneous results.
Highlighting this vulnerability, we propose a secure ALCC framework that is
resilient against a wide range of integrity threats from the Byzantine workers.
As a foundational step, we use error-correction algorithms for Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) codes to build novel reconstruction strategies for ALCC thereby
improving its computational accuracy in the presence of a bounded number of
Byzantine workers. Furthermore, capitalizing on some theoretical results on the
performance of the DFT decoders, we propose novel strategies for distributing
the ALCC computational tasks to the workers, and show that such methods
significantly improve the accuracy when the workers' trust profiles are
available at the master server. Finally, we study the robustness of the
proposed framework against colluding attacks, and show that interesting attack
strategies can be executed by exploiting the inherent precision noise owing to
floating point implementation.

### [7] [Adversary-Aware Private Inference over Wireless Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20518)
*Mohamed Seif,Malcolm Egan,Andrea J. Goldsmith,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于隐私保护AI感知的新框架，设备在将提取的特征传输到模型服务器之前应用特征变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘网络中，传感器和模型服务器通常不位于同一位置，需要传输特征。由于敏感个人数据可能被对手重建，需要对特征进行变换以减少隐私泄露风险。

Method: 设备在传输提取的特征到模型服务器之前应用特征变换。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了在AI感知中保护个人特征隐私的问题。

Abstract: AI-based sensing at wireless edge devices has the potential to significantly
enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, particularly for vision and
perception tasks such as in autonomous driving and environmental monitoring. AI
systems rely both on efficient model learning and inference. In the inference
phase, features extracted from sensing data are utilized for prediction tasks
(e.g., classification or regression). In edge networks, sensors and model
servers are often not co-located, which requires communication of features. As
sensitive personal data can be reconstructed by an adversary, transformation of
the features are required to reduce the risk of privacy violations. While
differential privacy mechanisms provide a means of protecting finite datasets,
protection of individual features has not been addressed. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where
devices apply transformations of extracted features before transmission to a
model server.

Abstract: Fluid antenna is a promising wireless communication technology that enhances
communication rate by changing the antenna positions. This article proposes a
new communication system that combines multiple-input single-output (MISO)
fluid antennas with traditional fixed-position antennas, utilizing antenna
position optimization to improve energy harvesting efficiency. In this model,
we consider simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) which
transmits identical signals from the base station to both information receiver

ER by fine-tuning the positions of transmit and receive fluid antennas, along
with optimizing the transmit covariance matrix, subject to a given minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint at the IR. Simulation
results indicate that fluid antenna systems significantly enhance the energy
harvesting efficiency of the ER compared to traditional fixed-position
antennas.

### [10] [Super-Linear Growth of the Capacity-Achieving Input Support for the Amplitude-Constrained AWGN Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20723)
*Haiyang Wang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了幅度受限AWGN信道容量达到输入分布支撑点数量的增长特性，证明了支撑点数量随幅度约束A的增加呈超线性增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知幅度受限AWGN信道的最优输入是离散的且具有有限个支撑点，但关于支撑点数量K(A)随幅度约束A增加的紧致界限仍然是一个开放问题。

Method: 结合输出分布在总变差意义下收敛到均匀分布的特性，以及高斯混合近似的定量极限，推导了新的解析下界。

Result: 证明了K(A)随A的增长是超线性的，即支撑点数量的增长速度比线性更快。

Conclusion: 该研究为幅度受限AWGN信道最优输入分布的支撑点数量增长特性提供了新的理论下界，解决了这一长期开放问题。

Abstract: We study the growth of the support size of the capacity-achieving input
distribution for the amplitude-constrained additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel. While it is known since Smith (1971) that the optimal input is
discrete with finitely many mass points, tight bounds on the number of support
points $K(A)$ as the amplitude constraint $A$ increases remain open. Building
on recent work by Dytso \emph{et al.} (2019) and Mattingly \emph{et al.}
(2018), we derive a new analytical lower bound showing that $K(A)$ grows
super-linearly in $A$. Our approach combines total-variation convergence of the
output distribution to the uniform law with quantitative limits on Gaussian
mixture approximation.

Conclusion: 所提出的导频设计和估计方案能够有效处理MIMO-Zak-OTFS系统中的导频分离和干扰问题，实现高性能的信道估计和数据检测。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of spread pilot design and effective
channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output Zak-OTFS (MIMO-Zak-OTFS)
with superimposed spread pilots, where data and spread pilot signals are
superimposed in the same frame. To achieve good estimation performance in a
MIMO setting, the spread pilots at different transmit antennas need to be
effectively separated at the receiver. Towards this, we propose a spread pilot
design that separates the pilot sequences in the cross-ambiguity domain and
enables the estimation of the effective channel taps by a simple read-off
operation. To further alleviate the effect of pilot-data interference on
performance, we carry out turbo iterations between channel estimation and
detection. Simulation results for $2\times 2$ and $3\times 3$ MIMO-Zak-OTFS
with Gaussian-sinc pulse shaping filter for vehicular-A channel model show that
the proposed pilot design and estimation scheme with three turbo iterations can
achieve very good estimation/detection performance.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a pathway to restore communication for
individuals with severe motor or speech impairments. Imagined handwriting
provides an intuitive paradigm for character-level neural decoding, bridging
the gap between human intention and digital communication. While invasive
approaches such as electrocorticography (ECoG) achieve high accuracy, their
surgical risks limit widespread adoption. Non-invasive electroencephalography
(EEG) offers safer and more scalable alternatives but suffers from low
signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, constraining its decoding
precision. This work demonstrates that advanced machine learning combined with
informative EEG feature extraction can overcome these barriers, enabling
real-time, high-accuracy neural decoding on portable edge devices. A 32-channel
EEG dataset was collected from fifteen participants performing imagined
handwriting. Signals were preprocessed with bandpass filtering and artifact
subspace reconstruction, followed by extraction of 85 time-, frequency-, and
graphical-domain features. A hybrid architecture, EEdGeNet, integrates a
Temporal Convolutional Network with a multilayer perceptron trained on the
extracted features. When deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, the system achieved
89.83 percent accuracy with 914.18 ms per-character latency. Selecting only ten
key features reduced latency by 4.5 times to 202.6 ms with less than 1 percent
loss in accuracy. These results establish a pathway for accurate, low-latency,
and fully portable non-invasive BCIs supporting real-time communication.

Abstract: Accurate modulation classification is a core challenge in cognitive radio,
adaptive communications, spectrum analysis, and related domains, especially
under dynamic channels without transmitter knowledge. To address this need,
this article presents a labeled synthetic dataset designed for wireless
modulation classification under realistic propagation scenarios. The signals
were generated in MATLAB by modulating randomly generated bitstreams using five
digital modulation schemes: BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM. These
signals were then transmitted through Rayleigh and Rician fading channels with
standardized parameters, along with additional impairments to enhance realism
and diversity. Each modulated signal contains 1000 symbols. A comprehensive set
of features was extracted from the signals, encompassing statistical,
time-domain, frequency-domain, spectrogram-based, spectral correlation-based,
and image-processing-based descriptors such as BRISK, MSER, and GLCM. The
dataset is organized into 10 CSV files covering two channel types (Rayleigh and
Rician) across five sampling frequencies: 1 MHz, 10 MHz, 100 MHz, 500 MHz, and
1 GHz. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further experimentation, the
MATLAB scripts used for signal generation and feature extraction are also
provided. This dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for developing and
evaluating machine learning models in modulation classification, signal

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) on extreme edge devices represents a
stepping stone towards intelligent sensor nodes that preserve user privacy and
offer real-time predictions. Resource-constrained devices require efficient
TinyML algorithms that prolong the device lifetime of battery-operated devices
without compromising the classification accuracy. We introduce NanoHydra, a
TinyML TSC methodology relying on lightweight binary random convolutional
kernels to extract meaningful features from data streams. We demonstrate our
system on the ultra-low-power GAP9 microcontroller, exploiting its eight-core
cluster for the parallel execution of computationally intensive tasks. We
achieve a classification accuracy of up to 94.47% on ECG5000 dataset,
comparable with state-of-the-art works. Our efficient NanoHydra requires only
0.33 ms to accurately classify a 1-second long ECG signal. With a modest energy
consumption of 7.69 uJ per inference, 18x more efficient than the
state-of-the-art, NanoHydra is suitable for smart wearable devices, enabling a

TL;DR: 提出了一种多用户语义通信系统，同时执行任务执行和数据重建，通过互信息最大化来平衡这两个目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信系统主要专注于任务执行或数据重建，缺乏同时处理这两个目标的方案，特别是在多用户场景下。

Method: 将任务执行和数据重建的联合目标表示为凸组合，通过互信息最大化来优化，并证明SSIM损失可以从数据重建的互信息最大化目标中推导出来。

Result: 在资源使用恒定的情况下，增加重建目标的权重可以在保持任务执行性能几乎不变的同时，显著改善数据重建质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的语义通信系统能够有效平衡任务执行和数据重建，在多用户场景下实现更好的性能权衡。

Abstract: Semantic communication has gained significant attention with the advances in
machine learning. Most semantic communication works focus on either task
execution or data reconstruction, with some recent works combining the two. In
this work, we propose a semantic communication system for concurrent task
execution and data reconstruction for a multi-user scenario, which we formulate
as the maximization of mutual information. To investigate the trade-off between
the two objectives, we formulate a joint objective as a convex combination of
task execution and data reconstruction. We show that under specific
assumptions, the \ac{SSIM} loss can be obtained from the mutual information
maximization objective for data reconstruction, which takes human visual
perception into account. Furthermore, for constant resource use, we show that
by increasing the weight of the reconstruction objective up to a certain point,
the task execution performance can be kept nearly constant, while the data
reconstruction can be significantly improved.

TL;DR: 本文设计、实现并评估了一个基于RIS辅助的O-RAN 5G系统，在28GHz毫米波频段运行。通过1,024个单元的RIS实现了显著的信号增益，并开发了UE移动性管理算法来实时调整RIS和UE波束。


<details>

Motivation: 利用可重构智能表面(RIS)将电磁波重定向到期望方向，以增强信号覆盖和改善用户设备的信噪比，解决毫米波通信中的覆盖和移动性挑战。

Method: 设计32×32的1位RIS模块化架构，利用O-RAN E2接口动态控制RIS配置，开发两种UE移动性管理算法来联合跟踪和调整RIS与UE波束。

Result: 室内外场测显示RIS提供9-20dB和6-18dB的接收信号功率增益，移动性管理算法在实时操作中有效跟踪移动UE。

Conclusion: 研究证明了将RIS集成到O-RAN系统中的实际可行性，能够显著增强下一代蜂窝网络的覆盖、移动性支持和链路可靠性。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can redirect electromagnetic waves
to desired directions to enhance signal coverage and/or improve signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at the user equipment (UE). We present the design, implementation,
and evaluation of an RIS-assisted O-RAN 5G system operating in the FR2
millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band. We first introduce the design of 1,024
element (32 $\times$ 32) 1-bit RIS operating at the 28 GHz band, utilizing a
modular and scalable tiled architecture. Then we demonstrate how the O-RAN E2
interface can be leveraged to dynamically control RIS configurations without
modifying standard 5G signaling procedures. To evaluate the RIS-assisted 5G
system, we conducted extensive field trials in both indoor and outdoor
environments. The results of the O-RAN link coverage trials show that the
deployed RIS provides substantial received signal power gains, ranging from 9
to 20 dB and 6 to 18 dB in indoor and outdoors scenarios, respectively.
Handling UE mobility in RIS-assisted systems is challenging due to the need for
joint RIS and UE beam management. For that, we develop two UE mobility
management algorithms and evaluate them in real-time operation using the RIS
O-RAN testbed. These algorithms leverage the received signal power at the UE to
jointly track and adapt the RIS and UE beams in real time as the UE moves. The
findings draw important insights into the practical feasibility of integrating
RIS into O-RAN systems to enhance coverage, mobility support, and link
reliability in next-generation cellular networks.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对双功能雷达通信-正交时频空间系统的信号设计优化方法，通过交替优化框架联合优化导频符号设计和数据功率分配，显著提升了感知和通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正交时频空间技术在无线感知和通信系统中管理移动性方面具有显著优势，是双功能雷达通信的有前景候选方案，但目前尚未充分探索能够充分利用OTFS在DFRC中潜力的最优信号设计。

Method: 采用模糊函数的积分旁瓣水平作为雷达度量，同时考虑数据符号的随机性和确定性导频符号；推导了考虑OTFS信道估计误差的信道容量下界作为通信度量；通过加权和最大化感知和通信度量，使用交替优化框架解决优化问题。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了DFRC-OTFS系统中的信号设计优化问题，证明了通过联合优化导频和数据功率分配可以显著提升双功能系统的整体性能。

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) offers significant advantages in
managing mobility for both wireless sensing and communication systems, making
it a promising candidate for dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC).
However, the optimal signal design that fully exploits OTFS's potential in DFRC
has not been sufficiently explored. This paper addresses this gap by
formulating an optimization problem for signal design in DFRC-OTFS,
incorporating both pilot-symbol design for channel estimation and data-power
allocation. Specifically, we employ the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of the
ambiguity function as a radar metric, accounting for the randomness of the data
symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. For communication, we derive
a channel capacity lower bound metric that considers channel estimation errors
in OTFS. We maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication metrics and
solve the optimization problem via an alternating optimization framework.
Simulations indicate that the proposed signal significantly improves the
sensing-communication performance region compared with conventional signal
schemes, achieving at least a 9.44 dB gain in ISL suppression for sensing, and
a 4.82 dB gain in the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for
communication.

Abstract: Underwater data infrastructures offer natural cooling and enhanced physical
security compared to terrestrial facilities, but are susceptible to acoustic
injection attacks that can disrupt data integrity and availability. This work
presents a comprehensive surveillance framework for localizing and tracking
close-range adversarial acoustic sources targeting offshore infrastructures,
particularly underwater data centers (UDCs). We propose a heterogeneous
receiver configuration comprising a fixed hydrophone mounted on the facility
and a mobile hydrophone deployed on a dedicated surveillance robot. While using
enough arrays of static hydrophones covering large infrastructures is not
feasible in practice, off-the-shelf approaches based on time difference of
arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) filtering fail to
generalize for this dynamic configuration. To address this, we formulate a
Locus-Conditioned Maximum A-Posteriori (LC-MAP) scheme to generate acoustically
informed and geometrically consistent priors, ensuring a physically plausible
initial state for a joint TDOA-FDOA filtering. We integrate this into an
unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) pipeline, which provides reliable convergence
under nonlinearity and measurement noise. Extensive Monte Carlo analyses,
Gazebo-based physics simulations, and field trials demonstrate that the
proposed framework can reliably estimate the 3D position and velocity of an
adversarial acoustic attack source in real time. It achieves sub-meter
localization accuracy and over 90% success rates, with convergence times nearly
halved compared to baseline methods. Overall, this study establishes a
geometry-aware, real-time approach for acoustic threat localization, advancing
autonomous surveillance capabilities of underwater infrastructures.

Conclusion: 所提出的位置欺骗方案能有效提升感知安全性，在不了解窃听者特征或位置的情况下实现目标保护。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore sensing security in near-field (NF) integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios by exploiting known scatterers in
the sensing scene. We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers
are deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that
directed toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential
eavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as
targets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing
receiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this
deception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves'
characteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among
communication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and
power allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate
radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the
fractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to
solve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the
Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed.
Additionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between
targets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD
framework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical
perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can
flexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements,
thereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of
sensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal
strength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the
actual target.

Abstract: The cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) is a promising
technology for the six generation (6G) communication systems. Channel
prediction will play an important role in obtaining the accurate CSI to improve
the performance of CF-mMIMO systems. This paper studies a deep learning (DL)
based joint space-time-frequency domain channel prediction for CF-mMIMO.
Firstly, the prediction problems are formulated, which can output the
multi-step prediction results in parallel without error propagation. Then, a
novel channel prediction model is proposed, which adds frequency convolution
(FreqConv) and space convolution (SpaceConv) layers to Transformer-encoder. It
is able to utilize the space-time-frequency correlations and extract the space
correlation in the irregular AP deployment. Next, simulated datasets with
different sizes of service areas, UE velocities and scenarios are generated,
and correlation analysis and cross-validation are used to determine the optimal
hyper-parameters. According to the optimized hyper-parameters, the prediction
accuracy and computational complexity are evaluated based on simulated
datasets. It is indicated that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is
higher than traditional model, and its computational complexity is lower than
traditional Transformer model. After that, the impacts of space-time-frequency
correlations on prediction accuracy are studied. Finally, realistic datasets in
a high-speed train (HST) long-term evolution (LTE) network are collected to
verify the prediction accuracy. The verification results demonstrate that it
also achieves higher prediction accuracy compared with traditional models in
the HST LTE network.

Motivation: 6G网络对高速数据传输的需求推动了对更大链路规模、更低延迟和更高频谱效率的追求。VLC作为射频系统的补充，现有标准未能充分利用光链路的特性，且VLC链路上下行不对称，使得传统TDMA协议效率低下。

Method: 本文采用综述方法，回顾VLC和基于NOMA的VLC研究进展，分析关键优化约束和目标，调查适合NOMA的VLC场景，并指出未来研究方向。

Result: 研究发现NOMA技术允许多个用户共享相同的时间和频率资源，同时容忍受控干扰，特别适合VLC系统。VLC的强方向性和频繁视距传输特性可以缓解隐藏和暴露终端问题。

Conclusion: VLC特别是MAC层需要全新的设计，NOMA技术在6G VLC系统中具有广阔应用前景，未来需要在优化约束、场景适配等方面进行深入研究。

Abstract: Rapidly increasing demand for high speed data is pushing 6G wireless networks
to support larger link scales, lower latency, and higher spectral efficiency.
Visible light communications (VLC) is a strong complement to radio frequency
(RF) systems within 6G. The latest ITU G.9991 and IEEE 802.11bb standards are
adapted from cable and RF wireless technologies for use in VLC, so they do not
fully exploit the optical nature of light links. VLC links are often asymmetric
between uplink and downlink, which makes TDMA style protocols inefficient when
many users generate bursty and asymmetric traffic. Compared with RF, the strong
directionality and frequent line of sight in VLC can mitigate hidden and
exposed terminals, yet these effects can still appear under limited field of
view, blockage, or reflections. CSMA/CA and related methods remain usable in
VLC and in RF plus VLC networks, but they usually need design tweaks such as
RTS/CTS or directional sensing to perform well. Although the optical spectrum
is vast, the bandwidth of practical LEDs and of common PIN or APD receivers is
limited, so efficient multiple access can yield large gains. This motivates a
clean slate design for VLC, especially at the MAC layer. NOMA, first explored
in 5G RF systems, is also promising for 6G VLC. It lets multiple users share
the same time and frequency resources while tolerating controlled interference.
This paper reviews progress in VLC and in NOMA based VLC, outlines key
optimization constraints and objectives, surveys scenarios that fit NOMA in
VLC, and points to several directions for future work.

Conclusion: OTFS-IM是6G及未来网络的有前景技术，需要进一步研究解决复杂度、同步、安全等挑战，并探索与其他先进无线技术的集成。

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a two-dimensional modulation
technique that uses the delay-Doppler (DD) domain and is a candidate for
providing robust, high-capacity wireless communications for envisioned 6G and
beyond networks. The OTFS technique maps data to the DD domain instead of the
traditional time-frequency domain, enabling it to fully utilize channel
diversity and transform fast time-varying channels into nearly static channels.
Index modulation (IM) is a communication paradigm that conveys information not
only through conventional modulation symbols but also by encoding data bits in
the indices of the selected communication resources to improve error
performance, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency. In this survey, a
comprehensive review of work on OTFS-based wireless communication systems is
presented. In particular, the existing OTFS-IM schemes are reviewed and
systematically categorized according to their system architectures, detection
methods, and performance aspects such as capacity, peak-to-average power ratio,
diversity, complexity, imperfect channel state information, spectral
efficiency, and outage probability. Furthermore, the operating principles and
system models of OTFS-IM variants-including OTFS-based space shift keying,
OTFS-based spatial modulation, OTFS-based quadrature spatial modulation,
OTFS-based media-based modulation, and OTFS-based code index modulation-are
described, followed by a comparative performance analysis in terms of
computational complexity, error performance, capacity, energy saving, spectral
efficiency, and throughput. Finally, the challenges, benefits, and future
directions for OTFS-IM systems are discussed, covering key aspects such as
complexity, efficiency, latency, channel estimation, hardware constraints,
synchronization, security, and potential integration with other advanced
wireless communication techniques.

Conclusion: 提出的三阶段OMP-SBL算法能有效解决近场XL-MIMO系统中的信道估计和定位问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of channel estimation and 3D localization
algorithms in a challenging scenario, where a sub-connected planar extremely
large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communicates with
multi-antenna users. In the near field, the uplink MIMO channel is of full
column rank and therefore can not be estimated effectively by applying existing
codebooks that are designed for the far-field case or for the near-field case
but limited to single antenna users. To solve this problem, we propose a
three-stage algorithm aided by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and sparse
Bayesian learning (SBL). Specifically, we firstly partition the XL-MIMO into
subarrays and use OMP to solve the compressed sensing (CS) problem about
subarray channel estimation with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based
dictionary matrix. Secondly, exploiting the estimated subarray channels and
employing one-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC), we estimate
the central location of the user array under the Least Squares (LS) criterion.
Finally, we utilize the estimated central location to construct a refined
location-aided dictionary matrix and obtain the MIMO channel estimation using
SBL. Results exhibit the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm
compared with several benchmarks, in terms of both the pilot overhead and
estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Pixel-based reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) employ a novel design
to achieve high reflection gain at a lower hardware cost by eliminating the
phase shifters used in traditional RIS. However, this design presents
challenges for channel estimation and passive beamforming due to its
non-separable state response, rendering existing solutions ineffective. To
address this, we first approximate the non-separable RIS response functions
using a kernel-based method and a deep neural network, achieving high accuracy
while reducing computational and memory complexity. Next, we propose a
simplified cascaded channel model that focuses on dominated scattering paths
with limited unknown parameters, along with customized algorithms to estimate
short-term and long-term parameters separately. Finally, we introduce a
low-complexity passive beamforming algorithm to configure the discrete RIS
state vector, maximizing the achievable rate. Our simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly outperforms various

TL;DR: 该论文比较了两种工业M2M网络MAC协议：基于竞争窗口的BoP-MAC和基于分段的FROG-MAC，发现FROG-MAC在多优先级异构数据环境下在延迟和吞吐量方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业M2M网络中需要低延迟可靠通信，多优先级数据的存在增加了挑战。过去十年开发的众多MAC方案使得选择最有效解决方案变得困难，因此需要对主要MAC协议进行综合比较。

Method: 通过Contiki仿真平台，改变节点数量对两种协议（BoP-MAC和FROG-MAC）进行性能比较。BoP-MAC为多优先级流量分配差异化退避值，FROG-MAC通过分段低优先级流量实现高优先级包的早期传输。

Result: 在工业环境中处理多优先级异构数据时，FROG-MAC在延迟和吞吐量方面表现更好。

Conclusion: FROG-MAC协议在工业M2M网络的多优先级通信场景中具有更好的性能表现，特别是在延迟和吞吐量方面优于BoP-MAC。

Abstract: Efficient medium access control (MAC) is critical for enabling low-latency
and reliable communication in industrial Machine-to-Machine (M2M) net-works,
where timely data delivery is essential for seamless operation. The presence of
multi-priority data in high-risk industrial environments further adds to the
challenges. The development of tens of MAC schemes over the past decade often
makes it a tough choice to deploy the most efficient solu-tion. Therefore, a
comprehensive cross-comparison of major MAC protocols across a range of
performance parameters appears necessary to gain deeper insights into their
relative strengths and limitations. This paper presents a comparison of
Contention window-based MAC scheme BoP-MAC with a fragmentation based,
FROG-MAC; both protocols focus on reducing the delay for higher priority
traffic, while taking a diverse approach. BoP-MAC assigns a differentiated
back-off value to the multi-priority traffic, whereas FROG-MAC enables early
transmission of higher-priority packets by fragmenting lower-priority traffic.
Simulations were performed on Contiki by varying the number of nodes for two
traffic priorities. It has been shown that when work-ing with multi-priority
heterogenous data in the industrial environment, FROG-MAC results better both

Abstract: Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively
ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future
observations given past context. However, its direct computation for
high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable.
This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds
established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the
conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is
upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of
next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this
theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's
inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices.
  To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we
conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive
processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares
prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive
noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data
with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to
recover the known complexity ordering.
  This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series
complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models,
that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.

Abstract: This work is concerned with the coordination gain in integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems under a compress-and-estimate (CE) framework,
wherein inference performance is leveraged as the key metric. To enable
tractable transceiver design and resource optimization, we characterize
inference performance via an error probability bound as a monotonic function of
the discriminant gain (DG). This raises the natural question of whether
maximizing DG, rather than minimizing mean squared error (MSE), can yield
better inference performance. Closed-form solutions for DG-optimal and
MSE-optimal transceiver designs are derived, revealing water-filling-type
structures and explicit sensing and communication (S\&C) tradeoff. Numerical
experiments confirm that DG-optimal design achieves more power-efficient
transmission, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, by
selectively allocating power to informative features and thus saving transmit
power for sensing.

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) represent a novel approach to
programmable and affordable electromagnetic wave manipulation for enhanced
wireless communications, sensing, and imaging applications. Nevertheless,
current DMA designs and models are usually quasi-narrowband, neglecting the
versatile frequency-diverse manifestation and its utilization. This work
demonstrates the frequency-diversity and dispersion operations of a
representative DMA structure at the millimeter-wave band. We demonstrate
flexible dispersion manipulation through dynamic holographic reconfigurability
of the meta-atoms in a DMA. This effect can create distinct radiation patterns
across the operating frequency band, achieving flexible frequency diversity
with enhanced scanning range within a compact, reconfigurable platform. It
eliminates the need for wideband systems or complex phase-shifting networks
while offering an alternative to frequency-scanned static beams of traditional
leaky-wave antennas. The results establish fundamental insights into modelling
and utilization of dispersive effects of DMAs in next-generation near-field and
far-field holographic sensing and computational holographic imaging
applications.

Conclusion: A-MMMSE算法通过避免矩阵求逆和利用GPU加速，为延迟敏感的下行多用户MIMO系统提供了一种高效解决方案

Abstract: Precoding design based on weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization is a
fundamental problem in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) systems. While the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)
algorithm is a standard solution, its high computational complexity--cubic in
the number of base station antennas due to matrix inversions--hinders its
application in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this limitation, we
propose a highly parallel algorithm based on a block coordinate descent
framework. Our key innovation lies in updating the precoding matrix via block
coordinate gradient descent, which avoids matrix inversions and relies solely
on matrix multiplications, making it exceptionally amenable to GPU
acceleration. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary
point of the WSR maximization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage
warm-start strategy grounded in the sum mean-square error (MSE) minimization
problem to accelerate convergence. We refer to our method as the Accelerated
Mixed weighted-unweighted sum-MSE minimization (A-MMMSE) algorithm. Simulation
results demonstrate that A-MMMSE matches the WSR performance of both
conventional WMMSE and its enhanced variant, reduced-WMMSE, while achieving a
substantial reduction in computational time across diverse system
configurations.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks have shown strategic superiority in
maritime communications, assisting in establishing signal transmissions from
shore to ship through space-based links. Traditional performance modeling based
on multiple circular orbits is challenging to characterize large-scale LEO
satellite constellations, thus requiring a tractable approach to accurately
evaluate the network performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical
framework for an LEO satellite-aided shore-to-ship communication network
(LEO-SSCN), where LEO satellites are distributed as a binomial point process
(BPP) on a specific spherical surface. The framework aims to obtain the
end-to-end transmission performance by considering signal transmissions through
either a marine link or a space link subject to Rician or Shadowed Rician
fading, respectively. Due to the indeterminate position of the serving
satellite, accurately modeling the distance from the serving satellite to the
destination ship becomes intractable. To address this issue, we propose a
distance approximation approach. Then, by approximation and incorporating a
threshold-based communication scheme, we leverage stochastic geometry to derive
analytical expressions of end-to-end transmission success probability and
average transmission rate capacity. Extensive numerical results verify the
accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the effect of key parameters on the
performance of LEO-SSCN.
