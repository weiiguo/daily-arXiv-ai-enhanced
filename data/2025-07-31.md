### [1] [Dynamic Exponent Market Maker: Personalized Portfolio Manager and One Pool to Trade Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22732)
*Wittawat Kositwattanarerk*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种新型AMM协议，允许流动性提供者自由存入代币，动态调整比例，减少交易费用，但需防范闪电贷攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有去中心化交易所（如Uniswap和Balancer）中流动性提供需固定比例代币及交易需跨池的问题。

Method: 设计动态不变函数的AMM协议，支持自由存入代币并保持比例，通过单一复合池执行交易。

Result: 协议能减少交易费用，但存在闪电贷攻击风险。

Conclusion: 新型AMM协议优化了流动性提供和交易效率，但需结合防范措施以保障安全。

Abstract: Decentralized exchange platforms such as Uniswap and Balancer operate on
several pools where each pool contains two or more cryptocurrencies and
constitutes direct trading pairs. The drawbacks here are that liquidity
providing requires contribution of tokens in a specific proportion, and trading
may require hopping between pools, hence increasing transaction fee and gas
fee. We propose an automated market maker (AMM) protocol where liquidity
providers can deposit any amount of tokens into the pool. The protocol will
preserve the proportion of tokens by total value at the time of deposit and can
be seen as a personalized self-balancing portfolio manager. In addition, since
the invariant function is dynamic, all exchange pairs are executed from a
single composite pool. Nevertheless, the scheme is vulnerable to flash loan
attacks and must be used in conjunction with preventive measures.

### [2] [Age of Estimates: When to Submit Jobs to a Markov Machine to Maximize Revenue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22865)
*Sahan Liyanaarachchi,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种最大化马尔可夫机器（MM）效用的方法，通过优化作业提交时间以增加平均收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI工厂时代的到来，有效跟踪和利用计算资源变得至关重要。现有研究多关注跟踪MM状态，而忽略了优化其利用。

Method: 假设泊松作业到达过程和基于查询的采样方法，找到提交作业的最佳时间以最大化单位作业的平均收益。

Result: 根据MM参数，最优策略表现为基于状态估计年龄的阈值策略或切换策略。

Conclusion: 优化作业提交时间可显著提高MM的效用，为计算资源管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the dawn of AI factories ushering a new era of computing supremacy,
development of strategies to effectively track and utilize the available
computing resources is garnering utmost importance. These computing resources
are often modeled as Markov sources, which oscillate between free and busy
states, depending on their internal load and external utilization, and are
commonly referred to as Markov machines (MMs). Most of the prior work solely
focuses on the problem of tracking these MMs, while often assuming a
rudimentary decision process that governs their utilization. Our key
observation is that the ultimate goal of tracking a MM is to properly utilize
it. In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the utility of a MM,
where the utility is defined as the average revenue generated by the MM.
Assuming a Poisson job arrival process and a query-based sampling procedure to
sample the state of the MM, we find the optimal times to submit the available
jobs to the MM so as to maximize the average revenue generated per unit job. We
show that, depending on the parameters of the MM, the optimal policy is in the
form of either a \emph{threshold policy} or a \emph{switching policy} based on
the \emph{age of our estimate} of the state of the MM.

### [3] [Efficient handover based on Near-field and Far-field RIS for seamless connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22141)
*Atiquzzaman Mondal,Waheeb Tashan,Ayat Al-Olaimat,Hüseyin Arslan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可重构智能表面（RIS）的高效切换管理方案，用于6G网络，通过优化移动管理和减少信令开销来提升覆盖和连接性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可重构智能表面（RIS）是6G通信网络中的一项变革性技术，能够智能操控电磁波以增强覆盖和连接性。本文旨在利用RIS在菲涅耳区域（近场和远场）优化切换管理。

Method: 分析了RIS辅助网络中信号强度的变化，推导了近场区域RIS-UE距离的概率密度函数（PDF），并提出了一种新的切换算法，结合了硬切换（HHO）、软切换（SHO）、RIS辅助小区呼吸（RIS-CB）和RIS辅助乒乓避免（RIS-PP）策略。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法显著降低了切换率和信令负载，提升了频谱效率（SE）和能量效率（EE），确保了6G系统中的无缝连接和服务质量（QoS）。

Conclusion: 提出的RIS辅助切换管理方案在6G网络中具有显著优势，能够优化移动管理并提升网络性能。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is becoming a transformative
technology for the upcoming 6G communication networks, providing a way for
smartly maneuvering the electromagnetic waves to enhance coverage and
connectivity. This paper presents an efficient handover (HO) management scheme
leveraging RIS in the Fresnel region i.e., in both the near-field (NF) and
far-field (FF) regions to reduce signaling overhead and optimize mobility
management. For this, we analyzed the signal strength variations in the
considered RIS-aided networks, considering the radiative NF and FF regions, and
derive the probability density function (PDF) of the RIS-UE distance in the NF
region to quantify RIS reflection gains along the user equipment (UE)
trajectory. We propose a new HO algorithm incorporating several HO categories
like hard handover (HHO), soft handover (SHO), RIS-aided cell breathing
(RIS-CB), and RIS-aided ping-pong avoidance (RIS-PP) strategies. The proposed
algorithm uses bit error rate (BER) as a key parameter to predict the
minimization of unnecessary HOs by using RIS-aided pathways to retain
connectivity with the serving base station (BS), which minimizes the
requirement for frequent target BS searching and ultimately optimizes the HO.
By restricting measurement reports and HO requests, the suggested method
improves spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), especially in
crowded cellular networks. Numerical results highlight significant reductions
in HO rates and signaling load, ensuring seamless connectivity and improved
quality of service (QoS) in 6G systems.

### [4] [Deep Learning for Gradient and BCG Artifacts Removal in EEG During Simultaneous fMRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22263)
*K. A. Shahriar,E. H. Bhuiyan,Q. Luo,M. E. H. Chowdhury,X. J. Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的去噪自编码器（DAR）方法，用于去除EEG-fMRI同步记录中的MR相关伪影，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-fMRI同步记录的高时空分辨率受到MR伪影（如梯度伪影和心电伪影）的干扰，限制了其应用。

Method: 使用1D卷积自编码器从噪声信号到清晰信号直接学习映射，利用CWL EEG-fMRI数据集中的配对数据。

Result: DAR的RMSE为0.0218±0.0152，SSIM为0.8885±0.0913，SNR增益为14.63 dB，显著优于传统方法（p<0.001）。

Conclusion: DAR是一种高效且可解释的实时EEG伪影去除方法，适用于EEG-fMRI同步记录。

Abstract: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution
for tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by
artifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and
ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To
address this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning
framework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using
paired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from
the CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a
direct mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional
artifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent
component analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet
thresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared
error (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of
0.8885 $\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB.
Statistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are
significant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO)
cross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an
average RMSE of 0.0635 $\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\pm$ 0.0880 across
unseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that
DAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to
interpret. Overall, these results position DAR as a potential and
understandable solution for real-time EEG artifact removal in simultaneous
EEG-fMRI applications.

### [5] [Robust Filtering and Learning in State-Space Models: Skewness and Heavy Tails Via Asymmetric Laplace Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22343)

Method: 采用非对称拉普拉斯分布建模噪声，提出变分贝叶斯算法和单循环参数估计策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在各种噪声条件下表现鲁棒，无需手动调参，且计算资源消耗更低。

Conclusion: 该方法在鲁棒控制和金融建模等领域具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle
with outlier data that deviates from Gaussian distributions, frequently
exhibiting skewness and heavy tails. This paper introduces a robust extension
utilizing the asymmetric Laplace distribution, specifically tailored to capture
these complex characteristics. We propose an efficient variational Bayes
algorithm and a novel single-loop parameter estimation strategy, significantly
enhancing the efficiency of the filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation
processes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our methods provide
consistently robust performance across various noise settings without the need
for manual hyperparameter adjustments. In stark contrast, existing models
generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual
tuning. Moreover, our approach uses far fewer computational resources, thereby
validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for
practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.

### [6] [Green One-Bit Quantized Precoding in Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22400)
*Salih Gümüsbuğa,Ozan Alp Topal,Özlem Tuğfe Demir*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型量化预编码算法，用于无小区大规模MIMO系统，通过动态关闭不必要的天线提高能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 仿真显示算法在性能和功耗上优于现有方法（如SQUID和RZF）。

Conclusion: 该算法有效平衡了性能和能效，适用于未来6G通信。

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one
of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless
communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user
equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of
antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains
associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To
address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to
balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this
work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free
massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates
unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby
enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm
outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford
splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior
performance while effectively reducing power consumption.

Method: 结合PINN和GNN，PINN引入电磁传播规律的物理约束，GNN建模接收器位置的空间相关性，参数化多径信号为功率、延迟和到达角。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在稀疏采样条件下仍能高精度构建RF地图，在室内外环境中均表现优异，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理约束和空间相关性建模，显著提升了RF地图的构建精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) map is a promising technique for capturing the
characteristics of multipath signal propagation, offering critical support for
channel modeling, coverage analysis, and beamforming in wireless communication
networks. This paper proposes a novel RF map construction method based on a
combination of physics-informed neural network (PINN) and graph neural network
(GNN). The PINN incorporates physical constraints derived from electromagnetic
propagation laws to guide the learning process, while the GNN models spatial
correlations among receiver locations. By parameterizing multipath signals into
received power, delay, and angle of arrival (AoA), and integrating both
physical priors and spatial dependencies, the proposed method achieves accurate
prediction of multipath parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the
method enables high-precision RF map construction under sparse sampling
conditions and delivers robust performance in both indoor and complex outdoor
environments, outperforming baseline methods in terms of generalization and
accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法在低成本下实现了准确的雷达基人类运动方向确定，并开源了代码。

Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague.
The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus
determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information
for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map
(DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature
augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost
but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is
explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first
generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking
model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast
Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset.
The open-source code of this work is released at:

### [9] [Fundamental Limits of Rigid Body Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22573)
*Niclas Führling,Ivan Alexander Morales Sandoval,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,Gonzalo Seco-Granados,David González G.,Osvaldo Gonsa*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法来制定刚性体定位（RBL）问题的Cramér-Rao下界（CRLB），通过信息中心的Fisher信息矩阵（FIM）构造，评估平移和旋转估计的基本精度限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要适用于点目标，而刚性体定位涉及平移和旋转矩阵的估计，需要更通用的CRLB框架。

Method: 采用信息中心的FIM构造方法，捕捉每种测量对FIM的贡献，推导出适用于任何刚性体定位场景的通用CRLB框架。

Result: 给出了所有CRLB的闭式表达式，包括旋转矩阵正交约束的边界。数值结果表明，该表达式正确下界了现有最优算法的估计误差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有RBL算法的精度限制，表明仍有改进空间。

Abstract: We consider a novel approach to formulate the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB)
for the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, which allows us to assess the
fundamental accuracy limits on the estimation of the translation and rotation
of a rigid body with respect to a known reference. To that end, we adopt an
information-centric construction of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which
allows to capture the contribution of each measurement towards the FIM, both in
terms of input measurement types, as well as of their error distributions.
Taking advantage of this approach, we derive a generic framework for the CRLB
formulation, which is applicable to any type of rigid body localization
scenario, extending the conventional FIM formulation suitable for point targets
to the case of a rigid body whose location include both translation vector and
the rotation matrix (or alternative the rotation angles), with respect to a
reference. Closed-form expressions for all CRLBs are given, including the bound
incorporating an orthonormality constraint onto the rotation matrix. Numerical
results illustrate that the derived expression correctly lower-bounds the
errors of estimated localization parameters obtained via various related
state-of-the-art (SotA) estimators, revealing their accuracies and suggesting
that SotA RBL algorithms can still be improved.

### [11] [A Multi-Scale Spatial Attention Network for Near-field MIMO Channel Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22656)
*Zhiming Zhu,Shu Xu,Jiexin Zhang,Chunguo Li,Yongming Huang,Luxi Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于空间注意力的深度学习方法（MsSAN），用于解决极大规模阵列（ELAA）近场信道估计问题，通过多尺度架构和创新的空间注意力机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极大规模阵列（ELAA）虽然提高了频谱效率和空间自由度，但近场信道估计问题突出，现有方法对变换矩阵选择和停止条件敏感。

Method: 分析了近场信道的空间天线相关性，提出多尺度空间注意力网络（MsSAN），利用子信道间相关性学习能力，并引入点积和作为空间注意力机制。

Result: 仿真结果表明，MsSAN在近场信道重建中表现出色，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MsSAN通过创新的空间注意力和多尺度架构，有效解决了近场信道估计问题。

Abstract: The deployment of extremely large-scale array (ELAA) brings higher spectral
efficiency and spatial degree of freedom, but triggers issues on near-field
channel estimation.
  Existing near-field channel estimation schemes primarily exploit sparsity in
the transform domain.
  However, these schemes are sensitive to the transform matrix selection and
the stopping criteria.
  Inspired by the success of deep learning (DL) in far-field channel
estimation, this paper proposes a novel spatial-attention-based method for
reconstructing extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) channel.
  Initially, the spatial antenna correlations of near-field channels are
analyzed as an expectation over the angle-distance space, which demonstrate
correlation range of an antenna element varies with its position.
  Due to the strong correlation between adjacent antenna elements, interactions
of inter-subchannel are applied to describe inherent correlation of near-field
channels instead of inter-element.
  Subsequently, a multi-scale spatial attention network (MsSAN) with the
inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities is proposed tailed to
near-field MIMO channel estimation.
  We employ the multi-scale architecture to refine the subchannel size in
MsSAN.
  Specially, we inventively introduce the sum of dot products as spatial
attention (SA) instead of cross-covariance to weight subchannel features at
different scales in the SA module.
  Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed MsSAN achieves
remarkable the inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities and
outperforms others in terms of near-field channel reconstruction.

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的二维块稀疏感知方法在近场宽带信道估计中优于传统极域方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为太赫兹通信系统中的宽带近场信道获取提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the channel acquisition problem for a wideband terahertz (THz)
communication system, where an extremely large-scale array is deployed to
mitigate severe path attenuation. In channel modeling, we account for both the
near-field spherical wavefront and the wideband beam-splitting phenomena,
resulting in a wideband near-field channel. We propose a frequency-independent
orthogonal dictionary that generalizes the standard discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) matrix by introducing an additional parameter to capture the near-field
property. This dictionary enables the wideband near-field channel to be
efficiently represented with a two-dimensional (2D) block-sparse structure.
Leveraging this specific sparse structure, the wideband near-field channel
estimation problem can be effectively addressed within a customized compressive
sensing framework. Numerical results demonstrate the significant advantages of
our proposed 2D block-sparsity-aware method over conventional
polar-domain-based approaches for near-field wideband channel estimation.
