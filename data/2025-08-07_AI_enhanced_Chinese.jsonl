To ensure traceability and\naccountability, embedding unique identifiers within printed objects is\nessential, in order to assist forensic investigation of illicit use. This paper\nmodels data embedding in 3D printing using principles from error-correcting\ncodes, aiming to recover embedded information from partial or altered fragments\nof the object. Previous works embedded one-dimensional data (i.e., a vector)\ninside the object, and required almost all fragments of the object for\nsuccessful decoding. In this work, we study a problem setting in which only one\nsufficiently large fragment of the object is available for decoding. We first\nshow that for one-dimensional embedded information the problem can be easily\nsolved using existing tools. Then, we introduce novel encoding schemes for\ntwo-dimensional information (i.e., a matrix), and three-dimensional information\n(i.e., a cube) which enable the information to be decoded from any sufficiently\nlarge rectangle-shaped or cuboid-shaped fragment. Lastly, we introduce a code\nthat is also capable of correcting bit-flip errors, using techniques from\nrecently proposed codes for DNA storage.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel error-correcting coding framework specifically tailored for\nmatrix multiplication operations. Our proposed framework is designed to detect\nand correct multiple computational errors that may arise during the execution\nof matrix products. By leveraging a grid-based structural encoding scheme, our\napproach enhances error localization and correction capabilities across all\nparticipating matrices, thereby significantly improving the fault tolerance of\nthe computation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves\ndeterministic correction of up to two erroneous symbols distributed across\nthree matrices with 100\\% reliability, while incurring only a 24\\% overhead in\ncomputational time on GPU architectures. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous\ntheoretical analysis of the error-correction properties inherent to our coding\nscheme, establishing its correctness and robustness under well-defined fault\nmodels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u9ed8\u6570\u636e\u635f\u574f\uff08SDC\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u9759\u9ed8\u6570\u636e\u635f\u574f\uff08SDC\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e14\u4f1a\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd100%\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7ea0\u6b63\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u591a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u589e\u52a024%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, these technological\nadvancements lead to significant near-field effects, while the implementation\nof M-MIMO \\mbox{is associated with considerable} hardware costs and escalated\npower consumption. In this context, hybrid architecture designs emerge as both\nhardware-efficient and energy-efficient solutions. Motivated by these\nconsiderations, we investigate the design of energy-efficient hybrid\nbeamfocusing for near-field ISAC under two distinct target scenarios, i.e., a\npoint target and an extended target. Specifically, we first derive the\nclosed-form Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) of joint angle-and-distance estimation\nfor the point target and the Bayesian CRB (BCRB) of the target response matrix\nfor the extended target. Building on these derived results, we minimize the\nCRB/BCRB by optimizing the transmit beamfocusing, while ensuring the energy\nefficiency (EE) of the system and the quality-of-service (QoS) for\ncommunication users. To address the resulting \\mbox{nonconvex problems}, we\nfirst utilize a penalty-based successive convex approximation technique with a\nfully-digital beamformer to obtain a suboptimal solution. Then, we propose an\nefficient alternating \\mbox{optimization} algorithm to design the\nanalog-and-digital beamformer. \\mbox{Simulation} results indicate that joint\ndistance-and-angle estimation is feasible in the near-field region. However,\nthe adopted hybrid architectures inevitably degrade the accuracy of distance\nestimation, compared with their fully-digital counterparts.

The optimal waveform is derived in closed\nform using the function and Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions, and the solution is\nexplicitly expressed with respect to the dual variables.

To efficiently solve the derived QP problems, we develop an improved\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm by integrating a\nlinear-time projection technique, which significantly enhances the\ncomputational efficiency.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a channel-aware\ndiscrete semantic coding framework tailored for low-power edge networks.\nLeveraging a Wasserstein-regularized objective, our approach aligns discrete\ncode activations with optimal input distributions, thereby improving semantic\nfidelity, robustness, and task accuracy. Extensive experiments on the inference\ntasks across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes show that our method\nachieves notable gains in accuracy and communication efficiency.

Existing research on FAS primarily\nfocuses on line-of-sight (LoS) communication scenarios, and neglects the\nsituations where only NLoS links exist. To address the issues posted by NLoS\ncommunication, we design an FAR-assisted communication system combined with\namplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. In order to alleviate the high energy\nconsumption introduced by AF protocol while ensuring communication quality, we\nformulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. By optimizing the\npositions of the fluid antennas (FAs) on both sides of the FAR, we achieve\ncontrollable phase shifts of the signals transmitting through the blockage\nwhich causes the NLoS link. Besides, we establish a channel model that jointly\nconsiders the blockage-through matrix, large-scale fading, and small-scale\nfading. To maximize the EE of the system, we jointly optimize the FAR position,\nFA positions, power control, and beamforming design under given constraints,\nand propose an iterative algorithm to solve this formulated optimization\nproblem.
