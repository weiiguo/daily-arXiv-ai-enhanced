### [1] [Exponential convergence rate for Iterative Markovian Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02770)
*Kirill Sokolov,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文首次证明了IMF算法在离散时间Schrödinger桥问题中具有指数收敛性，并给出了明确的收缩因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已知IMF算法在Kullback-Leibler散度下收敛于真实解，但其收敛速度尚未量化。

Method: 通过分析离散时间Schrödinger桥问题，研究IMF算法的收敛性。

Result: 首次证明了IMF算法具有指数收敛性，并给出了明确的收缩因子。

Conclusion: IMF算法在离散时间Schrödinger桥问题中具有高效的收敛性能。

Abstract: We consider the discrete-time Schr\"odinger bridge problem on a finite state
space. Although it has been known that the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF)
algorithm converges in Kullback-Leibler divergence to the ground truth
solution, the speed of that convergence remained unquantified. In this work, we
establish for the first time that IMF exhibits exponential convergence with an
explicit contraction factor.

### [2] [Distributed Source Coding for Compressing Vector-Linear Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02996)

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受移动卫星通信系统和计算任务应用的启发，研究如何高效压缩向量线性函数。

Method: 提出通用下界，并针对特定模型（3源3编码器）分类矩阵T，通过上下界方法精确表征容量。

Result: 发现下界并非总是紧的，但对大多数模型有效；解决了网络函数计算中的开放问题。

Conclusion: 论文为向量线性函数压缩提供了理论支持，并解决了相关开放问题。

Abstract: Inspired by mobile satellite communication systems and the important and
prevalent applications of computational tasks, we consider a distributed source
coding model for compressing vector-linear functions, which consists of
multiple sources, multiple encoders and a decoder linked to all the encoders.
Each encoder has access to a certain subset of the sources and the decoder is
required to compute with zero error a vector-linear function of the source
information, which corresponds to a matrix $T$. The connectivity state between
the sources and the encoders and the vector-linear function are all arbitrary.
In the paper, we are interested in the function-compression capacity to measure
the efficiency of using the system. We first present a general lower bound on
the function-compression capacity applicable to arbitrary connectivity states
and vector-linear functions. Next, we confine to the nontrivial models with
only three sources and no more than three encoders, and prove that all the
$3\times2$ column-full-rank matrices $T$ can be divided into two types $T_1$
and $T_2$, for which the function-compression capacities are identical if the
matrices $T$ have the same type. We explicitly characterize the
function-compression capacities for two most nontrivial models associated with
$T_2$ by a novel approach of both upper bounding and lower bounding the size of
image sets of encoding functions. This shows that the lower bound thus obtained
is not always tight. Rather, by completely characterizing their capacities, the
lower bound is tight for all the models associated with $T_1$ and all the
models associated with $T_2$ except for the two most nontrivial models. We
finally apply the obtained results to network function computation and answer
the open problem whether the best known upper bound proved by Guang et. al.
(2019) on computing capacity is in general asymptotically tight.

### [3] [Multilevel inserting constructions for constant dimension subspace codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03196)
*Gang Wang,Xuan Gao,Sihem Mesnager,Fang-Wei Fu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于逆双边多级构造的恒定维度子空间码（CDC）构建方法，通过引入逆双边识别向量和逆双边Ferrers图秩度量码，改进了现有CDC的构造效率，并展示了比现有文献更大的码集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恒定维度子空间码（CDC）在随机网络编码中有广泛应用，但现有构造方法效率有限，需要更高效的构建方式。

Method: 提出逆双边多级构造，结合逆双边识别向量和Ferrers图秩度量码，嵌入到双多级构造和双边多级构造中，同时提供新的双边识别向量集。

Result: 构建了多个比现有文献更大的CDC码集，新下界与已知上界的比值大于0.94548（对任意素数幂q≥3）。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了CDC的构造效率，为网络编码中的实际应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Subspace codes, especially constant dimension subspace codes (CDCs),
represent an intriguing domain that can be used to conduct basic coding theory
investigations. They have received widespread attention due to their
applications in random network coding. This paper presents inverse bilateral
multilevel construction by introducing inverse bilateral identifying vectors
and inverse bilateral Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes. By inserting the
inverse bilateral multilevel construction into the double multilevel
construction and bilateral multilevel construction, an effective construction
for CDCs is provided. Furthermore, via providing a new set of bilateral
identifying vectors, we give another efficient construction for CDCs. In this
article, several CDCs are exhibited, equipped with the rank-metric, with larger
sizes than the known ones in the existing literature. From a practical
standpoint, our results could help in the pragmatic framework of
constant-dimension-lifted rank-metric codes for applications in network coding.
The ratio of the new lower bound to the known upper bound for some CDCs is
calculated, which is greater than 0.94548 for any prime power $q \geq 3.$

### [4] [Channel Coding for Unequal Error Protection in Digital Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03381)
*Seonjung Kim,Yongjeong Oh,Yongjune Kim,Namyoon Lee,Yo-Seb Jeon*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新型信道编码框架，用于数字语义通信中的不等错误保护（UEP），通过优化比特级和块级保护策略，显著提升任务性能和传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数字语义通信中比特级语义重要性不等的问题，确保高重要性比特得到更强保护。

Method: 1. 基于重复编码的比特级UEP框架；2. 利用现代信道码的块级UEP框架，结合比特分组算法。

Result: 仿真实验显示，所提框架在图像传输任务中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的UEP框架有效提升了语义通信的性能和效率，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Semantic communication is an emerging paradigm that prioritizes transmitting
task-relevant information over accurately delivering raw data bits. In this
paper, we address an unequal error protection (UEP) problem in digital semantic
communication, where bits of higher semantic importance require stronger
protection. To quantify bit-level importance, we leverage bit-flip
probabilities of semantic bits as target error protection levels, which are
jointly learned with semantic encoder and decoder. We propose two novel channel
coding frameworks aimed at minimizing the total blocklength while satisfying
UEP constraints. First, we develop a bit-level UEP framework based on
repetition coding, in which the repetition number for each bit is optimized to
precisely meet its target bit-flip probability. Second, we introduce a
block-level UEP framework utilizing modern channel codes, where semantic bits
with similar target bit-flip probabilities are grouped to exploit coding gains.
Within this framework, we propose a bit-grouping algorithm guided by finite
blocklength capacity analysis. Simulation results conducted on image
transmission tasks confirm that the proposed frameworks significantly
outperform conventional approaches, yielding substantial improvements in both
task performance and transmission efficiency.

### [5] [Dual Domain Expurgated Error Exponents for Source Coding with Side Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03467)
*Mehdi Dabirnia,Hamdi Joudeh,Albert Guillén i Fàbregas*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于带边信息的源编码的净化方法，通过双域推导直接得到净化误差指数。双域方法优化参数少，且允许一般字母表和/或记忆。推导了两种净化误差指数，并展示了数值示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过双域方法简化优化问题，避免对分布的直接优化，同时支持更一般的编码场景。

Method: 采用双域推导方法，优化少量参数，推导出两种净化误差指数。

Result: 展示了两种指数的差异，并在无边信息情况下与源最优码的误差指数一致。

Conclusion: 双域方法在简化优化的同时，保持了灵活性和有效性，适用于多种编码场景。

Abstract: We introduce an expurgation method for source coding with side information
that enables direct dual-domain derivations of expurgated error exponents.
Dual-domain methods yield optimization problems over few parameters, with any
sub-optimal choice resulting in an achievable exponent, as opposed to
primal-domain optimization over distributions. In addition, dual-domain methods
naturally allow for general alphabets and/or memory. We derive two such
expurgated error exponents for different random-coding ensembles. We show the
better of the exponents coincides with the Csisz\'ar-K\"orner exponent obtained
via a graph decomposition lemma. We show some numerical examples that
illustrate the differences between the two exponents and show that in the case
of source coding without side information, the expurgated exponent coincides
with the error exponent of the source optimal code.

### [6] [Decoding Algorithms for Twisted GRS Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03552)
*Guanghui Zhang,Liren Lin,Bocong Chen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于高斯消元法的解码算法，用于MDS和近MDS的TGRS码，能纠正特定数量的错误，计算复杂度为O(n³)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展GRS码的代数能力，构造新的非GRS MDS码并提升密码学安全性。

Method: 采用高斯消元法设计解码算法，适用于MDS和近MDS TGRS码。

Result: 算法能纠正特定数量的错误，计算复杂度为O(n³)。

Conclusion: 新方法填补了现有文献的空白，适用于更广泛的TGRS码解码场景。

Abstract: Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes were introduced to extend the
algebraic capabilities of classical generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes. This
extension holds the potential for constructing new non-GRS maximum distance
separable (MDS) codes and enhancing cryptographic security. It is known that
TGRS codes with $1$ twist can either be MDS or near-MDS. In this paper, we
employ the Gaussian elimination method to propose new decoding algorithms for
MDS TGRS codes with parameters $[n,k,n-k+1]$. The algorithms can correct up to
$\lfloor \frac{n-k}{2}\rfloor$ errors when $n-k$ is odd, and $\lfloor
\frac{n-k}{2}\rfloor-1$ errors when $n-k$ is even. The computational complexity
for both scenarios is $O(n^3)$. %, where $\omega\approx 2.37286$ is the matrix
multiplication exponent. Our approach diverges from existing methods based on
Euclidean algorithm and addresses situations that have not been considered in
the existing literature \cite{SYJL}. Furthermore, this method is also
applicable to decoding near-MDS TGRS codes with parameters $[n, k, n-k]$,
enabling correction of up to $\lfloor \frac{n-k-1}{2} \rfloor$ errors, while
maintaining polynomial time complexity in $n$.

### [7] [What If, But Privately: Private Counterfactual Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03681)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种保护用户隐私的反事实解释检索框架，通过信息论隐私保护技术，确保用户特征向量和不可变特征集的隐私，同时减少数据库信息的泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中使用黑盒机器学习模型时，透明性和可解释性至关重要。反事实解释是一种满足需求的方法，但可能威胁用户和机构的隐私。本文关注用户在检索反事实实例时的隐私保护。

Method: 1. 提出私有反事实检索（PCR）问题及基线方案；2. 提出两种减少数据库信息泄露的方案；3. 扩展至不可变PCR（I-PCR），保护不可变特征集；4. 结合用户偏好生成更可行的解释。

Result: 理论分析和数值结果表明，所提方案在保护用户隐私的同时，有效减少了数据库信息的泄露。

Conclusion: 论文提出的框架在保护用户隐私和减少数据库泄露方面取得了平衡，为反事实解释的隐私保护提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two important aspects to be considered
when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications.
Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement.
However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of the institution that is
providing the explanation, as well as the user who is requesting it. In this
work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve
a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the
institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual
explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect,
information-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of
private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that
keeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the
institution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the
amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,
compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability
of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the
user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of
their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their
feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we
propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,
but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and
I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their
attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we
present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the
database leakage of the proposed schemes.

### [8] [An AI-driven EDA Algorithm-Empowered VCO and LDO Co-Design Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02687)
*Yijia Hao,Maarten Strackx,Miguel Gandara,Sandy Cochran,Bo Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种AI驱动的EDA算法，用于LDO供电的LC-tank VCO的协同设计，优化了高频和低频相位噪声的权衡，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统设计方法未能充分解决高频和LDO引起的低频相位噪声之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用AI驱动的EDA算法进行协同设计，设计了一个5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO与集成LDO。

Result: 相位噪声在1 MHz偏移处改善了1.2 dB，动态功耗降低了28.8%，FoM提升了2.4 dBc/Hz。

Conclusion: 协同设计方法显著优于传统顺序设计方法，验证了AI驱动EDA算法的有效性。

Abstract: Traditionally, the output noise and power supply rejection of low-dropout
regulators (LDOs) are optimized to minimize power supply fluctuations, reducing
their impact on the low-frequency noise of target voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs). However, this sequential design approach does not fully
address the trade-offs between high-frequency and LDO-induced low-frequency
phase noise. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a co-design
method for low phase-noise LC-tank VCOs powered by LDOs. It is difficult to
carry out the co-design using traditional manual design techniques. Hence, an
efficient AI-driven EDA algorithm is used. To validate the proposed method, a
5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO with an integrated LDO is designed using a 65 nm CMOS
process. Simulations show that the co-design method improves phase noise by 1.2
dB at a 1 MHz offset and reduces dynamic power consumption by 28.8%, with FoM
increased by 2.4 dBc/Hz compared to the conventional sequential design method.

### [9] [On Improving PPG-Based Sleep Staging: A Pilot Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02689)
*Jiawei Wang,Yu Guan,Chen Chen,Ligang Zhou,Laurence T. Yang,Sai Gu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过双流交叉注意力架构结合PPG及其辅助信息提升睡眠分期性能的方法，实验表明该方法在MESA数据集上表现显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG传感器在消费设备中广泛应用，但单独使用PPG实现可靠的睡眠分期仍具挑战性。

Method: 比较单流模型与双流交叉注意力策略，结合PPG及其衍生模态（如增强PPG或合成ECG）学习互补信息。

Result: 在MESA数据集上，双流交叉注意力架构结合PPG及其辅助信息显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 双流交叉注意力架构结合PPG及其辅助信息是提升睡眠分期性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Sleep monitoring through accessible wearable technology is crucial to
improving well-being in ubiquitous computing. Although
photoplethysmography(PPG) sensors are widely adopted in consumer devices,
achieving consistently reliable sleep staging using PPG alone remains a
non-trivial challenge. In this work, we explore multiple strategies to enhance
the performance of PPG-based sleep staging. Specifically, we compare
conventional single-stream model with dual-stream cross-attention strategies,
based on which complementary information can be learned via PPG and PPG-derived
modalities such as augmented PPG or synthetic ECG. To study the effectiveness
of the aforementioned approaches in four-stage sleep monitoring task, we
conducted experiments on the world's largest sleep staging dataset, i.e., the
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis(MESA). We found that substantial
performance gain can be achieved by combining PPG and its auxiliary information
under the dual-stream cross-attention architecture. Source code of this project

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ASTARS辅助的联邦学习（FL）上行链路模型传输，通过OTA计算技术减少参数上传数量，提升学习效率和信号传输质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用ASTARS缓解多径衰落并重塑电磁环境，以提升FL上行链路的模型传输效率。

Method: 结合OTA计算技术，优化接收波束分配和ASTARS相位偏移，以减少模型聚合误差。

Result: ASTARS辅助的FL系统在离散数据集上表现更优，且使用更少的激活单元即可达到更高精度。

Conclusion: ASTARS显著提升FL精度，但需平衡放大功率以避免热噪声成为主要误差源。

Abstract: Active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surfaces (ASTARS) have
attracted growing research interest due to its ability to alleviate
multiplicative fading and reshape the electromagnetic environment across the
entire space. In this paper, we utilise ASTARS to assist the federated learning
(FL) uplink model transfer and further reduce the number of uploaded parameter
counts through over-the-air (OTA) computing techniques. The impact of model
aggregation errors on ASTARS-aided FL uplink networks is characterized. We
derive an upper bound on the aggregation error of the OTA-FL model and quantify
the training loss due to communication errors. Then, we define the performance
of OTA-FL as a joint optimization problem that encompasses both the assignment
of received beams and the phase shifting of ASTARS, aiming to achieve the
maximum learning efficiency and high-quality signal transmission. Numerical
results demonstrate that: i) The FL accuracy in ASTARS uplink networks are
enhanced compared to that in state-of-the-art networks; ii) The ASTARS enabled
FL system achieves the better learning accuracy using fewer active units than
other baseline, especially when the dataset is more discrete; and iii) FL
accuracy improves with higher amplification power, but excessive amplification
makes thermal noise the dominant source of error.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于二阶统计量的盲信道估计方法普遍存在复数标量模糊问题，通常需要依赖导频或参考符号来解决。本文旨在提出一种无需导频的盲解决方法。

Method: 采用频域线性非冗余预编码和交替子载波星座分裂技术，设计了一种盲估计算法。

Result: 通过MATLAB仿真验证，所提算法在M进制PAM系统中的性能与半盲方法相当。

Conclusion: 该算法成功解决了复数标量模糊问题，且性能与半盲方法相当，为盲信道估计提供了一种有效方案。

Abstract: The problem of second-order statistics (SOS)-based blind channel estimation
in OFDM systems is addressed in this paper. Almost all SOS-based methods
proposed so far suffer from a complex-scalar estimation ambiguity, which is
resolved by using pilots or reference symbols. We propose an algorithm to
resolve this ambiguity in blind manner using frequency-domain linear
non-redundant precoding and constellation-splitting among the alternate
subcarriers. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via numerical
simulations in MATLAB environment. Simulation results show that the proposed
approach performs as good as its semi-blind counterpart for M-ary PAM systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为跨领域科学发现提供了有力工具，但需注意外部因素导致的虚假依赖关系。

Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary
tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit
complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a
priori knowledge regarding the nature of dependence. We introduce a
self-supervised approach, concurrence, which is inspired by the observation
that if two signals are dependent, then one should be able to distinguish
between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them.
Experiments with fMRI, physiological and behavioral signals show that, to our
knowledge, concurrence is the first approach that can expose relationships
across such a wide spectrum of signals and extract scientifically relevant
differences without ad-hoc parameter tuning or reliance on a priori
information, providing a potent tool for scientific discoveries across fields.
However, depencencies caused by extraneous factors remain an open problem, thus
researchers should validate that exposed relationships truely pertain to the
question(s) of interest.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的去噪框架，结合能量模型和Fisher分数正则化，用于降低传感器数据噪声并保持物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工程系统中的传感器数据常因噪声和难以解释而限制了其在控制和诊断中的实用性。

Method: 提出了一种物理信息去噪框架，结合能量模型和Fisher分数正则化，并在基准问题和实际LPBF实验数据上验证。

Result: 该方法在多种噪声水平和LPBF处理条件下优于基线神经网络去噪器。

Conclusion: 该物理引导的去噪策略能够实时解释低成本传感器数据，有助于增材制造中的预测控制和缺陷缓解。

Abstract: Modern engineering systems are increasingly equipped with sensors for
real-time monitoring and decision-making. However, the data collected by these
sensors is often noisy and difficult to interpret, limiting its utility for
control and diagnostics. In this work, we propose a physics-informed denoising
framework that integrates energy-based model and Fisher score regularization to
jointly reduce data noise and enforce physical consistency with a physics-based
model. The approach is first validated on benchmark problems, including the
simple harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation, and Laplace's equation, across
varying noise levels. We then apply the denoising framework to real thermal
emission data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing
experiments, using a trained Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) surrogate
model of the LPBF process to guide denoising. Results show that the proposed
method outperforms baseline neural network denoisers, effectively reducing
noise under a range of LPBF processing conditions. This physics-guided
denoising strategy enables robust, real-time interpretation of low-cost sensor
data, facilitating predictive control and improved defect mitigation in
additive manufacturing.

*Pengxu Lin,An-An Lu,Xiqi Gao*

TL;DR: 利用辛优化设计用户中心网络（UCN）大规模MIMO系统的预编码器，避免传统线性预编码中的矩阵求逆，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在UCN大规模MIMO系统中，传统线性预编码的矩阵求逆计算复杂度高，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 将接收模型转换到实数域，基于耗散哈密顿动力学系统框架，通过辛优化设计预编码器。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在计算效率和性能上优于传统的WMMSE预编码器。

Conclusion: 辛优化方法为UCN大规模MIMO系统提供了一种高效且性能优越的预编码器设计解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize symplectic optimization to design a precoder for
user-centric network (UCN) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems, where a subset of base stations (BSs) serves each user terminal (UT)
instead of using all BSs. In UCN massive MIMO systems, the dimension of the
precoders is reduced compared to conventional network massive MIMO. It
simplifies the implementation of precoders in practical systems. However, the
matrix inversion in traditional linear precoders still requires high
computational complexity. To avoid the matrix inversion, we employ the
symplectic optimization framework, where optimization problems are solved based
on dissipative Hamiltonian dynamical systems. To better fit symplectic
optimization, we transform the received model into the real field and
reformulate the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem. The objective
function of the optimization problem is viewed as the potential energy of the
dynamical system. Due to energy dissipation, the continuous dynamical system
always converges to a state with minimal potential energy. By discretizing the
continuous system while preserving the symplectic structure, we obtain an
iterative method for the precoder design. The complexity analysis of the
proposed symplectic method is also provided to show its high computational
efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed precoder design
based on symplectic optimization outperforms the weighted minimum mean-square
error (WMMSE) precoder in the UCN massive MIMO system.

Conclusion: SleepLiteCNN是可穿戴设备中睡眠呼吸暂停亚型检测的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by breathing interruptions
lasting at least ten seconds and occurring more than five times per hour.
Accurate, high-temporal-resolution detection of sleep apnea subtypes -
Obstructive, Central, and Mixed - is crucial for effective treatment and
management. This paper presents an energy-efficient method for classifying
these subtypes using a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with high temporal
resolution to address the real-time needs of wearable devices. We evaluate a
wide range of classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning
architectures on 1-second ECG windows, comparing their accuracy, complexity,
and energy consumption. Based on this analysis, we introduce SleepLiteCNN, a
compact and energy-efficient convolutional neural network specifically designed
for wearable platforms. SleepLiteCNN achieves over 95% accuracy and a 92%
macro-F1 score, while requiring just 1.8 microjoules per inference after 8-bit
quantization. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis further

Motivation: 城市空气污染是导致数百万人过早死亡的主要健康危机，迫切需要准确且可扩展的空气质量监测方法。低成本传感器虽然具有可扩展性，但受漂移、校准误差和环境干扰影响。

Method: Veli利用变分推理构建低成本传感器读数的解耦表示，分离真实污染物读数与传感器噪声。同时，引入了AQ-SDR，最大的AQ传感器基准数据集。

Result: Veli在分布内和分布外设置中表现出强大的泛化能力，有效处理传感器漂移和异常行为。

Conclusion: Veli为低成本传感器提供了一种无需参考站的校正方法，显著提升了空气质量监测的可行性和准确性。

Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature
deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable
monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable
alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected
by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these
challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent
Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference
to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,
eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a
disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the
true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address
the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air
Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor
benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across
multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor
drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made
public when this paper is published.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SpectrumFM的频谱基础模型，通过创新的频谱编码器和自监督学习任务提升频谱认知的泛化能力和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有频谱认知方法在多样化的频谱环境和任务中泛化能力有限且准确性不足，需要一种新的解决方案。

Result: 在频谱感知、异常检测和无线技术分类任务中表现优异，检测概率提升30%，AUC提升10%，准确率提升9.6%。

Conclusion: SpectrumFM为频谱认知提供了新的范式，显著提升了性能和适应性。

Abstract: The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum
utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing
spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal
accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed
SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative
spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the
multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both
fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the
spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning
tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are
developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and
transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly
adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum
sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification
(WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over
state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in
the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under
the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.

Conclusion: 证明了使用标准Wi-Fi硬件实现高精度传感的可行性，无需修改或专用全双工能力。

Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, a method to extract both range and
Doppler information from commercial Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) using
a monostatic (single transceiver) setup. Utilizing the CSI phase in Wi-Fi
sensing from a Network Interface Card (NIC) not designed for full-duplex
operation is challenging due to (1) Hardware asynchronization, which introduces
significant phase errors, and (2) Proximity of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx)
antennas, which creates strong coupling that overwhelms the motion signal of
interest. We propose a new signal processing approach that addresses both
challenges via three key innovations: Time offset cancellation, Phase alignment
correction, and Tx/Rx coupling mitigation. Our method achieves cm-level
accuracy in range and Doppler estimation for moving targets, validated using a
commercial Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC. Our results show successful detection and
tracking of moving objects in realistic environments, establishing the
feasibility of high-precision sensing using standard Wi-Fi packet
communications and off-the-shelf hardware without requiring any modification or
specialized full-duplex capabilities.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态监测框架，结合声发射传感和同轴相机视觉，用于激光定向能量沉积（DED）增材制造中的熔池动态和几何变化识别，分类准确率达94.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DED制造中熔池动态和工艺变化导致零件质量不稳定，现有研究多关注缺陷检测，但缺乏对熔池动态和工艺质量的验证。

Method: 集成接触式声发射传感和同轴相机视觉，预处理数据后提取特征，评估多种机器学习算法（SVM、随机森林、XGBoost）以分类几何变化。

Result: 多模态策略分类性能达94.4%，优于单独使用声发射（87.8%）或相机（86.7%）。

Conclusion: 系统能有效捕捉几何变化相关的振动和形态特征，为未来研究零件变化（如几何误差和制造缺陷）奠定技术基础。

Abstract: Laser directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing struggles with
consistent part quality due to complex melt pool dynamics and process
variations. While much research targets defect detection, little work has
validated process monitoring systems for evaluating melt pool dynamics and
process quality. This study presents a novel multimodal monitoring framework,
synergistically integrating contact-based acoustic emission (AE) sensing with
coaxial camera vision to enable layer-wise identification and evaluation of
geometric variations in DED parts. The experimental study used three part
configurations: a baseline part without holes, a part with a 3mm diameter
through-hole, and one with a 5mm through-hole to test the system's discerning
capabilities. Raw sensor data was preprocessed: acoustic signals were filtered
for time-domain and frequency-domain feature extraction, while camera data
underwent melt pool segmentation and morphological feature extraction. Multiple
machine learning algorithms (including SVM, random forest, and XGBoost) were
evaluated to find the optimal model for classifying layer-wise geometric
variations. The integrated multimodal strategy achieved a superior
classification performance of 94.4%, compared to 87.8% for AE only and 86.7%
for the camera only. Validation confirmed the integrated system effectively
captures both structural vibration signatures and surface morphological changes
tied to the geometric variations. While this study focuses on specific
geometries, the demonstrated capability to discriminate between features
establishes a technical foundation for future applications in characterizing
part variations like geometric inaccuracies and manufacturing-induced defects.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems face increasing susceptibility
to advanced beam-stealing attacks, posing a significant physical layer security
threat. This paper introduces a novel framework employing an advanced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for proactive and adaptive defense against
these sophisticated attacks. A key innovation is leveraging Integrated Sensing

assessment. The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious
activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that
guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to
overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a
security-critical task. Consequently, the agent learns a robust and adaptive
policy that intelligently balances security and communication performance.
Numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves a mean attacker
detection rate of 92.8% while maintaining an average user SINR of over 13 dB.

### [22] [Zak-OTFS for Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling in the Presence of Mobility & Delay Spread](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02950)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Zak-OTFS调制的超Nyquist信号传输方案，通过叠加信息符号并利用慢变信道特性，简化接收处理并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交信号传输（Nyquist）限制了带宽和时间内的信息符号数量，超Nyquist信号传输通过叠加符号突破这一限制，但需解决正交性损失问题。

Method: 利用Zak-OTFS调制在延迟-多普勒域叠加信息符号，保持原始间隔，并通过预编码器缓解信道干扰，同时使用互不偏置基简化接收处理。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方案在未编码时性能与Nyquist信号相当，编码后在高信噪比下性能更优。

Conclusion: 提出的超Nyquist方案通过Zak-OTFS调制和互不偏置基叠加，有效提升了信号传输效率与性能。

Abstract: Orthogonal signaling limits the number of information symbols transmitted in
bandwidth $B$ and time $T$ to be $BT$. This corresponds to the Nyquist
signaling and is achieved by mounting information symbols on $BT$-dimensional
basis spanning the $BT$-dimensional space spaced $\frac{1}{B}$ and
$\frac{1}{T}$ apart. Faster-than-Nyquist signaling involves transmitting more
than $BT$ informational symbols in a $BT$-dimensional space. This leads to loss
of orthogonality. This is achieved by time and/or bandwidth expansion resulting
from packing more information symbols in the same $BT$-dimensional space
(spacing less than $\frac{1}{B}$ and/or $\frac{1}{T}$). In this paper, we take
a different approach to faster-than-Nyquist signaling. We propose to
superimpose the information symbols on one another maintaining the original
spacing in the Nyquist signaling. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler (DD)
domain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS)
modulation. In Zak-OTFS, the channel varies slowly. Further Zak-OTFS also
allows construction of mutually unbiased bases the interference between which
appear like Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme leverages the slow variation in
the DD channel to construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the
doubly-spread channel. Further, in the proposed scheme we mount information
symbols on two mutually unbiased bases which allows superposition of
information symbols. This simplifies receiver processing to detection in
Gaussian noise since each basis appears to the other as Gaussian noise. This
reduction makes it possible to use trellis coded modulation to enhance
bit-error performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the
faster-than-Nyquist signaling scheme achieves similar uncoded performance as
that of Nyquist signaling and with coding the performance is better than
Nyquist signaling at high signal-to-noise ratios.

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization underpins applications ranging from wayfinding
and emergency response to asset tracking and smart-building services.
Radio-frequency solutions (e.g. Wi-Fi, RFID, UWB) are widely adopted but remain
vulnerable to multipath fading, interference, and uncontrollable coverage
variation. We explore an orthogonal modality -- visible light communication
(VLC) -- and demonstrate that the spectral signatures captured by a low-cost
AS7341 sensor can serve as robust location fingerprints.
  We introduce a two-stage framework that (i) trains a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) on real spectral measurements and (ii) enlarges the training corpus with
synthetic samples produced by TabGAN. The augmented dataset reduces the mean
localization error from 62.9cm to 49.3cm -- a 20% improvement -- while
requiring only 5% additional data-collection effort. Experimental results
obtained on 42 reference points in a U-shaped laboratory confirm that GAN-based
augmentation mitigates data-scarcity issues and enhances generalization.

Conclusion: MELA架构为ELAA的实际部署提供了高效且前瞻性的解决方案。

Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) have emerged as a pivotal
technology for addressing the unprecedented performance demands of
next-generation wireless communication systems. To enhance their practicality,
we propose metasurface-enabled extremely large-scale antenna (MELA) systems --
novel transceiver architectures that employ reconfigurable transmissive
metasurfaces to facilitate efficient over-the-air RF-to-antenna coupling and
phase control. This architecture eliminates the need for bulky switch matrices
and costly phase-shifter networks typically required in conventional solutions.
Physically grounded models are developed to characterize electromagnetic field
propagation through individual transmissive unit cells, capturing the
fundamental physics of wave transformation and transmission. Additionally,
distance-dependent approximate models are introduced, exhibiting structural
properties conducive to efficient parameter estimation and signal processing.
Based on the channel model, a two stage channel estimation framework is
proposed for the scenarios comprising users in the hybrid near- and far-fields.
In the first stage, a dictionary-driven beamspace filtering technique enables
rapid angular-domain scanning. In the refinement stage, the rotational symmetry
of subarrays is exploited to design super-resolution estimators that jointly
recover angular and range parameters. An analytical expression for the
half-power beamwidth of MELA is derived, revealing its near-optimal spatial
resolution relative to conventional ELAA architectures. Numerical experiments
further validate the high-resolution of the proposed channel estimation
algorithm and the fidelity of the electromagnetic model, positioning the MELA
architecture as a highly competitive and forward-looking solution for practical
ELAA deployment.

Abstract: Wireless localization has become a promising technology for offering
intelligent location-based services. Although its localization accuracy is
improved under specific scenarios, the short of environmental dynamic
vulnerability still hinders this approach from being fully practical
applications. In this paper, we propose CSSLoc, a novel framework on
contrastive self-supervised pre-training to learn generic representations for
accurate localization in various scenarios. Without the location information
supervision, CSSLoc attempts to learn an insightful metric on the similarity
discrimination of radio data, in such a scenario-agnostic manner that the
similar samples are closely clustered together and different samples are
separated in the representation space. Furthermore, the trained feature encoder
can be directly transferred for downstream localization tasks, and the location
predictor is trained to estimate accurate locations with the robustness of
environmental dynamics. With extensive experimental results, CSSLoc can
outperform classical and state-of-the-art DNN-based localization schemes in
typical indoor scenarios, pushing deep-learning-based localization from
specificity to generality.

Conclusion: LLMaterial展示了直接从雷达信号进行开放集材料识别的潜力。

Abstract: Accurately identifying the material composition of objects is a critical
capability for AI robots powered by large language models (LLMs) to perform
context-aware manipulation. Radar technologies offer a promising sensing
modality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar
technologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of
various objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained
to closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data
collection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical
applicability. This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful
reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material
composition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due
to the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs
have no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we
introduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using
LLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a
physics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar
raw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the
material's intrinsic characteristics. Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters.
Leveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step
reasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material
recognition directly from raw radar signals. Preliminary results show that
LLMaterial can effectively distinguish among a variety of common materials,
highlighting its strong potential for real-world material identification
applications.

Result: 通过三个代表性数值测试案例验证了HODMD方法的计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: HODMD方法在计算效率和准确性上优于传统DMD，适用于大规模电路仿真。

Abstract: Model order reduction (MOR) has long been a mainstream strategy to accelerate
large-scale transient circuit simulation. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)
represents a novel data-driven characterization method, extracting dominant
dynamical modes directly from time-domain simulation data without requiring
explicit system equations. This paper first deduces the DMD algorithm and then
proposes high order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD) incorporating delayed
embedding technique, specifically targeting computational efficiency in
large-scale circuit simulations. Compared with the DMD method, the HODMD method
overcomes the problem that the output signal cannot be reconstructed when the
spatial resolution is insufficient. The proposed HODMD algorithm is applicable
to general circuits and does not impose any constraints on the topology of the
pertinent circuit or type of the components. Three representative numerical
test cases are presented to systematically validate both the computational
efficiency and accuracy of the proposed HODMD method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in semantic communication have primarily focused on image
transmission, where neural network (NN)-based joint source-channel coding
(JSCC) modules play a central role. However, such systems often experience
semantic communication errors due to mismatched knowledge bases between users
and performance degradation from outdated models, necessitating regular model
updates. To address these challenges in vector quantization (VQ)-based image
semantic communication systems, we propose FedSFR, a novel federated learning
(FL) framework that incorporates semantic feature reconstruction (FR). FedSFR
introduces an FR step at the parameter server (PS) and allows a subset of
clients to transmit compact feature vectors in lieu of sending full local model
updates, thereby improving training stability and communication efficiency. To
enable effective FR learning, we design a loss function tailored for VQ-based
image semantic communication and demonstrate its validity as a surrogate for
image reconstruction error. Additionally, we provide a rigorous convergence
analysis and present a differentially private variant of FedSFR, along with
formal privacy analysis. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets
validate the superiority of FedSFR over existing baselines, especially in
capacity-constrained settings, confirming both its effectiveness and
robustness.

Method: 在模拟驾驶环境中测试了8对LED和2对白炽灯刹车灯设计，记录22名受试者的EEG数据，分析P3成分的反应时间。

Result: 白炽灯刹车灯的认知反应时间显著慢于所有测试的LED刹车灯；LED设计间差异不显著。

Conclusion: LED刹车灯设计在提高驾驶员反应速度方面优于白炽灯，但LED设计间的差异需进一步研究以减少EEG信号中的运动伪影。

Abstract: Half of all road accidents result from either lack of driver attention or
from maintaining insufficient separation between vehicles. Collision from the
rear, in particular, has been identified as the most common class of accident
in the UK, and its influencing factors have been widely studied for many years.
Rear-mounted stop lamps, illuminated when braking, are the primary mechanism to
alert following drivers to the need to reduce speed or brake. This paper
develops a novel brain response approach to measuring subject reaction to
different brake light designs. A variety of off-the-shelf brake light
assemblies are tested in a physical simulated driving environment to assess the
cognitive reaction times of 22 subjects. Eight pairs of LED-based and two pairs
of incandescent bulb-based brake light assemblies are used and
electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded. Channel Pz is utilised to extract the
P3 component evoked during the decision making process that occurs in the brain
when a participant decides to lift their foot from the accelerator and depress
the brake. EEG analysis shows that both incandescent bulb-based lights are
statistically slower to evoke cognitive responses than all tested LED-based
lights. Between the LED designs, differences are evident, but not statistically
significant, attributed to the significant amount of movement artifact in the
EEG signal.

Abstract: This work presents a new spiking neural network (SNN)-based approach for user
equipment-base station (UE-BS) association in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs).
With the introduction of UAV's in wireless networks, the system architecture
becomes heterogeneous, resulting in the need for dynamic and efficient
management to avoid congestion and sustain overall performance. The presented
framework compares two SNN-based optimization strategies. Specifically, a
top-down centralized approach with complete network visibility and a bottom-up
distributed approach for individual network nodes. The SNN is based on leak
integrate-and-fire neurons with temporal components, which can perform fast and
efficient event-driven inference. Realistic ray-tracing simulations are
conducted, which showcase that the bottom-up model attains over 90\% accuracy,
while the top-down model maintains 80-100\% accuracy. Both approaches reveal a
trade-off between individually optimal solutions and UE-BS association
feasibility, thus revealing the effectiveness of both approaches depending on
deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Increasing demand for massive device connectivity in underserved regions
drives the development of advanced low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite
communication systems. Beam-hopping LEO systems without connection
establishment provide a promising solution for achieving both demand-aware
resource allocation and low access latency. This paper investigates
beam-hopping pattern design for the grant-free random access systems to
dynamically allocate satellite resources according to traffic demands across
serving cells. We formulate a binary optimization problem that aims to maximize
the minimum successful transmission probability across cells, given limited
satellite beam generation capacity. To solve this problem, we propose novel
beam-hopping design algorithms that alternately enhance the collision avoidance
rate and decoding success probability within an alternating optimization
framework. Specifically, the algorithms employ a bisection method to optimize
illumination allocation for each cell based on demand, while using the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to optimize beam-hopping
patterns for maximizing decoding success probability. Furthermore, we enhance
the ADMM by replacing the strict binary constraint with two equivalent
continuous-valued constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed algorithms compared to other beam-hopping methods and verify
robustness in managing traffic demand imbalance.

Abstract: This paper studies a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(CF-mMIMO) proactive monitoring system in which multiple multi-antenna
monitoring nodes (MNs) are assigned to either observe the transmissions from an
untrusted transmitter (UT) or to jam the reception at the untrusted receiver
(UR). We propose an effective channel state information (CSI) acquisition
scheme for the monitoring system. In our approach, the MNs leverage the pilot
signals transmitted during the uplink and downlink phases of the untrusted link
and estimate the effective channels corresponding to the UT and UR via a
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation scheme. We derive new spectral
efficiency (SE) expressions for the untrusted link and the monitoring system.
For the latter, the SE is derived for two CSI availability cases at the central
processing unit (CPU); namely case-1: imperfect CSI knowledge at both MNs and
CPU, case-2: imperfect CSI knowledge at the MNs and no CSI knowledge at the
CPU. To improve the monitoring performance, we propose a novel joint mode
assignment and jamming power control optimization method to maximize the
monitoring success probability (MSP) based on the Bayesian optimization
framework. Numerical results show that (a) our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring
system relying on the proposed CSI acquisition and optimization approach
significantly outperforms the considered benchmarks; (b) the MSP performance of
our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring system is greater than 0.8, regardless of the
number of antennas at the untrusted nodes or the precoding scheme for the
untrusted transmission link.

Abstract: This paper studies integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with dynamic
time division duplex (DTDD) cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input
multiple-output~(mMIMO) systems. DTDD enables the CF mMIMO system to
concurrently serve both uplink~(UL) and downlink~(DL) users with spatially
separated \emph{half-duplex~(HD)} access points~(APs) using the same
time-frequency resources. Further, to facilitate ISAC, the UL APs are utilized
for both UL data and target echo reception, while the DL APs jointly transmit
the precoded DL data streams and target signal. In this context, we present
centralized and distributed generalized likelihood-ratio tests~(GLRTs) for
target detection treating UL users' signals as sensing interference. We then
quantify the optimality and complexity trade-off between distributed and
centralized GLRTs and benchmark the respective estimators with the Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for target radar-cross section~(RCS). Then, we present
a unified framework for joint UL users' data detection and RCS estimation.
Next, for communication, we derive the signal-to-noise-plus-interference~(SINR)
optimal combiner accounting for the cross-link and radar interference for UL
data processing. In DL, we use regularized zero-forcing for the users and
propose two types of precoders for the target: one ``user-centric" that
nullifies the interference caused by the target signal to the DL users and one
``target-centric" based on the dominant eigenvector of the composite channel
between the target and the APs. Finally, numerical studies corroborate with our
theoretical findings and reveal that the \emph{GLRT is robust to inter-AP
interference, and DTDD doubles the $90\%$-likely sum UL-DL SE compared to
traditional TDD-based CF-mMIMO ISAC systems}; while using HD hardware.

Abstract: Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of
Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture,
hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental
pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which
defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated
organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there
exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice
using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the
communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding
of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome
communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome
communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a
multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is
conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological
signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart
agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of
agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed.
These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things
enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and
eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges,
open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are
discussed.
