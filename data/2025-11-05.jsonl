To mitigate the severe path loss\ninherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming\narchitectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral\nefficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO\nsystems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed\nobservations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and\nfar-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high\ncarrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing\nbased frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot\nfaithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures,\nleading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a\ndiffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a\ndiffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid\nspherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach,\nit leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM\nperforms inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the\nnumber of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method.\nExperimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance,\nattaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art\nschemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced\ncomputational efficiency."}

Both assumptions limit the performance of a control\nsystem, as not having a preview signal prevents proactive grade compensation,\nwhereas relying only on map data potentially subjects the control system to\nmissing or outdated information. These limits can be avoided by measuring the\noncoming grade in real-time using on-board lidar sensors. In this work, we use\npoint returns accumulated during travel to estimate the grade at each waypoint\nalong a path.

PID decomposes the contribution of\ndifferent inputs to an output into unique information from each input,\nredundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges\nfrom combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons\nin classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the\ninformation in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between\nthe external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and\nunique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and\nperformance drops steeply.

Finally, the identification with the\nleast Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most\nplausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better\nperformed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information\napplications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring."}

Specifically, impulsive interference presents a\nsignificant challenge to channel estimation due to its sporadic, unpredictable,\nand high-power nature. To tackle this issue, we develop a Bayesian channel\nestimation technique based on variational inference (VI) that leverages the\nsparsity of the mmWave channel in the angular domain and the intermittent\nnature of impulsive interference to minimize channel estimation errors. The\nproposed technique employs mean-field approximation to approximate posterior\ninference and integrates VI into the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms\nbaselines in terms of channel estimation accuracy."}

However, practical realization faces significant\nchallenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems\nand performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite\nblocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users\nwhile tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in\nboth communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to\nminimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via\nalternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results\nshow that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from\nfewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow\nmotion to degrade sensing. A \"sweet spot\" arises where blocklength and\nbeamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum\nin radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance,\nachieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly."}

In such scenarios, developing\neffective interference suppression schemes is necessary to improve overall\nsystem performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel user\nequipment-centric interference suppression scheme, which effectively detects\ninter-cell interference (ICI) and subsequently applies interference whitening\nto mitigate ICI. The proposed scheme, named Z-refined deep support vector data\ndescription, exploits a one-class classification-based anomaly detection\ntechnique. Numerical results verify that the proposed scheme outperforms\nvarious baselines in terms of interference detection performance with limited\ntime or frequency resources for training and is comparable to the performance\nbased on an ideal genie-aided interference suppression scheme.

Specifically, we assume that the transmission of\neach bit takes a single time slot, and the Markov chain updates its state in\nthe same time slot. Thus, the length of the codeword assigned to a symbol\ndetermines the number of non-transmitted symbols, as well as, the probability\nof the realization of the next symbol to be transmitted. We aim to minimize the\naverage transmission duration over an infinite horizon by proposing an optimal\nsource coding policy based on the last transmitted symbol and its transmission\nduration. To find the optimal policy, we formulate the problem with a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) by augmenting the symbols alongside the transmission\nduration of the symbols. Finally, we analyze two Huffman-based benchmark\npolicies and compare their performances with the proposed optimal policy. We\nobserve that, in randomly generated processes, our proposed optimal policy\ndecreases the average transmission duration compared to benchmark policies. The\nperformance gain varies based on the parameters of the Markov process."}
