Networking", "summary": "Age of Information (AoI) is emerging as a novel metric for measuring\ninformation freshness in real-time monitoring systems. For\ncomputation-intensive status data, the information is not revealed until being\nprocessed. We consider a status update problem in a multi-source single-server\nsystem where the sources are scheduled to generate and transmit status data\nwhich are received and processed at the edge server. Generate-at-will sources\nwith both random transmission time and process time are considered, introducing\nthe joint optimization of source scheduling and status sampling on the basis of\ntransmission-computation balancing. We show that a random scheduler is optimal\nfor both non-preemptive and preemptive server settings, and the optimal sampler\ndepends on the scheduling result and its structure remains consistent with the\nsingle-source system, i.e., threshold-based sampler for non-preemptive case and\ntransmission-aware deterministic sampler for preemptive case. Then, the problem\ncan be transformed to jointly optimizing the scheduling frequencies and the\nsampling thresholds/functions, which is non-convex. We proposed an alternation\noptimization algorithm to solve it. Numerical experiments show that the\nproposed algorithm can achieve the optimal in a wide range of settings."}

A set of $q$-ary\nsequences of length $n$ is referred to as an\n\\emph{$(n,q,N;\\mathcal{B})$-reconstruction code} if each sequence\n$\\boldsymbol{x}$ within this set can be uniquely reconstructed from any $N$\ndistinct elements within its error ball $\\mathcal{B}(\\boldsymbol{x})$. The main\nobjective in this area is to determine or establish bounds for the minimum\nredundancy of $(n,q,N;\\mathcal{B})$-reconstruction codes, denoted by\n$\\rho(n,q,N;\\mathcal{B})$. In this paper, we investigate reconstruction codes\nwhere the error ball is either the \\emph{$t$-deletion ball}\n$\\mathcal{D}_t(\\cdot)$ or the \\emph{$t$-insertion ball} $\\mathcal{I}_t(\\cdot)$.\nFirstly, we establish a fundamental connection between reconstruction codes for\ndeletions and insertions. For any positive integers $n,t,q,N$, any\n$(n,q,N;\\mathcal{I}_t)$-reconstruction code is also an\n$(n,q,N;\\mathcal{D}_t)$-reconstruction code. This leads to the inequality\n$\\rho(n,q,N;\\mathcal{D}_t)\\leq \\rho(n,q,N;\\mathcal{I}_t)$. Then, we identify a\nsignificant distinction between reconstruction codes for deletions and\ninsertions when $N=O(n^{t-1})$ and $t\\geq 2$. For deletions, we prove that\n$\\rho(n,q,\\tfrac{2(q-1)^{t-1}}{q^{t-1}(t-1)!}n^{t-1}+O(n^{t-2});\\mathcal{D}_t)=O(1)$,\nwhich disproves a conjecture posed in \\cite{Chrisnata-22-IT}. For insertions,\nwe show that\n$\\rho(n,q,\\tfrac{(q-1)^{t-1}}{(t-1)!}n^{t-1}+O(n^{t-2});\\mathcal{I}_t)=\\log\\log\nn + O(1)$, which extends a key result from \\cite{Ye-23-IT}. Finally, we\nconstruct $(n,q,N;\\mathcal{B})$-reconstruction codes, where $\\mathcal{B}\\in\n\\{\\mathcal{D}_2,\\mathcal{I}_2\\}$, for $N \\in \\{2,3, 4, 5\\}$ and establish\nrespective upper bounds of $3\\log n+O(\\log\\log n)$, $3\\log n+O(1)$, $2\\log\nn+O(\\log\\log n)$ and $\\log n+O(\\log\\log n)$ on the minimum redundancy\n$\\rho(n,q,N;\\mathcal{B})$.

We apply TAoI to a wireless monitoring system tasked with\nidentifying targets and transmitting their images for subsequent analysis. To\nminimize TAoI and determine the optimal transmission policy, we formulate the\ndynamic transmission problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) and\ntransform it into an equivalent Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our analysis\ndemonstrates that the optimal policy is threshold-based with respect to TAoI.\nBuilding on this, we propose a low-complexity relative value iteration\nalgorithm tailored to this threshold structure to derive the optimal\ntransmission policy.

To employ multi-waveguide PASS in multi-user\ncommunications, three practical transmission structures are proposed, namely\nwaveguide multiplexing (WM), waveguide division (WD), and waveguide switching\n(WS). Based on the proposed structures, the joint baseband signal processing\nand pinching beamforming design is studied for a general multi-group multicast\ncommunication system, with the unicast communication encompassed as a special\ncase. A max-min fairness problem is formulated for each proposed transmission\nstructure, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. For WM, to solve\nthe highly-coupled and non-convex MMF problem with complex exponential and\nfractional expressions, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is\ninvoked for obtaining locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the augmented\nLagrangian relaxation is first applied to alleviate the stringent coupling\nconstraints, which is followed by the block decomposition over the resulting\naugmented Lagrangian function.

Reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Q-learning, have been\nintroduced for decentralized routing by allowing nodes to make decisions based\non local observations. However, Q-learning suffers from scalability issues and\npoor generalization due to the difficulty in managing the Q-table in large or\ndynamic network topologies, especially in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with\ndiverse channel characteristics. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel deep\nQ-network (DQN)-based routing framework for heterogeneous multi-hop wireless\nnetworks to maximize the end-to-end rate of the route by improving scalability\nand adaptability, where each node uses a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate\nthe Q-values and jointly select the next-hop relay and a communication\ntechnology for transmission. To achieve better performance with the DNN,\nselecting which nodes to exchange information is critical, as it not only\ndefines the state and action spaces but also determines the input to the DNN.\nTo this end, we propose neighbor node selection strategies based on channel\ngain and rate between nodes rather than a simple distance-based approach for an\nimproved set of states and actions for DQN-based routing. During training, the\nmodel experiences diverse network topologies to ensure generalization and\nrobustness, and simulation results show that the proposed neighbor node\nselection outperforms simple distance-based selection. Further, we observe that\nthe DQN-based approach outperforms various benchmark schemes and performs\ncomparably to the optimal approach."}
