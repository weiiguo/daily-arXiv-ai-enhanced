To investigate their capabilities, we\nstudy the sum rate maximization problem in an SIM-based multiuser (MU)\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system. A vast majority of pioneer\nstudies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing\nalternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and\nSIM phase shifts are optimized alternately. However, many of these approaches\nsuffer from suboptimal performance, quickly leading to performance saturation,\nwhen the number of SIM layers increases assuming the \\emph{fixed SIM\nthickness}. In this letter, we demonstrate that significant performance gains\ncan still be achieved, and such saturation does not occur with the proposed\nmethod in the considered setting. To this end, we provide practical design\nguidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase\nshifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first\nyields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB\nfirst; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are\ngradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their\nscalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better\nperformance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing\nsolutions. Based on these customizations, the proposed method achieves a higher\nachievable sum rate (ASR) of up to $\\ensuremath{115.53\\%}$, compared to\nbenchmark schemes for the scenarios under consideration."}

In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is\nemployed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this\nsetup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in\nterms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the\nwireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp\ndistortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically\nshows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network\nresources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we\ndesign the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function\ndegradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The\nchallenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and\ncomputation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a\nlow-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control\nand the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less\nsensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained\nand vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed\nof one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.\nNumerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the\ntheoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well\ncoordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,\ncommunication, and computation to enhance the learning performance."}

It provides an\naccessible way for controlling the interaction between electromagnetic waves\nwith the propagation medium. One particularly important aspect is the\nconfiguration of the RIS elements or reflectors. Simply stated, the objective\nof the RIS configuration is to choose the optimum phase-shift combination that\nmaximizes the channel capacity. Recently, neural networks (NNs) were proposed\nfor tackling this task and results have shown that the proposed NN promotes far\nless reconfigurations of the RIS, consequently reducing the configuration\noverhead. Beyond that, the RIS can be repurposed for tackling the Doppler shift\nin high-mobility communication systems. Despite not being its usual primary\ngoal, results have also demonstrated that the RIS can compensate for the\nDoppler shift at a small cost in performance. However, the typical\nreflection-only constraint for RIS systems limits the spatial coverage and\nsignal amplification potential achieved by such systems. Therefore, the\nsimultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(STAR-RIS) can be employed to address these limitations by its dual\nfunctionality of transmitting and reflecting signals concurrently.
