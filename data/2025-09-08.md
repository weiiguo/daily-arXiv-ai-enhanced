### [1] [Communication-Efficient Collaborative LLM Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04576)
*Ce Zheng,Tingting Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 通过Top-K稀疏概率传输方案，在保持推理性能的同时大幅减少了AI-RAN中分布式预测解码的上行通信开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式预测解码在AI-RAN中需要传输全部词汇概率分布导致的大幅上行通信开销问题

Method: 提出Top-K Sparse Logits Transmission (TK-SLT)方案，只传输top-K令牌的原始概率和对应索引，而非全部分布

Result: 实验结果验证了方案的效率和有效性，在减少带宽消耗的同时保持了推理性能

Conclusion: TK-SLT方案为AI-RAN中协作推理提供了高效的通信优化方案，并推导了最优预测长度和速提比的理论分析

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an emerging technique that accelerates large language
model (LLM) inference by allowing a smaller draft model to predict multiple
tokens in advance, which are then verified or corrected by a larger target
model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this paradigm is
well-suited for collaborative inference between resource-constrained end
devices and more capable edge servers or base stations (BSs). However, existing
distributed speculative decoding requires transmitting the full vocabulary
probability distribution from the draft model on the device to the target model
at the BS, which leads to prohibitive uplink communication overhead. To address
this issue, we propose a ``Top-K Sparse Logits Transmission (TK-SLT)`` scheme,
where the draft model transmits only the top-K token raw probabilities and the
corresponding token indices instead of the entire distribution. This approach
significantly reduces bandwidth consumption while maintaining inference
performance. We further derive an analytical expression for the optimal draft
length that maximizes inference throughput, and provide a theoretical analysis
of the achievable speedup ratio under TK-SLT. Experimental results validate
both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于近场雷达模型的切向速度估计算法，解决了传统汽车雷达无法估计目标切向速度的问题，通过利用目标在距离、径向速度和多普勒域的迁移效应来提高估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统汽车雷达基于远场模型，只能估计目标的距离、径向速度和到达方向，但无法估计切向速度这一对动态环境感知至关重要的参数，这限制了雷达系统的感知能力。

Method: 引入近场雷达模型，考虑距离、径向速度和多普勒在时间和空间上的各种迁移效应；通过克拉美-罗界和模糊函数进行可识别性分析；采用分离阵列配置和计算高效的最大似然估计算法来利用目标迁移进行切向速度估计。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法提高了汽车雷达的准确性和可靠性，增强了高级驾驶辅助系统和自动驾驶车辆的环境感知能力，为解决切向速度估计问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work investigates the problem of tangential velocity estimation in
automotive radar systems, addressing the limitations of conventionally
considered models. Conventional automotive radars are usually based on
far-field models and estimate the target's range, radial velocity, and
direction-of-arrival (DOA) but are not able to estimate the tangential
component of the target 2-D velocity, which is a critical parameter for
reliable perception of dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we
introduce the near-field radar model, which considers various migration
elements in range, radial velocity, and Doppler along time and space.
Conventionally, these migration effects result in smearing of the likelihood
function for estimating the target parameters. However, if the model is
correctly specified, these migration effects are informative for tangential
velocity estimation. We conduct an identifiability analysis for tangential
velocity estimation using the Cram\'er-Rao bound and ambiguity function. The
insights from this study motivate the use of a separated array configuration
and the development of a computationally efficient maximum likelihood based
algorithm designed to utilize target migrations for tangential velocity
estimation, while maintaining practical computational complexity. In addition
to tangential velocity estimation, the proposed algorithm mitigates likelihood
smearing in range, radial velocity, and Doppler. Simulations validate the
theoretical feasibility study, and evaluate the algorithms' performance in both
single- and multi-target scenarios. The proposed approach improves the accuracy
and reliability of automotive radars, enhancing situational awareness for
advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.

### [3] [Environment-Aware IRS Deployment via Channel Knowledge Map: Joint Sensing-Communications Coverage Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04768)
*Yilong Chen,Zixiang Ren,Jie Xu,Rui Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了基于通道知识地图(CKM)的智能反射表面(IRS)部署优化方案，通过成略部署多个IRS来在保证感知和通信要求的前提下最小化系统成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决IRS启用的感通一体化(ISAC)系统中的部署优化问题，通过利用CKM提供的通道状态信息来提高感知和通信覆盖性能。

Method: 基于CKM获取通道状态信息，优化IRS部署、BS发射波束成型和IRS反射波束成型。采用混合整数非凸优化问题形式，通过成功凸近似(SCA)的松缚边界法求解。

Result: 数值结果证明所提出的算法能够在满足感知和通信要求的同时有效降低系统成本。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于CKM的环境感知IRS部署方案，通过聚合优化部署和波束成型，实现了感通一体化系统的成本效益最优化。

Abstract: This paper studies the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) deployment
optimization problem for IRS-enabled integrated sensing and communications
(ISAC) systems, in which multiple IRSs are strategically deployed at candidate
locations to assist a base station (BS) to enhance the coverage of both sensing
and communications. We present an environment-aware IRS deployment design via
exploiting the channel knowledge map (CKM), which provides the channel state
information (CSI) between each candidate IRS location and BS or targeted
sensing/communication points. Based on the obtained CSI from CKM, we optimize
the deployment of IRSs, jointly with the BS's transmit beamforming and IRSs'
reflective beamforming during operation, with the objective of minimizing the
system cost, while guaranteeing the minimum illumination power requirements at
sensing areas and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements at
communication areas. In particular, we consider two cases when the IRSs'
reflective beamforming optimization can be implemented dynamically in real time
and quasi-stationarily over the whole operation period, respectively. For both
cases, the joint IRS deployment and transmit/reflective beamforming designs are
formulated as mixed-integer non-convex optimization problems, which are solved
via the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based relax-and-bound method.
Specifically, we first relax the binary IRS deployment indicators into
continuous variables, then find converged solutions via SCA, and finally round
relaxed indicators back to binary values. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in reducing the system cost while
meeting the sensing and communication requirements.

### [4] [SREC: Encrypted Semantic Super-Resolution Enhanced Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04787)
*Zhidi Zhang,Rui Meng,Song Gao,Haixiao Gao,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出加密语义超分辨率增强通信(SREC)方法，通过模256加密和超分辨率重建技术保护语义通信安全，在低信噪比条件下实现安全稳定的传输性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义通信(SemCom)作为AI与通信技术深度融合的典型范式，显著提高了通信效率和资源利用率，但其安全问题日益突出。明文传输的语义特征容易被窃听者拦截，需要解决语义通信的安全性问题

Method: 使用模256加密方法对语义特征进行加密，并采用超分辨率重建方法来提高图像的重建质量

Result: 在加性高斯白噪声(AWGN)信道中，使用不同调制方法时，SREC不仅能稳定保证安全性，还能在低信噪比(SNR)条件下实现更好的传输性能

Conclusion: SREC方法有效解决了语义通信的安全性问题，通过加密和超分辨率技术的结合，在保证安全的同时提升了低信噪比环境下的通信性能

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom), as a typical paradigm of deep integration
between artificial intelligence (AI) and communication technology,
significantly improves communication efficiency and resource utilization
efficiency. However, the security issues of SemCom are becoming increasingly
prominent. Semantic features transmitted in plaintext over physical channels
are easily intercepted by eavesdroppers. To address this issue, this paper
proposes Encrypted Semantic Super-Resolution Enhanced Communication (SREC) to
secure SemCom. SREC uses the modulo-256 encryption method to encrypt semantic
features, and employs super-resolution reconstruction method to improve the
reconstruction quality of images. The simulation results show that in the
additive Gaussian white noise (AWGN) channel, when different modulation methods
are used, SREC can not only stably guarantee security, but also achieve better
transmission performance under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

### [5] [Rotatable Antenna Aided Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communications in the Upper Mid-Band: Interference Analysis and Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04865)
*Yunpu Zhang,Changsheng You,Hing Cheung So,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 通过旋转天线提供新的空间自由度，用于减轻混合近远场通信系统中的复杂干扰，显著提升通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合近场和远场通信系统中存在复杂的近场干扰和混合场干扰，传统固定天线系统难以有效减轻这些干扰。

Conclusion: 旋转天线为混合近远场通信系统提供了有效的干扰减轻方案，通过聚合优化设计可实现显著的通信性能改善。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving
the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication
systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna
rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field
interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field
downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple
RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of
several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to
maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power
allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful
insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze
a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain
closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field
interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using
the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation
effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing
mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving
subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to
obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power
allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the
outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm
optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant
performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to
benchmark schemes.

### [6] [KGRAG-SC: Knowledge Graph RAG-Assisted Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04801)
*Dayu Fan,Rui Meng,Song Gao,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: KGRAG-SC是一个知识图谱辅助的语义通信框架，通过检索增强生成技术解决传统语义通信在噪声条件下语义选择和重建的鲁棒性问题，显著降低传输开销并提高低信噪比下的语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信方案依赖端到端深度学习框架，缺乏可解释性，在噪声条件下语义选择和重建的鲁棒性不足，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用知识图谱辅助框架，通过社区引导的实体链接和GraphRAG处理进行语义提取，传输最小连通子图和紧凑实体索引，使用重要性感知自适应传输策略，接收端利用大语言模型进行知识驱动的文本重建。

Result: 在低信噪比条件下实现了优越的语义保真度，相比传统通信方法显著降低了传输开销。

Conclusion: 将结构化知识表示与生成语言模型集成到语义通信系统中是有效的，KGRAG-SC框架为解决语义通信的鲁棒性问题提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: The state-of-the-art semantic communication (SC) schemes typically rely on
end-to-end deep learning frameworks that lack interpretability and struggle
with robust semantic selection and reconstruction under noisy conditions. To
address this issue, this paper presents KGRAG-SC, a knowledge graph-assisted SC
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation principles. KGRAG-SC
employs a multi-dimensional knowledge graph, enabling efficient semantic
extraction through community-guided entity linking and GraphRAG-assisted
processing. The transmitter constructs minimal connected subgraphs that capture
essential semantic relationships and transmits only compact entity indices
rather than full text or semantic triples. An importance-aware adaptive
transmission strategy provides unequal error protection based on structural
centrality metrics, prioritizing critical semantic elements under adverse
channel conditions. At the receiver, large language models perform
knowledge-driven text reconstruction using the shared knowledge graph as
structured context, ensuring robust semantic recovery even with partial
information loss. Experimental results demonstrate that KGRAG-SC achieves
superior semantic fidelity in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while
significantly reducing transmission overhead compared to traditional
communication methods, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating structured
knowledge representation with generative language models for SC systems.

### [7] [SemSteDiff: Generative Diffusion Model-based Coverless Semantic Steganography Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04803)
*Song Gao,Rui Meng,Xiaodong Xu,Haixiao Gao,Yiming Liu,Chenyuan Feng,Ping Zhang,Tony Q. S. Quek,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于生成扩散模型的语义隐写通信方案SemSteDiff，将秘密图像隐藏到生成的隐写图像中，通过语义相关的公私钥对实现合法接收者正确解码，同时阻止窃听者获取信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义通信面临窃听威胁，现有语义隐写通信方案依赖预选封面图像，限制了方案的通用性。需要设计不依赖特定封面图像的语义隐写通信方法。

Method: 基于生成扩散模型，设计无封面语义隐写通信方案SemSteDiff。使用语义相关的公私钥对，合法接收者能正确解码秘密图像，而无完整密钥对的窃听者无法获取信息。

Result: 在不同JSCC框架中验证了即插即用设计的有效性。在SNR=0dB时，合法接收者的PSNR比窃听者高4.14dB，证明了方案的安全性和有效性。

Conclusion: SemSteDiff方案成功解决了现有语义隐写通信对预选封面图像的依赖问题，提供了更通用的语义安全通信解决方案，在对抗智能窃听方面表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom), as a novel paradigm for future communication
systems, has recently attracted much attention due to its superiority in
communication efficiency. However, similar to traditional communication, it
also suffers from eavesdropping threats. Intelligent eavesdroppers could launch
advanced semantic analysis techniques to infer secret semantic information.
Therefore, some researchers have designed Semantic Steganography Communication
(SemSteCom) scheme to confuse semantic eavesdroppers. However, the
state-of-the-art SemSteCom schemes for image transmission rely on the
pre-selected cover image, which limits the universality. To address this issue,
we propose a Generative Diffusion Model-based Coverless Semantic Steganography
Communication (SemSteDiff) scheme to hide secret images into generated stego
images. The semantic related private and public keys enable legitimate receiver
to decode secret images correctly while the eavesdropper without completely
true key-pairs fail to obtain them. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the plug-and-play design in different Joint Source-Channel
Coding (JSCC) frameworks. The comparison results under different eavesdroppers'
threats show that, when Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) = 0 dB, the peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the legitimate receiver is 4.14 dB higher than
that of the eavesdropper.

### [8] [AI-Driven Fronthaul Link Compression in Wireless Communication Systems: Review and Method Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04805)
*Keqin Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文综述AI驱动的无线前传压缩技术，重点分析CSI反馈和RB粒度预编码优化两种高压缩方法，并提出面向cell-free架构的前传压缩策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代无线前传链路需要在高带宽和低延迟约束下传输高维信号，传统压缩方法在高压缩比下性能急剧下降且难以调优，需要AI驱动的智能压缩方案。

Method: 采用端到端学习、向量和分层量化、学习熵模型等技术，重点研究CSI反馈端到端学习和RB粒度预编码优化与压缩相结合的方法。

Result: 提出了针对cell-free架构的前传压缩策略，实现高压缩比下的可控性能损失，支持RB级速率自适应，满足下一代网络集中式协作传输的低延迟需求。

Conclusion: AI驱动的压缩技术能有效利用信道状态信息等信号结构，为下一代无线网络前传链路提供高性能压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Modern fronthaul links in wireless systems must transport high-dimensional
signals under stringent bandwidth and latency constraints, which makes
compression indispensable. Traditional strategies such as compressed sensing,
scalar quantization, and fixed-codec pipelines often rely on restrictive
priors, degrade sharply at high compression ratios, and are hard to tune across
channels and deployments. Recent progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
brought end-to-end learned transforms, vector and hierarchical quantization,
and learned entropy models that better exploit the structure of Channel State
Information(CSI), precoding matrices, I/Q samples, and LLRs. This paper first
surveys AI-driven compression techniques and then provides a focused analysis
of two representative high-compression routes: CSI feedback with end-to-end
learning and Resource Block (RB) granularity precoding optimization combined
with compression. Building on these insights, we propose a fronthaul
compression strategy tailored to cell-free architectures. The design targets
high compression with controlled performance loss, supports RB-level rate
adaptation, and enables low-latency inference suitable for centralized
cooperative transmission in next-generation networks.

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型学习目标先验分布，然后结合物理前向模型进行后验采样，通过交替采样器分别强制执行似然和先验分布

Result: 在脑成像实验中达到最先进的重建精度和结构相似性，同时保持高测量保真度

Conclusion: 该方法能够灵活整合先验知识到基于物理的反演中，无需配对测量-标签数据集，为定量电磁脑成像提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) imaging is an important tool for non-invasive sensing
with low-cost and portable devices. One emerging application is EM stroke
imaging, which enables early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of brain
strokes. Quantitative imaging is achieved by solving an inverse scattering
problem (ISP) that reconstructs permittivity and conductivity maps from
measurements. In general, the reconstruction accuracy is limited by its
inherent nonlinearity and ill-posedness. Existing methods, including
learning-free and learning-based approaches, fail to either incorporate
complicated prior distributions or provide theoretical guarantees, posing
difficulties in balancing interpretability, distortion error, and reliability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a posterior sampling method based on
latent diffusion for quantitative EM brain imaging, adapted from a generative
plug-and-play (PnP) posterior sampling framework. Our approach allows to
flexibly integrate prior knowledge into physics-based inversion without
requiring paired measurement-label datasets. We first learn the prior
distribution of targets from an unlabeled dataset, and then incorporate the
learned prior into posterior sampling. In particular, we train a latent
diffusion model on permittivity and conductivity maps to capture their prior
distribution. Then, given measurements and the forward model describing EM wave
physics, we perform posterior sampling by alternating between two samplers that
respectively enforce the likelihood and prior distributions. Finally, reliable
reconstruction is obtained through minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation
based on the samples. Experimental results on brain imaging demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy
and structural similarity while maintaining high measurement fidelity.

TL;DR: 该论文研究可移动智能反射面(MIRS)辅助的集成感知与通信系统，通过联合优化MIRS元素位置、反射系数、发射波束成形和接收滤波器，最小化满足感知和通信服务质量所需的功率。提出了元素级控制和阵列级控制两种方案，并开发了基于黎曼流形优化的PRMO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能反射面(IRS)位置固定，限制了系统性能。可移动智能反射面(MIRS)技术通过灵活调整反射元素位置，能够提高系统适应性和性能，特别是在集成感知与通信(ISAC)系统中具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了两种MIRS控制方案：元素级控制和阵列级控制。开发了基于惩罚变换和黎曼BFGS算法的乘积黎曼流形优化(PRMO)方法，在构造的乘积黎曼流形空间(PRMS)中并行更新变量。

Conclusion: MIRS技术能够显著提升ISAC系统性能，元素级控制提供最优性能，阵列级控制提供性能与计算效率的良好平衡，为实际系统部署提供了灵活选择。

Abstract: Driven by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA)
technologies, movable IRS (MIRS) has been proposed to improve the adaptability
and performance of conventional IRS, enabling flexible adjustment of the IRS
reflecting element positions. This paper investigates MIRS-aided integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The objective is to minimize the
power required for satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) of sensing and
communication by jointly optimizing the MIRS element positions, IRS reflection
coefficients, transmit beamforming, and receive filters. To balance the
performance-cost trade-off, we proposed two MIRS schemes: element-wise control
and array-wise control, where the positions of individual reflecting elements
and arrays consisting of multiple elements are controllable, respectively. To
address the joint beamforming and position optimization, a product Riemannian
manifold optimization (PRMO) method is proposed, where the variables are
updated over a constructed product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) in parallel
via penalty-based transformation and Riemannian
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) algorithm. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed MIRS outperforms conventional IRS in power
minimization with both element-wise control and array-wise control.
Specifically, with different system parameters, the minimum power is achieved
by the MIRS with the element-wise control scheme, while suboptimal solution and
higher computational efficiency are achieved by the MIRS with array-wise
control scheme.

Abstract: In this article, a Probability Mass Function (PMF) estimation method which
tames the curse of dimensionality is proposed. This method, called Partial
Coupled Tensor Factorization of 3D marginals or PCTF3D, has for principle to
partially couple order-3 data projections -- seen as order-3 tensors -- to
obtain a tensor decomposition of the probability mass tensor. The novelty of
PCTF3D relies on partial coupling which consists in choosing a subset of 3D
marginals. The choice of marginals is then formulated with hypergraphs. After
presenting possible coupling strategies, some numerical experiments and an
application of the method are proposed. This article is the first of a two-part
article. While this first article focuses on a new algorithmic framework for
PMF estimation, the second studies uniqueness properties of the model
introduced in this article.

Abstract: In this paper, uniqueness properties of a coupled tensor model are studied.
This new coupled tensor model is used in a new method called Partial Coupled
Tensor Factorization of 3D marginals or PCTF3D. This method performs estimation
of probability mass functions by coupling 3D marginals, seen as order-3
tensors. The core novelty of PCTF3D's approach (detailed in the part I article)
relies on the partial coupling which consists on the choice of 3D marginals to
be coupled. Tensor methods are ubiquitous in many applications of statistical
learning, with their biggest advantage of having strong uniqueness properties.
In this paper, the uniqueness properties of PCTF3D's constrained coupled
low-rank model is assessed. While probabilistic constraints of the coupled
model are handled properly, it is shown that uniqueness highly depends on the
coupling used in PCTF3D. After proposing a Jacobian algorithm providing maximum
recoverable rank, different coupling strategies presented in the Part I article
are examined with respect to their uniqueness properties. Finally, an
identifiability bound is given for a so-called Cartesian coupling which permits
enhancing sufficient bounds of the literature.

### [13] [ROPE: A Novel Method for Real-Time Phase Estimation of Complex Biological Rhythms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04962)
*Antonio Spallone,Marco Coraggio,Francesco De Lellis,Mario di Bernardo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ROPE是首个能够处理任意维度信号并实时运行且误差最小的相位估计算法，通过识别信号中的重复模式进行分段并执行高效搜索来分配相位值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相位估计方法通常仅限于离线处理和/或一维信号，无法满足实时分析复杂生物节律的需求。

Method: ROPE通过识别信号中的重复模式将其分割为（伪）周期，并通过对先前信号段执行高效、可处理的搜索来分配相位值。

Result: 在混沌动力系统轨迹、人体运动捕捉数据和心电图记录等多种信号类型上验证，ROPE对噪声和信号漂移具有鲁棒性，性能显著优于最先进的相位估计方法。

Conclusion: ROPE实现了复杂生物节律的实时分析，为病理节律紊乱的早期诊断和神经系统与心血管疾病的节律治疗干预开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Accurate phase estimation -- the process of assigning phase values between
$0$ and $2\pi$ to repetitive or periodic signals -- is a cornerstone in the
analysis of oscillatory signals across diverse fields, from neuroscience to
robotics, where it is fundamental, e.g., to understanding coordination in
neural networks, cardiorespiratory coupling, and human-robot interaction.
However, existing methods are often limited to offline processing and/or
constrained to one-dimensional signals. In this paper, we introduce ROPE,
which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first phase-estimation algorithm
capable of (i) handling signals of arbitrary dimension and (ii) operating in
real-time, with minimal error. ROPE identifies repetitions within the signal to
segment it into (pseudo-)periods and assigns phase values by performing
efficient, tractable searches over previous signal segments. We extensively
validate the algorithm on a variety of signal types, including trajectories
from chaotic dynamical systems, human motion-capture data, and
electrocardiographic recordings. Our results demonstrate that ROPE is robust
against noise and signal drift, and achieves significantly superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art phase estimation methods. This advancement enables
real-time analysis of complex biological rhythms, opening new pathways, for
example, for early diagnosis of pathological rhythm disruptions and developing
rhythm-based therapeutic interventions in neurological and cardiovascular
disorders.
