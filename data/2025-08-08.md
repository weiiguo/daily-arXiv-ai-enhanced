  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子通信中因混合分子初始浓度相同导致的高保真传输技术（如MoSK）受限的问题。

Conclusion: 通过能量高效的分子转移技术优化分子通信系统性能。

Abstract: Information molecules play a crucial role in molecular communication (MC),
acting as carriers for information transfer. A common approach to get
information molecules in MC involves harvesting them from the environment;
however, the harvested molecules are often a mixture of various environmental
molecules, and the initial concentration ratios in the reservoirs are
identical, which hampers high-fidelity transmission techniques such as
molecular shift keying (MoSK). This paper presents a transmitter design that
harvests molecules from the surrounding environment and stores them in two
reservoirs. To separate the mixed molecules, energy is consumed to transfer
them between reservoirs. Given limited energy resources, this work explores
energy-efficient strategies to optimize transmitter performance. Through
theoretical analysis and simulations, we investigate different methods for
moving molecules between reservoirs. The results demonstrate that transferring
higher initial concentration molecules enhances transmitter performance, while
using fewer molecules per transfer further improves efficiency. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimizing MC systems through energy-efficient
molecule transfer techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定位置天线（FPA）系统在能量效率上存在局限，而MA系统通过动态调整天线位置可能提升效率。

Method: 推导单用户下行链路通信系统的能量效率上限，提出基于连续凸近似的算法优化MA位置。

Result: 仿真结果表明，尽管MA移动带来额外开销，其能量效率仍优于FPA系统。

Conclusion: MA系统在能量效率优化方面具有潜力，能够克服移动开销的负面影响。

Abstract: This paper investigates the energy efficiency optimization for movable
antenna (MA) systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption
introduced by MA movement. We first derive the upper bound on energy efficiency
for a single-user downlink communication system, where the user is equipped
with a single MA. Then, the energy efficiency maximization problem is
formulated to optimize the MA position, and an efficient algorithm based on
successive convex approximation is proposed to solve this non-convex
optimization problem. Simulation results show that, despite the overhead caused
by MA movement, the MA system can still improve the energy efficiency compared
to the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) system.

### [3] [Two tales for a geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05066)
*Frank Nielsen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种扩展的几何Jensen-Shannon散度（G-JSD），适用于正密度而不需归一化几何混合，并给出了其与G-JSD的差距及上下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何Jensen-Shannon散度（G-JSD）因其在高斯分布间的闭式表达而流行，但需要归一化几何混合。本文旨在提出一种无需归一化的扩展版本。

Method: 提出扩展G-JSD，分析其与G-JSD的差距，并给出上下界。针对多元高斯分布推导闭式表达式。

Result: 扩展G-JSD适用于更广泛的正测度，且与G-JSD的差距可通过其他统计散度界定。

Conclusion: 扩展G-JSD和G-JSD可视为普通JSD的正则化形式，为机器学习提供了新的工具。

Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine
learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between
Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of
the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which
does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the
extended G-JSD as it extends to more general positive measures. We give
explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and G-JSD when considering
probability densities, and report both lower and upper bounds in terms of other
statistical divergences. We derive corresponding closed-form expressions when
considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in
applications. Finally, we show that these two types of geometric JSDs, the
G-JSD and the extended G-JSD, can be interpreted as regularizations of the
ordinary JSD by additive terms.

### [4] [Necessity of Block Designs for Optimal Locally Private Distribution Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05110)
*Abigail Gentle*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文证明了在局部差分隐私下，任何实现最优误差的协议必须对应于某种平衡不完全区组设计，从而完全描述了该问题的最优协议集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在局部差分隐私模型下，除了基于平衡不完全区组设计的协议外，是否存在其他构造也能实现最优误差。

Method: 通过数学证明，验证任何实现最优误差的协议必须对应于平衡不完全区组设计。

Result: 证明了最优协议必须对应于平衡不完全区组设计，且最优误差和最优通信的协议仅基于对称平衡不完全区组设计。

Conclusion: 该结果与先前工作结合，完全描述了局部差分隐私下分布估计问题的最优协议集。

Abstract: Local differential privacy represents the gold standard for preserving the
privacy of data before it leaves the device, and distribution estimation under
this model has been well studied. Recently, protocols built upon balanced
incomplete block designs were shown to achieve optimal error for this problem.
However, it remained unknown whether other constructions could also be optimal.
We resolve this question by proving that any protocol achieving optimal error
must correspond to some balanced incomplete block design. This result, combined
with prior work, completely characterises the set of optimal protocols for this
problem. As a consequence, the protocols that achieve optimal error and optimal
communication are only those based on symmetrical balanced incomplete block
designs.

### [5] [Neural Estimation of Information Leakage for Secure Communication System Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05176)
*Darius S. Heerklotz,Ingo Schroeder,Pin-Hsun Lin,Christian Deppe,Eduard A. Jorswieck*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的互信息估计器，用于量化通信系统中的信息泄漏，并设计了适用于更高块长度的通用哈希族。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 仿真显示，现有方法在高块长度下显著低估互信息，而新方法可将块长度扩展至255，并推测在足够训练数据下可进一步扩展。

Conclusion: 提出的估计器和自适应哈希设计框架为有限块长度下的物理层安全提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Underestimating the leakage can compromise secrecy, while overestimating it
may lead to inefficient system design. Therefore, a reliable leakage estimator
is essential. Neural network-based estimators provide a data-driven way to
estimate mutual information without requiring full knowledge of the channel or
source distributions. In this work, we aim to scale the blocklength of a
wiretap code such that the estimator can still feasibly operate. We propose an
improved mutual information estimator based on the variational contrastive
log-ration upper bound framework, tailored for both discrete and continuous
variables. By using a mixture of Bernoulli experts parameterized by neural
networks, the estimator is able to quantify information leakage in
communication systems, which employ complex data processing like universal hash
family. We further propose a method to utilize the proposed estimator to design
the universal hash family for a wiretap code or secret key generation design.
Simulation results show thatprior methods significantly underestimate the
mutual information, particularly when using universal hash family for higher
blocklengths ($n\gg$16). The proposed method can scale the blocklength up to
255, and we conjecture that the design can scale well to even higher
blocklengths given adequate training data and model size. Additionally, we
contend that our proposed estimator and adaptive hash design framework offer a
practical approach for extending physical layer security considerations for
wiretap channels into the finite blocklength regime.

### [6] [Simultaneous Rational Function Codes: Improved Analysis Beyond Half the Minimum Distance with Multiplicities and Poles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05284)
*Matteo Abbondati,Eleonora Guerrini,Romain Lebreton*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Abbondati等人（2024）关于解码同时有理函数编码的工作，解决了多重性和极点问题，改进了解码算法的失败概率分析，并扩展到混合模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有理函数编码中的多重性和极点问题，提升解码算法的鲁棒性和适用范围。

Method: 1. 通过多精度评估推广到具有多重性的有理编码；2. 使用混合模型处理可能存在的极点。

Result: 提供了解码算法失败概率的严格分析，扩展了混合模型，并在更一般的背景下改进了分析。

Conclusion: 理论结果为复杂场景下的重建失败提供了全面的概率分析，推动了有理函数编码纠错技术的前沿。

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the work of Abbondati et al. (2024) on decoding
simultaneous rational function codes by addressing two important scenarios:
multiplicities and poles (zeros of denominators). First, we generalize previous
results to rational codes with multiplicities by considering evaluations with
multi-precision. Then, using the hybrid model from Guerrini et al. (2023), we
extend our approach to vectors of rational functions that may present poles.
Our contributions include: a rigorous analysis of the decoding algorithm's
failure probability that generalizes and improves several previous results, an
extension to a hybrid model handling situations where not all errors can be
assumed random, and a new improved analysis in the more general context
handling poles within multiplicities. The theoretical results provide a
comprehensive probabilistic analysis of reconstruction failure in these more
complex scenarios, advancing the state of the art in error correction for
rational function codes.

### [7] [Fundamental limit of Sum Capacity in Pinching Antenna Assisted Multiple Access Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05309)
*Guangji Chen,Qingqing Wu,Kangda Zhi*

Main category: cs.IT

Result: 理想情况下，交替传输可实现最大信道增益，无需NOMA；推导了容量上限和有限条件下的下限。

Conclusion: 动态pinching波束成形能显著提升容量，数值结果验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASSs) have recently shown their promising ability
to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels via dynamically adjusting the
positions of pinching antennas over a dielectric waveguide, termed as pinching
beamforming. This paper studies the fundamental limit of the sum capacity for a
PASSassisted multiple access channel, in which multiple users transmit
individual messages to a BS under the average power constraint. To this end, we
consider a dynamic pinching beamforming setup, where multiple pinching
beamforming vectors are employed in a transmission period and the
capacity-achieving non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based transmission
scheme is considered. For the ideal case with an asymptotically large number of
pinching beamforming vectors, we unveil that the optimal transmission scheme is
alternating transmission among each user with its channel power gain maximized
by dynamic pinching beamforming, which implies that the NOMA-based transmission
scheme is not needed. The corresponding sum-rate is derived in closed-form
expression, which serves as the upper bound of the sum-capacity. Inspired by
this result, a lower bound of the sum-rate under an arbitrarily finite number
of pinching beamforming vectors is obtained. Numerical results validate our
theoretical findings and illustrate the practical significance of using dynamic
pinching beamforming to improve the sum capacity.

Motivation: 探索混合字母表$\mathbb{F}_2\mathbb{F}_4$上的ACD码的性质及其与二进制LCD码的关系，以扩展编码理论的应用范围。

Method: 通过定义在$\mathbb{F}_2\mathbb{F}_4$上的内积，建立ACD码的充分条件，并利用线性映射$W$构造二进制LCD码。

Result: 证明了ACD码的二进制图像为LCD码时，原码必为ACD码，并给出了一个距离最优的二进制LCD码实例。

Conclusion: ACD码在混合字母表上的研究为构造二进制LCD码提供了新的途径，且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structure and properties of additive
complementary dual (ACD) codes over the mixed alphabet
$\mathbb{F}_2\mathbb{F}_4$ relative to a certain inner product defined over
$\mathbb{F}_2\mathbb{F}_4$. We establish sufficient conditions under which such
codes are additive complementary dual (ACD) codes. We also show that ACD codes
over $\mathbb{F}_{2}\mathbb{F}_{4}$ can be applied to construct binary linear
complementary dual codes as their images under the linear map $W$. Notably, we
prove that if the binary image of a code is LCD, then the original code is
necessarily ACD. An example is given where the image is a distance-optimal
binary LCD code.

### [9] [On the entropy growth of sums of iid discrete random variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05348)
*Riccardo Castellano,Pavel Sekatski*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文推导了独立同分布离散随机变量和的香农熵的渐近下界，提出了一个称为不可公度秩的新概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究独立同分布离散随机变量和的熵的渐近行为，填补现有理论的空白。

Method: 利用多项分布和格点随机变量和的已知熵表达式，不依赖中心极限定理。

Result: 推导出熵的下界公式：$H \geq \frac{r(X)}{2}\log(N) + {\it cst}$，其中$r(X)$为不可公度秩。

Conclusion: 提出的不可公度秩为理解离散随机变量和的熵提供了新视角。

Abstract: We derive an asymptotic lower bound on the Shannon entropy $H$ of sums of $N$
arbitrary iid discrete random variables. The derived bound $H \geq
\frac{r(X)}{2}\log(N) + {\it cst}$ is given in terms of the incommensurability
rank $r(X)$ of the random variable -- a positive integer quantity that we
introduce. The derivation does not rely on central limit theorems, but builds
upon the known expressions of the asymptotic entropy of the multinomial
distribution and sums of iid lattice random variables, which correspond to the
case $r(X)=1$.

### [10] [Communication-Efficient Distributed Computing Through Combinatorial Multi-Access Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05426)
*Shanuja Sasi,Onur Günlü*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多接入分布式计算（MADC）模型，利用组合设计和编码技术减少通信开销，优化计算负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MapReduce框架需要文件复制，而MADC通过编码技术避免这一需求，旨在降低通信成本。

Method: 采用组合设计（t-designs）构建高效编码方案，连接t-designs与MapReduce数组，优化计算负载为1。

Result: 方案显著减少了减速器节点数量，但增加了通信成本。

Conclusion: MADC模型通过组合设计和编码技术，为分布式计算提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores the multi-access distributed computing (MADC) model, a
novel distributed computing framework where mapper and reducer nodes are
distinct entities. Unlike traditional MapReduce frameworks, MADC leverages
coding-theoretic techniques to minimize communication overhead without
necessitating file replication across mapper nodes. We introduce a new approach
utilizing combinatorial designs, specifically t-designs, to construct efficient
coding schemes that achieve a computation load of 1. By establishing a
connection between t-designs and MapReduce Arrays, we characterize the
achievable communication loads and demonstrate the flexibility of our method in
selecting the number of reducer nodes. The proposed scheme significantly
reduces the number of reducer nodes relative to existing combinatorial topology
schemes, at the expense of increased communication cost.

### [11] [Long Polar vs. LDPC Codes under Complexity-Constrained Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05485)
*Felix Krieg,Marvin Rübenacke,Andreas Zunker,Stephan ten Brink*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 长极化码在固定点对数似然比（LLR）操作次数相近时，通过连续消除（SC）解码优于LDPC码，尤其在简化连续消除（SSC）解码下复杂度更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战业界和学术界普遍认为极化码在长码长下不如LDPC码的观点，指出实际应用中LDPC码的迭代次数受限。

Method: 比较极化码（SC和SSC解码）与LDPC码（BP解码）在固定点LLR操作次数下的性能。

Result: 长极化码在SC解码下表现优于LDPC码，SSC解码的复杂度低于N logN且操作次数少于单次BP迭代。

Conclusion: 极化码在长码长和实际约束下仍具竞争力，尤其是在复杂度优化方面。

Abstract: The prevailing opinion in industry and academia is that polar codes are
competitive for short code lengths, but can no longer keep up with low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes as block length increases. This view is typically
based on the assumption that LDPC codes can be decoded with a large number of
belief propagation (BP) iterations. However, in practice, the number of
iterations may be rather limited due to latency and complexity constraints. In
this paper, we show that for a similar number of fixed-point log-likelihood
ratio (LLR) operations, long polar codes under successive cancellation (SC)
decoding outperform their LDPC counterparts. In particular, simplified
successive cancellation (SSC) decoding of polar codes exhibits a better
complexity scaling than $N \log{N}$ and requires fewer operations than a single
BP iteration of an LDPC code with the same parameters.

### [12] [Multivariate Partial Information Decomposition: Constructions, Inconsistencies, and Alternative Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05530)
*Aobo Lyu,Andrew Clark,Netanel Raviv*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文分析了多元信息分解（PID）框架的局限性，提出了解决两源PID的闭式公式，证明了多源PID的不一致性，并提出了新的多元独特和协同信息度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PID框架在多变量系统中无法捕捉复杂、细粒度交互的问题。

Method: 通过闭式公式解决两源PID，证明多源PID的不一致性，并提出新的度量方法。

Result: 成功解决两源PID问题，发现多源PID的不一致性，并提出有效的替代度量方法。

Conclusion: PID框架在多源情况下存在根本性不一致，需要新的多元信息分解框架。

Abstract: While mutual information effectively quantifies dependence between two
variables, it cannot capture complex, fine-grained interactions that emerge in
multivariate systems.The Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework was
introduced to address this by decomposing the mutual information between a set
of source variables and a target variable into fine-grained information atoms
such as redundant, unique, and synergistic components. In this work, we review
the axiomatic system and desired properties of the PID framework and make three
main contributions. First, we resolve the two-source PID case by providing
explicit closed-form formulas for all information atoms that satisfy the full
set of axioms and desirable properties. Second, we prove that for three or more
sources, PID suffers from fundamental inconsistencies: we present a
three-variable counterexample where the sum of atoms exceeds the total
information, and prove an impossibility theorem showing that no lattice-based
decomposition can be consistent for all subsets when the number of sources
exceeds three. Finally, we deviate from the PID lattice approach to avoid its
inconsistencies, and present explicit measures of multivariate unique and
synergistic information. Our proposed measures, which rely on new systems of
random variables that eliminate higher-order dependencies, satisfy key axioms
such as additivity and continuity, provide a robust theoretical explanation of
high-order relations, and show strong numerical performance in comprehensive
experiments on the Ising model. Our findings highlight the need for a new
framework for studying multivariate information decomposition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成感知、通信和计算系统需要高效协同，而现有方法在延迟和资源分配上存在不足。引入可移动天线（MAs）以优化系统性能。

Method: 提出双层迭代算法，结合粒子群优化和凸优化，联合优化MA位置、计算资源分配和波束成形。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案相比基线方案显著降低了最大延迟。

Conclusion: 通过优化MA位置和资源分配，系统性能得到显著提升，验证了所提算法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled integrated
sensing, communication, and computation system, with a particular focus on
integrating movable antennas (MAs) into the system for enhancing overall system
performance. Specifically, multiple MA-enabled AVVs perform sensing tasks and
simultaneously transmit the generated computational tasks to the base station
for processing. To minimize the maximum latency under the sensing and resource
constraints, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly coordinates the
position of the MAs, the computation resource allocation, and the transmit
beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and strong
coupling among variables, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm leveraging
particle swarm optimization and convex optimization to address it. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant
latency improvements compared to the baseline schemes.

Conclusion: 这些波形无关的算法易于集成到现有软件定义无线电系统中，为雷达信号处理提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: General requirements for radar digital signal processing are ionospheric
distortion and Doppler dispersion correction, which has historically required
radar-specific hardware to implement in real time. Although analog solutions
are computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks
which limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of
system complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems,
real-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using
non-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an
analysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary
waveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations
for efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically
using GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as
execution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations
for application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for
dispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a
numerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion.
Both of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in
accuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed
in real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. These methods are waveform agnostic
and applied directly to the samples, improving system flexibility and making
them easy to incorporate into existing software-defined radio systems.

Conclusion: 分布式RIMSA结合DRL和抗干扰设计，显著提升了无线感知的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has
garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable
and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods
is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the
receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing
distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect
the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)
are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,
RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem
is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping
of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we
introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating
the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting
received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may
potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable
effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss
function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed
distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and
better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.
Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance
even under jamming attack.

*Sippanon Kitimoon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种基于局部核的信号处理方法，用于噪声条件下的参数恢复，分别针对多维指数模型和线性调频信号分离，均表现出较高的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在低信噪比条件下参数恢复的挑战，特别是多维指数模型和线性调频信号的分离问题。

Method: 1. 使用局部三角多项式核检测多维频率，并通过坐标投影和配准提高恢复精度；2. 基于局部核构建信号分离算子，通过FFT滤波和分段线性回归分离线性调频信号。

Result: 在低信噪比下优于传统方法（如MUSIC和ESPRIT），且能恢复交叉和不连续的调频信号。

Conclusion: 局部核和高效FFT实现的方法具有鲁棒性和可扩展性，适用于多种信号处理场景。

Abstract: This dissertation presents two signal processing methods using specially
designed localized kernels for parameter recovery under noisy condition. The
first method addresses the estimation of frequencies and amplitudes in
multidimensional exponential models. It utilizes localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels to detect the multivariate frequencies, followed by a more
detailed parameter estimation. We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT,
which are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the
parameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method
outperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the
multivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration
approach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples
than other methods.
  The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from
time-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency
estimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with
piecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the
number of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous
chirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB.
  Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based
implementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity
regularization. Experimental results confirm the robustness and tractability of
the proposed approaches across a range of simulated data conditions. Potential
extensions include application to nonlinear chirps, adaptive kernel design, and
signal classification using extracted features.

Abstract: To utilize the full potential of the available power at a base station (BS),
we propose a joint precoding, antenna selection, and transmit power control
algorithm for a total power budget at the BS. We formulate a sum spectral
efficiency (SE) maximization problem for downlink multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems with
arbitrary-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). We reformulate the
problem by defining the ergodic sum SE using the conditional average rate
approach to handle imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT), and by using approximation techniques to make the problem more
tractable. Then, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power
control subproblems. We solve the precoding direction subproblem by identifying
a superior Lagrangian stationary point, and the power control subproblem using
gradient descent. We also propose a complexity-reduction approach that is more
suitable for massive MIMO systems. Simulation results not only validate the
proposed algorithm but also reveal that when utilizing the full potential of
the power budget at the BS, medium-resolution DACs with 8-11 bits may actually
be more power-efficient than low-resolution DACs.

Motivation: 为满足6G移动通信系统在复杂场景中的鲁棒和高速通信需求，减少系统开销。

Method: 利用EB表征电磁环境的静态特性，结合实时估计的局部CSI预测整个空间-频率域信道。设计了EB-P2WNet网络实现鲁棒预测。

Result: 在低信噪比和低导频比条件下，EB显著减少50%的导频开销，且对多用户干扰鲁棒，容忍3米定位误差，预测时间仅1.3毫秒。

Conclusion: EB-P2WCP方法在复杂场景中实现了高效、鲁棒的信道预测，为6G通信提供了低开销解决方案。

Abstract: To meet the robust and high-speed communication requirements of the
sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system in complex scenarios,
sensing- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin channel (DTC)
techniques become a promising approach to reduce system overhead. In this
paper, we propose an environment-specific channel subspace basis (EB)-aided
partial-to-whole channel state information (CSI) prediction method (EB-P2WCP)
for realizing DTC-enabled low-overhead channel prediction. Specifically, EB is
utilized to characterize the static properties of the electromagnetic
environment, which is extracted from the digital twin map, serving as
environmental information prior to the prediction task. Then, we fuse EB with
real-time estimated local CSI to predict the entire spatial-frequency domain
channel for both the present and future time instances. Hence, an EB-based
partial-to-whole CSI prediction network (EB-P2WNet) is designed to achieve a
robust channel prediction scheme in various complex scenarios. Simulation
results indicate that incorporating EB provides significant benefits under low
signal-to-noise ratio and pilot ratio conditions, achieving a reduction of up
to 50% in pilot overhead. Additionally, the proposed method maintains
robustness against multi-user interference, tolerating 3-meter localization
errors with only a 0.5 dB NMSE increase, and predicts CSI for the next channel
coherent time within 1.3 milliseconds.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于液体透镜的成像接收器，用于MIMO可见光通信系统，通过动态调整透镜参数降低信道增益的空间相关性，显著提升误码率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态透镜在动态条件下（如用户移动或接收器随机方向）适应性不足，液体透镜的动态调整能力可以解决这一问题。

Method: 开发了精确的数学模型描述信道增益，并设计了两种透镜调整方案（CLS和VULO）以优化误码率。

Result: 数值结果表明，在接收器随机方向方差为10°时，误码率从4×10−2显著降低至5×10−4。

Conclusion: 液体透镜显著提升了MIMO可见光通信系统的性能，尤其在动态环境下表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, a liquid lens-based imaging receiver is proposed for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC)
systems. By dynamically adjusting the focal length and orientation angles of
the liquid lens, the spatial correlation between MIMO channel gains is reduced,
leading to enhanced bit-error rate (BER) performance. Unlike static lenses,
liquid lenses offer adaptability in dynamic conditions, including user mobility
and random receiver orientation. An accurate mathematical framework is
developed to model the channel gains of the proposed system, and an
optimization problem is formulated to minimize its BER. Due to the complexity
of the resulting channel model, two lens adjustment schemes, namely, ($i$) the
CLS scheme, and ($ii$) the VULO scheme are introduced. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed liquid lens-based system offers substantial BER
improvements over conventional static lens-based receivers across a wide range
of random receiver orientation conditions. Specifically, at a random receiver
orientation variance of $10^{\circ}$, the BER is improved from $4\times
10^{-2}$ to $5\times 10^{-4}$ by employing the proposed liquid lens.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology plays a critical role
in future intelligent transportation systems, by enabling vehicles to perceive
and reconstruct the surrounding environment through reuse of wireless signals,
thereby reducing or even eliminating the need for additional sensors such as
LiDAR or radar. However, existing ISAC based reconstruction methods often lack
the ability to track dynamic scenes with sufficient accuracy and temporal
consistency, limiting the real world applicability. To address this limitation,
we propose a deep learning based framework for vehicular environment
reconstruction by using ISAC channels. We first establish a joint channel
environment dataset based on multi modal measurements from real world urban
street scenarios. Then, a multistage deep learning network is developed to
reconstruct the environment. Specifically, a scene decoder identifies the
environmental context such as buildings, trees and so on; a cluster center
decoder predicts coarse spatial layouts by localizing dominant scattering
centers; a point cloud decoder recovers fine grained geometry and structure of
surrounding environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves high-quality dynamic environment reconstruction with a Chamfer
Distance of 0.29 and F Score@1% of 0.87. In addition, complexity analysis
demonstrates the efficiency and practical applicability of the method in real
time scenarios. This work provides a pathway toward low cost environment
reconstruction based on ISAC for future intelligent transportation.

### [21] [Unifying Common Signal Analyses with Instantaneous Time-Frequency Atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05380)
*Steven Sandoval,Phillip L. De Leon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于瞬时时间-频率原子的方法，用于计算与常见信号分析相关的瞬时频谱（IS），并展示了如何通过统一框架将这些分析联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在先前的工作中，作者提出了一个通用的瞬时时间-频率分析框架，但未提供具体计算瞬时频谱（IS）的细节。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用瞬时时间-频率原子，将常见信号分析（如时域分析、频域分析、分数阶傅里叶变换等）统一为AM-FM分量分解，并基于二次chirplet模板推导IS的闭式表达式。

Result: 通过二次chirplet的两参数模型，将不同IS组织为一个二维连续体，并通过示例信号展示了闭式计算IS的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文成功地将多种信号分析统一到一个框架中，并提供了计算IS的具体方法，为信号处理领域提供了新的工具。

Abstract: In previous work, we presented a general framework for instantaneous
time-frequency analysis but did not provide any specific details of how to
compute a particular instantaneous spectrum (IS). In this work, we use
instantaneous time-frequency atoms to obtain an IS associated with common
signal analyses: time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, fractional
Fourier transform, synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, and
synchrosqueezed short-time fractional Fourier transform. By doing so, we
demonstrate how the general framework can be used to unify these analyses and
we develop closed-form expressions for the corresponding ISs. This is
accomplished by viewing these analyses as decompositions into AM--FM components
and recognizing that each uses a specialized (or limiting) form of a quadratic
chirplet as a template during analysis. With a two-parameter quadratic
chirplet, we can organize these ISs into a 2D continuum with points in the
plane corresponding to a decomposition related to one of the signal analyses.
Finally, using several example signals, we compute in closed-form the ISs for
the various analyses.

TL;DR: 提出了一种超低功耗的802.11b反向散射发射器，实现了射频能量收集、反向散射通信和位置/运动传感的多功能复用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过消除电池和外部运动传感器（如MEMS），实现微型化、无限制的设备寿命以及低成本制造和维护。

Method: 通过消除本地振荡器，利用双音入射波的二阶互调提取频率，突破WiFi发射器的微瓦功耗限制。

Result: 实现了低至-19 dBm的累积收集/传输/传感灵敏度，并通过采集电压作为接收信号强度（RSS）的代理实现位置/运动传感。

Conclusion: 该技术首次突破了WiFi发射器的微瓦功耗限制，为微型化和多功能集成提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, a sub-uW power 802.11b backscattering transmitter is presented
to enable reuse of the same incident wave for three purposes: RF harvesting,
backscattering communications and position/motion sensing. The removal of the
battery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables unprecedented level
of miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, low fabrication
and maintenance cost. The uW power wall for WiFi transmitters is broken for the
first time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its
frequency through second-order intermodulation of a twotone incident wave. The
two-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing
sensitivity down to Pmin -19 dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using
the harvested voltage as a proxy for the Received Signal Strength (RSS),
allowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s)
shared across tags in indoor neighborhoods.

Abstract: A four-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) for ultra-low-power
applications is introduced in this paper. The proposed circuit inclusive of
frequency compensation requires minimal transistor count and passives,
overcoming the traditionally difficult compensation of 4-stage OTAs and
bringing it back to the simplicity of 3-stage OTAs. At the same time, the
proposed circuit achieves high power efficiency, as evidenced by the >3.7X
(>11.3X) improvement in the large-signal (small-signal) power efficiency figure
of merit FOML (FOMS), compared to prior 4-stage OTAs (sub-1 V multi-stage
OTAs). Thanks to the lower sensitivity of the phase margin to the load
capacitance, the proposed OTA remains stable under a wide range of loads
(double-sided as in any 3-4-stage OTA), achieving a max/min ratio of the load
capacitance of >100X.
