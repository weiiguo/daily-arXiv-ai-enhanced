Quantifying low-concentration metabolites such as GABA ($γ$-aminobutyric acid) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral overlap. We investigate and validate deep learning for quantifying complex, low-SNR, overlapping signals from MEGA-PRESS spectra, devise a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Y-shaped autoencoder (YAE), and select the best models via Bayesian optimisation on 10,000 simulated spectra from slice-profile-aware MEGA-PRESS simulations. The selected models are trained on 100,000 simulated spectra. We validate their performance on 144 spectra from 112 experimental phantoms containing five metabolites of interest (GABA, Glu, Gln, NAA, Cr) with known ground truth concentrations across solution and gel series acquired at 3 T under varied bandwidths and implementations. These models are further assessed against the widely used LCModel quantification tool. On simulations, both models achieve near-perfect agreement (small MAEs; regression slopes $\\approx 1.00$, $R^2 \\approx 1.00$). On experimental phantom data, errors initially increased substantially. However, modelling variable linewidths in the training data significantly reduced this gap. The best augmented deep learning models achieved a mean MAE for GABA over all phantom spectra of 0.151 (YAE) and 0.160 (FCNN) in max-normalised relative concentrations, outperforming the conventional baseline LCModel (0.220). A sim-to-real gap remains, but physics-informed data augmentation substantially reduced it. Phantom ground truth is needed to judge whether a method will perform reliably on real data."}

Under the control of a central processing unit (CPU), multiple access points (APs) collaboratively perform multistatic sensing while providing communication service in a cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Achieving high sensing accuracy requires the collection of global sensing information at the CPU, which can lead to significant fronthaul signaling overhead due to the feedback of the sensing signals from each AP. To tackle this issue, we propose a collaborative processing scheme in which the APs locally compress and quantize the received sensing signals before forwarding them to the CPU. The CPU then aggregates the information from all APs to estimate the location and velocity of the targets. We develop a distributed vector-quantized variational autoencoder (D-VQVAE) to enable an end-to-end implementation of this scheme. D-VQVAE consists of distributed encoders at the APs to locally encode the received sensing signals, codebooks for quantizing the encoded results, and a decoder at the CPU for location and velocity estimation. It effectively reduces the amount of data transmitted from each AP to the CPU while maintaining a high sensing accuracy. We employ a collaborative learning-assisted scheme to train D-VQVAE in an end-to-end manner. Simulation results show that the proposed D-VQVAE network outperforms the baseline schemes in sensing accuracy and reduces fronthaul signaling overhead by 99% when compared with the centralized sensing approach."}

They are important mathematical objects in many areas of theoretical computer science, yet the best constructions so far have codeword length $m$ that is super-polynomial in $n$, for codes with constant query complexity and constant alphabet size.\n  In a very surprising result, Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (SICOMP 2006) show how to construct a relaxed version of LDCs (RLDCs) with constant query complexity and almost linear codeword length over the binary alphabet, and used them to obtain significantly-improved constructions of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs.\n  In this work, we study RLDCs in the standard Hamming-error setting. We prove an exponential lower bound on the length of Hamming RLDCs making $2$ queries (even adaptively) over the binary alphabet. This answers a question explicitly raised by Gur and Lachish (SICOMP 2021) and is the first exponential lower bound for RLDCs. Combined with the results of Ben-Sasson et al., our result exhibits a ``phase-transition''-type behavior on the codeword length for some constant-query complexity. We achieve these lower bounds via a transformation of RLDCs to standard Hamming LDCs, using a careful analysis of restrictions of message bits that fix codeword bits."}

To deal with this issue, in this paper, a novel waveform design is presented for the partial-time superimposed (PTS) ISAC system. At the base station (BS), a parameter-adjustable linear frequency modulation (LFM) pulse signal and a continuous communication orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal are employed to broadcast public information and perform sensing tasks, respectively, using a PTS scheme. Pulse compression gain enhances the system's long-range sensing capability, while OFDM ensures the system's high-speed data transmission capability. Meanwhile, the LFM signal is utilized as superimposed pilot for channel estimation, which has higher time-frequency resource utilization and stronger real-time performance compared to orthogonal pilots. We present an accurate parameter estimation method of multi-path sensing signal for reconstructing and interference cancellation in communication users. Additionally, a cyclic maximum likelihood method is introduced for channel estimation and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of channel estimation is derived. Simulations demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed parameter estimation algorithm as well as the improved channel estimation performance over traditional methods. The proposed waveform design method can achieve reliable data transmission and accurate target sensing."}

Nevertheless, because communication channels change rapidly, their distributions can shift over time, often making periodic retraining necessary. This paper proposes a zero-overhead online and continual learning framework for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) neural receivers that directly detect the soft bits of received signals. Unlike conventional fine-tuning methods that rely on dedicated training intervals or full resource grids, our approach leverages existing demodulation reference signals (DMRS) to simultaneously enable signal demodulation and model adaptation. We introduce three pilot designs: fully randomized, hybrid, and additional pilots that flexibly support joint demodulation and learning. To accommodate these pilot designs, we develop two receiver architectures: (i) a parallel design that separates inference and fine-tuning for uninterrupted operation, and (ii) a forward-pass reusing design that reduces computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively tracks both slow and fast channel distribution variations without additional overhead, service interruption, or catastrophic performance degradation under distribution shift."}

While traditional models often overlook vertical variations in signal behavior, this paper proposes a height-dependent propagation model using a helikite-mounted software-defined radio (SDR). We collected extensive measurement data across the 88 MHz to 6 GHz range in both urban and rural environments. As a case study to validate our methodology, we focus on the FM radio band, which allows us to use publicly available transmitter locations and transmit power levels to facilitate comparisons between analytical with measurement results. We identify a clear transition from non-line-of-sight (NLoS) to line-of-sight (LoS) regimes at a specific altitude threshold and propose an altitude-dependent path loss model that incorporates this transition. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the standard free space path loss (FSPL) model in complex urban topologies, providing a more accurate framework for altitude-aware spectrum prediction and management across emerging aerial wireless technologies and bands."}

Siegel", "Anxiao Jiang"], "title": "On the Height Profile of Analog Error-Correcting Codes", "comment": null, "summary": "In recent work, it has been shown that maintaining reliability in analog vector--matrix multipliers can be modeled as the following coding problem. Vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ are encoded into codewords of a linear $[n,k,d]$ code $C$ over $\\mathbb{R}$. For prescribed positive reals $δ< Δ$, additive errors of magnitude at most $δ$ are tolerable and need no handling, yet outlying errors of magnitude greater than $Δ$ are to be located or detected. The trade-off between the ratio $Δ/δ$ and the number of outlying errors that can be handled is determined by the height profile of $C$; as such, the height profile provides a finer description of the error handling capability of $C$, compared to the minimum distance $d$, which only determines the number of correctable errors. This work contains a further study of the notion of the height profile. Several characterizations of the height profile are presented, thereby yielding methods for computing it. The starting point is formulating this computation as an optimization problem that is solved by a set of linear programs. This, in turn, leads to a combinatorial characterization of the height profile as a maximum (or max--min) over a certain finite set of codewords of $C$. Moreover, this characterization is shown to have a simple geometric interpretation when the columns of the generator matrix of $C$ all have the same $L_2$ norm. Through examples of several code families, it is demonstrated how the results herein can be used to compute the height profile explicitly."}

While classical methods rely on predefined analytical bases like B-splines, implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative that use coordinate-based networks to parameterize continuous functions with implicitly defined bases. Despite their empirical success, direct comparisons of their intrinsic representation capabilities with conventional models remain limited. This preliminary empirical study compares a positional-encoded INR with a cubic B-spline model for continuous function fitting from sparse random samples, isolating the representation capacity difference by only using coefficient-domain Tikhonov regularization. Results demonstrate that, under oracle hyperparameter selection, the INR achieves a lower normalized root-mean-squared error, yielding sharper edge transitions and fewer oscillatory artifacts than the oracle-tuned B-spline model. Additionally, we show that a practical bilevel optimization framework for INR hyperparameter selection based on measurement data split effectively approximates oracle performance. These findings empirically support the superior representation capacity of INRs for sparse data fitting."}

Due to the broadcast nature of multi-user downlinks, communications are vulnerable to eavesdropping. DAM applies controlled per-path symbol delays at the transmitter to coherently align the multipath components at the intended user, enhancing the received signal power, while simultaneously creating delay misalignment at the eavesdropper (Eve). To mitigate sensing degradation caused by multipath propagation, we propose a two-stage protocol that first estimates the angle and then the delay of the line-of-sight (LoS) path after suppressing multipath interference. We derive the secrecy spectral efficiency (SSE) and the Cramer-Rao (CRB) of the target delay. Finally, we develop a path-based zero-forcing (ZF) precoding framework and formulate a max-min SSE design under CRB and power constraints. Simulation results show DAM significantly outperforms the strongest-path (SP) benchmark in terms of SSE, while meeting sensing requirements, since intentional delay alignment at legitimate users degrades reception at Eve."}

We present a detailed derivation for constructing an incomplete third-order Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) tensor from the faulty array signals via subarray partitioning, cross-correlation, and dimensional reshaping. Leveraging the tensor's inherent low-rank structure, an Alternating Least Squares (ALS)-based algorithm directly recovers the factor matrices embedding the DOA parameters from the incomplete observations. This approach provides a software-defined 'self-healing' capability, demonstrating exceptional robustness against random element failures without requiring additional processing steps for DOA estimation."}

In this letter, we investigate localization in PASS by jointly exploiting the received signal amplitude and phase information, unlike recent works that consider only the amplitude information. A complex baseband signal model is formulated to capture free-space path loss, waveguide attenuation, and distance-dependent phase rotation between the user and each pinching antenna. Using this model, we derive the Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to the user location and obtain closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the position error bound (PEB). A maximum likelihood (ML) estimator that jointly considers the received signal amplitude and phase is developed to estimate the unknown user location.

However, their practical deployment is fundamentally constrained by waveguide attenuation and line-installation requirements, which limit the achievable coverage range. To address this challenge, this paper investigates a wireless-fed pinching-antenna architecture that employs highly directional horn antennas to enable efficient coverage extension. Specifically, a full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay equipped with horn antennas is introduced between the base station and the waveguide input, which significantly improves the link budget in high-frequency bands while effectively eliminating self-interference. On this basis, we formulate a total power minimization problem subject to a quality-of-service constraint at the user equipment, involving the joint optimization of the pinching-antenna position, the relay amplification gain, and the base station transmit power. By exploiting the structure of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio, the optimal pinching-antenna position is first obtained in closed form by balancing waveguide attenuation and free-space path loss. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for the optimal relay gain and transmit power are derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms conventional systems without relaying and relay-assisted transmission with fixed antennas in terms of total power consumption."}
