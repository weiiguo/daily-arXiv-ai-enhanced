### [1] [An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15045)
*Homa Nikbakht,Yonina C. Eldar,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双基地MIMO的ISAC系统，用于检测URLLC消息并优先传输，采用DPC技术减少干扰，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中，ISAC技术需支持URLLC应用，如智能城市和自动驾驶，需在严格延迟和可靠性约束下优先处理时间敏感任务。

Method: 提出双基地MIMO ISAC系统，结合DPC技术减少eMBB和感知信号的干扰，并探讨两种解码eMBB消息的方法。

Result: 数值分析表明，基于DPC的ISAC方案在有限块长度下显著优于功率共享和时间共享方案，满足URLLC和感知约束。

Conclusion: 基于DPC的ISAC系统能高效平衡eMBB速率、URLLC可靠性和目标检测概率，适用于6G网络需求。

Abstract: In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and communication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving. Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station (BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and sensing constraints.

### [2] [MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers: Capacity-Achieving Architectures with Reduced Circuit Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15052)
*Matteo Nerini,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图论的微波线性模拟计算机（MiLAC）模型，设计了一种低复杂度的stem-connected MiLAC架构，显著降低了电路复杂度，同时保持了容量最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决巨型MIMO系统中硬件和计算成本高的问题，特别是完全连接的MiLAC电路复杂度随天线数量二次增长的限制。

Method: 提出图论模型设计低复杂度的MiLAC架构，优化stem-connected MiLAC并提供闭式容量最优解。

Result: 理论分析和数值模拟表明，stem-connected MiLAC在保持容量最优的同时，电路复杂度仅线性增长。

Conclusion: stem-connected MiLAC为高性能、可扩展的巨型MIMO系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: To meet the demands of future wireless networks, antenna arrays must scale from massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to gigantic MIMO, involving even larger numbers of antennas. To address the hardware and computational cost of gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from the digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming through reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on fully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via tunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving, their circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components, scales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of MiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC architectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a family of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while drastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize stem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that stem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that scales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance, scalable, gigantic MIMO.

### [3] [Linear and Numerical SDoF Bounds of Active RIS-Assisted MIMO Wiretap Interference Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15073)

Result: 提出的上下界在多种天线配置下一致，且下界优于现有基准。

Conclusion: RIS辅助的MIMO窃听干扰信道在SDoF性能上具有显著潜力，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap interference channel (IC) serves as a canonical model for information-theoretic security, where a multiple-antenna eavesdropper attempts to intercept communications in a two-user MIMO IC system. The secure degrees-of-freedom (SDoF) of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted MIMO wiretap IC is with practical interests but remains unexplored. In this paper, we establish both sum-SDoF lower and upper bounds through linear beamforming conditions and numerical methods. Specifically, our proposed lower bound is derived from transmission scheme design and corresponding solutions to the sum-SDoF maximization problem, formulated by linear integer programming. The solutions to this optimization problem addresses RIS element allocation for leakage and interference cancellation. The proposed upper bound is obtained by solving a nuclear norm minimization problem, leveraging the fact that nuclear norm serves as a convex relaxation of the rank function. For symmetry antenna configurations, we derive a closed-form lower bound. Extensive numerical simulations show that our proposed lower and upper bounds coincide across many antenna configurations, and our proposed lower bound outperforms the existing benchmark.

Abstract: Flag codes are a class of multishot network codes comprising sequences of nested subspaces (flags) within the vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, where $q$ is a prime power. In this paper, we propose a family of constructions for full flag codes based on partial spreads. The distances of this family include maximum distance (optimum distance flag codes), second-maximum distance (quasi-optimum distance flag codes), as well as other feasible values. The structure of these flag codes resembles that of a \textquotedblleft sandwich", consisting of one layer of companion matrix and two layers of partial spreads. Furthermore, we present an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes.

### [5] [LLM Agent for Hyper-Parameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15167)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进WS-PSO-CM算法在无人机通信中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前启发式超参数调优方法自动化程度低且性能不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一个LLM代理，通过迭代框架和模型上下文协议（MCP）自动调优超参数。

Result: 实验表明，LLM代理生成的超参数在最小和速率上显著优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: 具备PSO知识和WS-PSO-CM背景的LLM代理能有效找到高性能超参数。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

### [6] [In-Context Learning for Gradient-Free Receiver Adaptation: Principles, Applications, and Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15176)

Result: ICL通过利用导频信号和辅助上下文信息，实现了无线接收器的实时自适应。

Conclusion: ICL是一种高效且无需在线重新训练的自适应方法，适用于动态信道环境。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.

Result: 第一种方法在一般参数范围内优于已知结果，第二种方法在特定参数范围内达到最优率-失真权衡。

Conclusion: 本文提出的编码方案在网络通信中具有动态适应性和高效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of variable packet-error coding, which emerges in network communication scenarios where a source transmits information to a destination through multiple disjoint paths. The objective is to design codes with dynamic error-correcting capabilities that adapt to varying numbers of errors. Specifically, we first provide several bounds on the rate--distortion trade-off for general variable packet-error coding schemes. Then, we present two explicit constructions of variable packet-error coding schemes. The first construction uses higher-order MDS codes and provides a coding scheme that achieves a better rate--distortion trade-off compared to known results for general parameter regimes. The second construction is based on a variant of the repetition code and yields a coding scheme with an optimal rate--distortion trade-off, with respect to our bound, for certain parameter regimes.

### [8] [Golden Partition Zone: Rethinking Neural Network Partitioning Under Inversion Threats in Collaborative Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15412)
*Rongke Liu,Youwen Zhu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了在协作推理中如何通过模型分割抵御模型反转攻击（MIA），发现深层分割比浅层分割更能抵抗攻击，但需权衡准确率损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法集中在浅层保护，但会导致显著的性能损失，如何分割模型以最大化MIA抵抗力和最小化准确率下降是关键问题。

Method: 通过理论分析神经网络中的表示转换对条件熵的影响，实验验证深层分割（表示转换或决策层）对MIA的抵抗效果。

Result: 深层分割使均方误差增加四倍以上，显著增强MIA抵抗力；正标签平滑通过压缩类内方差进一步提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 决策层特征在增强反转模型下仍具韧性，辅助数据类型影响转换边界和重构行为。

Abstract: In collaborative inference, intermediate features transmitted from edge devices can be exploited by adversaries to reconstruct original inputs via model inversion attacks (MIA). While existing defenses focus on shallow-layer protection, they often incur significant utility loss. A key open question is how to partition the edge-cloud model to maximize resistance to MIA while minimizing accuracy degradation. We first show that increasing model depth alone does not guarantee resistance. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that representational transitions in neural networks cause sharp changes in conditional entropy $H(x\mid z)$, with intra-class variance (denoted $R_c^2$) and feature dimensionality as critical factors. Experiments on three representative deep vision models demonstrate that splitting at the representational-transition or decision-level layers increases mean squared error by more than four times compared to shallow splits, indicating significantly stronger resistance to MIA. Positive label smoothing further enhances robustness by compressing $R_c^2$ and improving generalization. Finally, we validate the resilience of decision-level features under enhanced inversion models and observe that the type of auxiliary data influences both transition boundaries and reconstruction behavior.

Conclusion: 无需预变换即可通过权重贡献偏序设计出权重分布更优的类极化码，为极化码构造提供了新思路。

Abstract: Polar codes are constructed based on the reliability of sub-channels resulting from the polarization effect. However, this information-theoretic construction approach leads to a poor weight distribution. To address this issue, pre-transformed polar codes, such as CRC-polar codes and PAC codes, have been employed. In this paper, we focus on the structure of polar codes without applying any pre-transformations and explore methods, guided by the weight-contribution partial order, to design polar-like codes with enhanced weight distribution, notably without employing any search or optimization algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate improvement over a range of codes both with and without pre-transformation.

Conclusion: 信号设计对基于机器学习的距离分辨率至关重要，Bessel信号为最优选择。

Abstract: We apply machine learning methods to demonstrate range superresolution in remote sensing radar detection. Specifically, we implement a denoising autoencoder to estimate the distance between two equal intensity scatterers in the subwavelength regime. The machine learning models are trained on waveforms subject to a bandlimit constraint such that ranges much smaller than the inverse bandlimit are optimized in their precision. The autoencoder achieves effective dimensionality reduction, with the bottleneck layer exhibiting a strong and consistent correlation with the true scatterer separation. We confirm reproducibility across different training sessions and network initializations by analyzing the scaled encoder outputs and their robustness to noise. We investigate the behavior of the bottleneck layer for the following types of pulses: a traditional sinc pulse, a bandlimited triangle-type pulse, and a theoretically near-optimal pulse created from a spherical Bessel function basis. The Bessel signal performs best, followed by the triangle wave, with the sinc signal performing worst, highlighting the crucial role of signal design in the success of machine-learning-based range resolution.

Conclusion: MPDD模型为RIS和SIM增强的MIMO系统提供了一种有效的信道建模方法，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: The doubly-dispersive (DD) channel structure has played a pivotal role in wireless communications, particularly in high-mobility scenarios and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), due to its ability to capture the key fading effects experienced by a transmitted signal as it propagates through a dynamic medium. However, extending the DD framework to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in environments artificially enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), remains a challenging open problem. In this chapter, a novel metasurfaces-parametrized DD (MPDD) channel model that integrates an arbitrary number of RISs, while also incorporating SIM at both the transmitter and receiver is introduced. Next, the application of this model to some key waveforms optimized for DD environments -- namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) -- is discussed. Finally, the programmability of the proposed model is highlighted through an illustrative application, demonstrating its potential for enhancing waveform performance in SIM-assisted wireless systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成式AI的TM-IRS参数设计方法，用于多用户OFDM系统的定向调制，通过GFlowNets高效学习参数配置，显著提升系统安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TM-IRS设计方法仅适用于单用户场景，无法满足多用户需求，因此需要一种高效的多用户参数设计方法。

Method: 将TM-IRS参数选择建模为确定性MDP，利用GFlowNets学习随机策略，以概率与奖励成比例的方式采样参数集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效提升多用户OFDM系统的安全性，且GFlowNets在极少量训练配置下即可收敛。

Conclusion: 提出的生成式AI方法在多用户TM-IRS设计中表现出高效性和优越性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: We propose a novel directional modulation (DM) design for OFDM transmitters aided by a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS). The TM-IRS is configured to preserve the integrity of transmitted signals toward multiple legitimate users while scrambling the signal in all other directions. Existing TM-IRS design methods typically target a single user direction and follow predefined rule-based procedures, making them unsuitable for multi-user scenarios. Here, we propose a generative AI-based approach to design good sets of TM-IRS parameters out of a set of all possible quantized ranges of parameters. The design objective is to maximize the sum rate across the authorized directions. We model the TM-IRS parameter selection as a deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state corresponds to a specific configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets are employed to learn a stochastic policy that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their associated sum rate reward. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the security of the TM-IRS-aided OFDM systems with multi-users. Also, despite the vast size of the TM-IRS configuration space, the GFlowNet is able to converge after training on fewer than 0.000001% of all possible configurations, demonstrating remarkable efficiency compared to exhaustive combinatorial search. Implementation code is available at https://github.com/ZhihaoTao/GFN4TM-RIS to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Multi-user millimeter-wave communication relies on narrow beams and dense cell deployments to ensure reliable connectivity. However, tracking optimal beams for multiple mobile users across multiple base stations (BSs) results in significant signaling overhead. Recent works have explored the capability of out-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless channels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user systems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense cell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing overhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to eliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in multi-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel OOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize multi-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB modalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially identified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and then tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence. Subsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network (BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for mobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to perform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the proposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS selection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the optimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS coordination efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 通过仿真研究验证了所提度量方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties. This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.

Abstract: The vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to signal interference have increased the demand for complementary positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems. To address this, South Korea has decided to deploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system as a complementary PNT solution. Similar to GNSS, eLoran provides highly accurate timing information, which is essential for applications such as telecommunications, financial systems, and power distribution. However, the primary sources of error for GNSS and eLoran differ. For eLoran, the main source of error is signal propagation delay over land, known as the additional secondary factor (ASF). This delay, influenced by ground conductivity and weather conditions along the signal path, is challenging to predict and mitigate. In this paper, we measure the time difference (TD) between GPS and eLoran using a time interval counter and analyze the correlations between eLoran/GPS TD and eleven meteorological factors. Accurate estimation of eLoran/GPS TD could enable eLoran to achieve timing accuracy comparable to that of GPS. We propose two estimation models for eLoran/GPS TD and compare their performance with existing TD estimation methods. The proposed WLR-AGRNN model captures the linear relationships between meteorological factors and eLoran/GPS TD using weighted linear regression (WLR) and models nonlinear relationships between outputs from expert networks through an anisotropic general regression neural network (AGRNN). The model incorporates terrain elevation to appropriately weight meteorological data, as elevation influences signal propagation delay. Experimental results based on four months of data demonstrate that the WLR-AGRNN model outperforms other models, highlighting its effectiveness in improving eLoran/GPS TD estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Flexible and efficient wireless resource sharing across heterogeneous services is a key objective for future wireless networks. In this context, we investigate the performance of a system where latency-constrained internet-of-things (IoT) devices coexist with a broadband user. The base station adopts a grant-free access framework to manage resource allocation, either through orthogonal radio access network (RAN) slicing or by allowing shared access between services. For the IoT users, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach based on double Q-Learning (QL) to optimise their repetition-based transmission strategy, allowing them to adapt to varying levels of interference and meet a predefined latency target. We evaluate the system's performance in terms of the cumulative distribution function of IoT users' latency, as well as the broadband user's throughput and energy efficiency (EE). Our results show that the proposed RL-based access policies significantly enhance the latency performance of IoT users in both RAN Slicing and RAN Sharing scenarios, while preserving desirable broadband throughput and EE. Furthermore, the proposed policies enable RAN Sharing to be energy-efficient at low IoT traffic levels, and RAN Slicing to be favourable under high IoT traffic.

Abstract: This paper studies a high-altitude platform (HAP) network supported by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The practical irregular placement of HAPs and RISs is modeled using homogeneous Poisson point processes, while buildings that cause blockages in urban areas are modeled as a Boolean scheme of rectangles. We introduce a novel approach to characterize the statistical channel based on generalized Beta prime distribution. Analytical expressions for coverage probability and ergodic capacity in an interference-limited system are derived and validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings show notable performance improvements and reveal the impact of various system parameters, including blockages effect which contribute in mitigating interference from the other visible HAPs. This proposed system could enhance connectivity and enable effective data offloading in urban environments.

Abstract: In practical systems, recorded analog signals must be digitized for processing, introducing quantization as a critical aspect of data acquisition. While prior studies have examined quantization effects in various signal processing contexts, its impact on differential microphone arrays (DMAs), particularly in one-dimensional (1D) first-order configurations, remains unexplored. This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on performance of first-order 1D DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical expression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D DMA has been formulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array performance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF), Front-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and null depth (ND). Simulation results reveal that beampattern shape remains structurally invariant across quantization bit depths, with quantization primarily affecting ND. DF and FBR remain constant with the varying number of quantization bits. Additionally, ND is shown to be frequency-independent; however, it increases with increasing quantization bit depths, enhancing interference suppression. The study also examines the effect of steering nulls across the azimuthal range, showing that ND degrades as the null moves closer to the source look direction, indicating reduced interference suppression.

Abstract: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequency bands, future wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused within a spatial region of finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in both the angular and range dimensions. This paper derives the beamdepth for a generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry influences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field beamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis reveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is maximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a square URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely constrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a sum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended EBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities.
