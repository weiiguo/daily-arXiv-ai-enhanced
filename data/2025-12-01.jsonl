Our contribution lies in establishing a rigorous methodology for characterizing system reliability under diverse propagation environments. Closed-form expressions for the block error rate (BLER) are derived by employing a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation of the spatially correlated UAV-to-user link, whose underlying independent diversity components are modeled as Nakagami-$m$ fading. This approach addresses both line-of-sight (LoS) dominant rural and probabilistic non-line-of-sight (NLoS) urban scenarios. Furthermore, a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is developed, revealing the fundamental diversity order of the UAV-to-user link. Based on this, we further address the practical issue of energy efficiency. A realistic energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, which explicitly accounts for the time and energy overhead inherent in the FAS port selection process, a factor often omitted in idealized models. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is then proposed to jointly optimize the key system parameters. Extensive numerical results validate the analysis and illustrate that while FASs can yield substantial power gains, the operational overhead introduces a non-trivial trade-off. This trade-off leads to an optimal number of ports and fundamentally different UAV deployment strategies in rural versus urban environments. This work provides both foundational analysis and practical design guidelines for FAS-enabled UAV communications."}

In this work, we propose two highly efficient configuration techniques, adapted to ultrawideband downlink scenarios, based on localized optimization over the IRS surface. Such techniques exploit the BS effect while taking into account for the shape of the transmitted signal spectrum. Simulations considering different geometrical setups and different signal spectra show how the proposed techniques are able to guarantee an increased signal power at the receiver with respect to classical narrowband-based solutions or techniques that perform a global optimization over the entire IRS surface."}

This paper proposes PowerSense, a real-time passive tracking framework that operates directly on the power of Channel State Information (CSI). Although CSI phase carries fine-grained information, its time-varying distortions require complex processing, which introduces additional interference during tracking. Instead, this work solely relies on CSI power for accurate sensing. We first remove all CSI phase offsets through a self-conjugate operation, yielding phase-independent CSI power. A cascaded Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is then applied to extract delay, angle-of-arrival (AoA), and Doppler features, followed by object detection, outlier removal, and continuous trajectory estimation via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). To enable fine-grained motion sensing, the estimated target positions are further used to extract refined micro-Doppler signatures. Using 3.1 GHz LTE and 5 GHz WiFi bistatic signals with a 20 MHz bandwidth, our indoor experiments achieve a median tracking error of 0.4 m, without performing any pre-deployment system calibration, while simultaneously extracting clear and unambiguous micro-Doppler signatures of the tracked target."}

Their capability to enhance spatial resolution within a fixed physical aperture makes fluid antennas particularly attractive for next-generation wireless deployments. In this work, we focus on the beamforming problem using a two-dimensional planar fluid antenna array. Since both narrow-beam and broad-beam patterns are essential in practical communication networks, enabling flexible beamforming through fluid antennas becomes an important and interesting research direction. We establish a unified and flexible framework that connects arbitrary beam-pattern synthesis with fluid-antenna port selection. The resulting formulation transforms beam-pattern reconstruction into a sparse regression problem, which is addressed using a tailored compressive sensing algorithm designed to operate efficiently with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Furthermore, to ensure physically consistent phase modeling in the desired beam, we introduce an iterative FFT-based phase retrieval method. Owing to its structure, the proposed phase-refinement procedure exhibits low computational complexity and rapid convergence, requiring only one FFT and one inverse FFT per iteration. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed flexible beamforming framework.

This paper presents a Diffusion-based Model and Data Dual-driven (DMDD) approach to estimate and detect multitargets and suppress structured jamming. In DMDD, the jamming prior is modeled through a score-based diffusion process with its score learned from the pure jamming data, enabling posterior sampling without requiring detailed knowledge of jamming. Meanwhile, the target signal is usually sparse in the range space, which can be modeled via a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework, and hyperparameter is updated through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. A single diffusion process is constructed for the jamming, while the state of targets are estimated through direct posterior inference, enhancing computational efficiency. The noise variance is also estimated through EM algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in structured jamming scenarios. The proposed DMDD algorithm achieves superior target detection performance, compared with existing methods."}

To facilitate Bayesian conditioning in such cases, one must therefore extend the probability space so that the new information becomes an event in this expanded space. Skyrms (1985) argues that Bayesian conditioning in an extended probability space on a product space of outcomes aligns precisely with the solution from Maximum Entropy. In contrast, Seidenfeld (1986) uses Friedman and Shimony's (1971) result to criticize Skyrms' approach as trivial, suggesting that alignment holds only under a degenerate probability model. Here, I argue that Friedman and Shimony's result must either (1) be a benign consequence of Skyrms' approach, or (2) pose a universal challenge to any method of extending spaces. Accepting (2) would imply that Bayesian conditioning is incapable of accommodating information beyond the probability space defined on the original outcome space."}

To tackle this problem, a two-stage algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the successive convex approximation (SCA) method is first invoked for minimizing the large-scale path loss, which is followed by the fine-tuning method for the phase alignment. 2) For the multiple IUs/EUs scenario, three multiple access schemes are considered, i.e., frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The corresponding multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) that simultaneously maximizes the minimum data rate and minimum harvested energy is formulated for ensuring users' fairness. To address this problem, we adopt the $ε$-constraint method to first convert the intractable MOOPs to single-objective optimization problems (SOOPs). Then, for the SOOP under each multiple access protocol, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and convex optimization methods are adopted for solving the pinching beamforming and resource allocation problems, respectively.

Specifically, we adopt a pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localization (PASCAL) system, in which multiple drones actively transmit signals towards the base station (BS). Upon receiving the signal, the BS estimates the drones' location parameters to reconstruct the channel matrix, which is then utilized for ZF and MMSE equalization. As the channel matrix is characterized by the estimated parameters associated with the target's location and the matrix inversion involved in ZF and MMSE further complicates the analysis, obtaining a closed-form SER expression becomes intractable. Thus, a tightly approximated SER expression is respectively derived for ZF and MMSE by using a hybrid approximation method incorporating Neumann approximation and Taylor approximation. Our analysis reveals several important design insights: first, the average SER of drone $k$ for both ZF and MMSE can be affected by the localization errors from all drones including drone $k$; second, the average SER of ZF is unaffected by the estimation inaccuracy of range, whereas the average SER of MMSE is influenced by it; third, ZF and MMSE is the most susceptible to the influence of angle estimation errors compared to the other localization errors; fourth, ZF is highly sensitive to localization errors and may be even worse than maximal ratio combining (MRC) under some conditions of significant estimation errors.

We call this approach TransCoder, alluding both to its function and architecture. TransCoder operates as a code-adaptive neural module aimed at performance enhancement that can be implemented flexibly at either the transmitter, receiver, or both. The framework employs an iterative decoding procedure, where both noisy information from the channel and updates from the conventional ECC decoder are processed by a neural decoder block, utilizing a block attention mechanism for efficiency. Through extensive simulations with various conventional codes (LDPC, BCH, Polar, and Turbo) and across a wide range of channel conditions, we demonstrate that TransCoder significantly improves block error rate (BLER) performance while maintaining computational complexity comparable to traditional decoders. Notably, our approach is particularly effective for longer codes (block length >64) and at lower code rates, scenarios in which existing neural decoders often struggle (despite their formidable computational complexity).

More specifically, an agent uses some useful data (database) $X$ to solve a task $T$. Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some latent sensitive attribute or secret $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies a bounded point-wise statistical parity, that is, such that for all realizations of the representation $y\\in\\cal Y$, we have $χ^2(P_{S|y};P_S)\\leq ε$. In contrast to our previous work, here we use the point-wise measure instead of a bounded mutual information, and we assume that the agent has no direct access to $S$ and $T$; hence, the Markov chains $S - X - Y$ and $T - X - Y$ hold. In this work, we design $Y$ that maximizes the mutual information $I(Y;T)$ about the task while satisfying a bounded compression rate constraint, that is, ensuring that $I(Y;X) \\leq r$. Finally, $Y$ satisfies the point-wise bounded statistical parity constraint $χ^2(P_{S|y};P_S)\\leq ε$. When $ε$ is small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the KL-divergence and mutual information. To design the representation $Y$, we utilize this approximation and show that the main complex fairness design problem can be rewritten as a quadratic optimization problem that has simple closed-form solution under certain constraints. For the cases where the closed-form solution is not obtained we obtain lower bounds with low computational complexity. Here, we provide simple fairness designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix.

While windowing is routinely applied to shape this trade-off, the choice is typically static. This paper proposes a new CNN method that uses two windowed range-Doppler periodograms and learns to fuse complementary views: one window optimized for resolution and one window optimized for sidelobe suppression. The design explicitly targets the resolution-sidelobe attenuation trade-off by exposing the model to complementary windowed maps and letting it learn when each is most informative. Numerical experiments show consistent gains over single-window CNN baselines, with better scaling in target density and greater robustness across different noise levels."}

Despite its potential, the practical application of CKM in beam training faces several challenges. On one hand, the user's precise location is typically unavailable prior to beam training, which limits the utility of CKM since its effectiveness relies heavily on accurate input of position data. On the other hand, the intricate interplay among CKM, real-time observations, and training strategies has not been thoroughly studied, leading to suboptimal performance and difficulties in practical implementation. In this paper, we present a framework for CKM-aided beam training that addresses these limitations. For single-user scenario, we propose a reward-motivated beam-potential hierarchical strategy which integrates partial position information and CKM. This strategy models the user equipment (UE) position uncertainty and formulates the hierarchical searching process as a pruned binary search tree. An optimal hierarchical searching strategy with minimal overhead is derived by evaluating the weights and rewards of potential codewords. Furthermore, a low-complexity two-layer lookahead scheme is designed to balance overhead and computational demands. For multi-user scenario, we develop a correlation-driven position-pruning training scheme, where sidelobe gains from inter-user interference are exploited to provide additional side information for overhead reduction, allowing all users to be simultaneously assigned their respective supportive beams. Simulations validate the superior performances of proposed approaches in advancing 6G beam training."}

However, the high mobility of LEO satellites necessitates fast and accurate beam steering to continuously serve ground devices. While large antenna arrays can address these challenges, strict constraints on power, size, and weight make such solutions difficult to implement. Furthermore, future non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) require high spectral efficiency, which motivates the adoption of in-band full-duplex (FD) systems. {To overcome these challenges, we propose an FD LEO satellite system, where the non-reciprocal beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (NR-BD-RIS) and multiple transmit and receive antennas are attached to the LEO satellite. The NR-BD-RIS reflects the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) signals by passive beamforming.} By incorporating non-reciprocal components into the impedance network of RIS, the NR-BD-RIS breaks channel reciprocity, facilitating simultaneous support for multiple beam directions. To cover a wide coverage, we propose a time-sharing scheduling framework where, in each time slot, the NR-BD-RIS simultaneously serves multiple DL and multiple UL ground devices. An optimization problem is defined to maximize the weighted sum-rate over the entire scheduling period. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NR-BD-RIS significantly performs better than both conventional BD-RIS and diagonal RIS (D-RIS) regarding DL and UL sum-rate performance under both single-user (SU) and multiple-user (MU) cases.

For such codes we propose a new syndrome-based decoding algorithm. It is well known that a syndrome-based decoding approach relies heavily on a parity-check matrix of a linear code. Nonetheless, Trombetti-Zhou codes are not linear over the entire field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$, but only over its subfield $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$. Due to this lack of linearity, we introduce the notions of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-generator matrix and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-parity-check matrix for a generic $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-linear rank-metric code over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{rn}}$ in analogy with the roles that generator and parity-check matrices play in the context of linear codes.

Traditional approaches that estimate individual component parameters face significant difficulties when the number of components is large, including permutation ambiguity, computational complexity from high-dimensional Fisher information matrix inversion, and model order selection issues. We introduce a novel framework based on low-dimensional sum-parameters that capture essential global characteristics of the signal ensemble. These parameters include the sum of amplitudes, the power-weighted frequency, and the phase-related sum. These quantities possess clear physical interpretations representing total signal strength, power-weighted average frequency, and composite phase information, while completely avoiding permutation ambiguities. We derive exact closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds for these sum-parameters under both deterministic and stochastic signal models. Our analysis reveals that the frequency sumparameter achieves statistical efficiency comparable to single-component estimators while automatically benefiting from power pooling across all signal components. The proposed Efficient Global Estimation Method (EGEM) demonstrates asymptotic efficiency across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, significantly outperforming established techniques such as Zoom-Interpolated FFT and Root-MUSIC in both long- and short-sample regimes. Extensive numerical simulations involving 2000 Monte-Carlo trials confirm that EGEM closely approaches the theoretical performance bounds even with relatively small sample sizes of 250 observations."}

In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$.\n  First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting.\n  Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied."}

Specifically, the power allocation maximizing the minimum data rate across users is derived for both the uplink and the downlink. To solve such optimization problems, two approaches are proposed, i.e., model-based and data-driven. The proposed model-based solutions for the downlink utilize successive convex optimization and the log-sum-exp approximation for the minimum of a discrete set, whereas ordinary techniques are employed for the uplink.

While recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication designs have achieved remarkable progress, the prevailing paradigm remains limited to static, modular AI substitutions. This approach fails to meet the core requirements of future wireless networks: the ability to continuously perceive, adapt to, and interact with the dynamic wireless environment. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Embodied Intelligent Wireless (EIW), a novel communication paradigm inspired by embodied intelligence, which redefines the communication node as an active, environment-aware, and evolving entity. EIW is built around an observation-decision-action paradigm, comprising: multi-dimensional observations for comprehensive awareness of the environment and system states, a unified decision module for orchestrating multiple wireless agents in an interpretable manner, and actions where wireless agents exert practical effects on both the environment and communication systems. Furthermore, two enabling technologies, wireless world models as well as self-update and self-evolution mechanisms, are introduced to support training efficiency improvement, counterfactual evaluation, and better adaptation. Unlike existing communication systems, EIW envisions future communication systems not as passive data pipelines, but as intelligent entities that continuously interact with and co-evolve alongside their environments. Finally, through simulations, we showcase the advantages of the proposed EIW paradigm and its enabling techniques in shaping the design of wireless communication nodes."}

The introduced methodology leverages the ReLLM framework to interpret both historical and real-time network data, enabling adaptive control of network slices. The ReLLM is founded on two specialized agents, one is responsible for proactively detecting service level agreement (SLA) violations by continuously monitoring and estimating slice-specific performance metrics, and the other one is responsible for dynamically reallocating physical resource blocks when the SLA violation probability exceeds a pre-defined threshold. The primary objective of this dual-agent design is to minimize unnecessary LLM inference calls while satisfying the SLA requirements of the slices, thereby improving computational and energy efficiency. The proposed ReLLM framework is implemented and validated on an end-to-end O-RAN testbed built upon open-source OpenAirInterface emulators. The experimental results demonstrate that the LLM approach with its reduced token consumption feature maintains a near-zero drop ratio for the low-priority slice while simultaneously satisfying acceptable latency performance for the high-priority slice.

Using 9,970 shots from StatsBomb's 2015-16 data and Football Manager 2017 ratings, we combine Bayesian logistic regression with informed priors to stabilise player-level estimates, especially for players with few shots. The hierarchical model reduces posterior uncertainty relative to weak priors and achieves strong external validity: hierarchical and baseline predictions correlate at R2 = 0.75, while an XGBoost benchmark validated against StatsBomb xG reaches R2 = 0.833. The model uncovers interpretable specialisation profiles, including one-on-one finishing (Aguero, Suarez, Belotti, Immobile, Martial), long-range shooting (Pogba), and first-touch execution (Insigne, Salah, Gameiro). It also identifies latent ability in underperforming players such as Immobile and Belotti. The framework supports counterfactual \"what-if\" analysis by reallocating shots between players under identical contexts. Case studies show that Sansone would generate +2.2 xG from Berardi's chances, driven largely by high-pressure situations, while Vardy-Giroud substitutions reveal strong asymmetry: replacing Vardy with Giroud results in a large decline (about -7 xG), whereas the reverse substitution has only a small effect (about -1 xG).

To mitigate pilot contamination, existing works jointly optimize pilot assignment and power allocation by assuming fixed pilot length, which fail to balance pilot overhead against the contamination. To maximize net-SE, we jointly optimize pilot length, pilot assignment, and power allocation with deep learning. Since the pilot length is a variable, the size of pilot assignment matrix is unknown during the optimization. To cope with the challenge, we design size-generalizable graph neural networks (GNNs). We prove that pilot assignment policy is a one-to-many mapping, and improperly designed GNNs cannot learn the optimal policy. We tackle this issue by introducing feature enhancement. To improve learning performance, we design a contamination-aware attention mechanism for the GNNs. Given that pilot assignment and power allocation respectively depend on large- and small-scale channels, we develop a dual-timescale GNN framework to explore the potential. To reduce inference time, a single-timescale GNN is also designed. Simulation results show that the designed GNNs outperform existing methods in terms of net-SE, training complexity, and inference time, and can be well generalized across problem scales and channels."}

A neural network designed for MRS quantification was trained using three distinct strategies: supervised regression, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation. These were compared against model-based fitting tools. Experiments combined large-scale simulated data, designed to probe metabolite concentration extrapolation and signal variability, with 1H single-voxel 7T in-vivo human brain spectra. In simulations, supervised learning achieved high accuracy for spectra similar to those in the training distribution, but showed marked degradation when extrapolated beyond the training distribution. Test-time adaptation proved more resilient to OoD effects, while self-supervised learning achieved intermediate performance. In-vivo experiments showed larger variance across the methods (data-driven and model-based) due to domain shift. Across all strategies, overlapping metabolites and baseline variability remained persistent challenges. While strong performance can be achieved by data-driven methods for MRS metabolite quantification, their reliability is contingent on careful consideration of the training distribution and potential OoD effects. When such conditions in the target distribution cannot be anticipated, test-time adaptation strategies ensure consistency between the quantification, the data, and the model, enabling reliable data-driven MRS pipelines."}

However, data-driven diagnostic methods often suffer from sparse fault labels and severe class imbalance, which limit their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a motor condition monitoring framework that leverages the general features learned during pre-training of two time series foundation models, MOMENT and Mantis, to address these challenges. By transferring broad temporal representations from large-scale pre-training, the proposed approach significantly reduces dependence on labeled data while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that MOMENT achieves nearly twice the performance of conventional deep learning models using only 1\\% of the training data, whereas Mantis surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by 22\\%, reaching 90\\% accuracy with the same data ratio. These results demonstrate the strong generalization and data efficiency of time series foundation models in fault diagnosis, providing new insights into scalable and adaptive frameworks for intelligent motor condition monitoring."}

This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates near-field channel estimation as a gridless super-resolution problem, eliminating the need for explicitly constructed codebooks. By employing a second-order approximation of spherical-wave steering vectors, the near-field channel is represented as a superposition of complex exponentials modulated by unknown waveforms. We demonstrate that these waveforms lie tightly in a common discrete chirp rate (DCR) subspace, with a dimension that scales as $Θ(\\sqrt{N})$ for an $N$-element array. By leveraging this structure and applying a lifting technique, we reformulate the non-convex problem as a convex program using regularized atomic norm minimization, which admits an equivalent semidefinite program. From the solution to the convex program, we obtain gridless angle estimates and derive closed-form coarse range estimates, followed by refinement under the exact spherical model using gradient-based nonlinear least squares. The proposed method avoids basis mismatch and exhaustive two-dimensional grid searches while enabling accurate joint angle-range estimation with pilot budgets that scale sublinearly with array size in sparse multipath regimes. Simulations demonstrate accurate channel reconstruction and user localization across representative near-field scenarios."}

Our dual-component model decomposes the ISAC channel into a target channel encompassing all multipath components produced by a sensing target parameterized by the target's radar cross-section and scattering points, and a background channel comprising all other propagation paths that do not interact with the sensing target. The framework extends TR38.901 via a hybrid clustering approach, integrating spatiotemporally consistent deterministic clusters with stochastic clusters to preserve channel reciprocity and absolute delay alignment for sensing parameter estimation. Extensive simulations across urban macro, urban micro, and indoor factory scenarios demonstrate that the model maintains communication performance parity with the standard TR38.901, validated through bit-error rate analysis obtained via simulated and measured ISAC channels and channel capacity assessment, while enabling sensing performance evaluation, such as target ranging error for localization and receiver operating characteristic curves for detection probability."}

However, recognizing targets under electronic countermeasures (ECM), especially the mainstream interrupted-sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ), remains a significant challenge, as HRRPs often suffer from serious feature distortion. To address this, we propose a robust HRRP recognition method guided by prior jamming information. Specifically, we introduce a point spread function (PSF) as prior information to model the HRRP distortion induced by ISRJ. Based on this, we design a recognition network that leverages this prior through a prior-guided feature interaction module and a hybrid loss function to enhance the model's discriminative capability. With the aid of prior information, the model can learn invariant features within distorted HRRP under different jamming parameters. Both the simulated and measured-data experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits stronger generalization capabilities when facing unseen jamming parameters."}

However, previous work has mainly focused on the identification of a single signal, overlooking the phenomenon of multiple signal superposition in practical channels and the signal detection procedures that must be conducted beforehand. Considering the susceptibility of radio frequency (RF) signals to noise interference and significant spectral variations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Feature Integration (HIFI)-YOLO framework for multi-signal joint detection and modulation recognition. Our HIFI-YOLO framework, with its unique design of hierarchical feature integration, effectively enhances the representation capability of features in different modules, thereby improving detection performance. We construct a large-scale AMR dataset specifically tailored for scenarios of the coexistence or overlapping of multiple signals transmitted through channels with realistic propagation conditions, consisting of diverse digital and analog modulation schemes. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of HIFI-YOLO in multi-signal detection and modulation recognition as a joint approach."}

Traditional scalar models often treat jitter as independent Gaussian noise, which makes it essentially untrackable, whereas real ADCs also exhibit temporally correlated (spectrally colored) imperfections. Moreover, spatial cross-correlations between channels in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ADCs are commonly neglected. This paper addresses the joint tracking and compensation of random, cross-correlated timing errors in ADC arrays by modeling jitter as a coupled vector autoregressive process of order one (VAR(1)). We propose a pilot-tone-based Kalman smoother to track and compensate the jitter, and simulations demonstrate substantial reductions in jitter-induced distortion across diverse scenarios."}

This paper tackles the problem of power control in user-centric cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems under EMF constraints. Specifically, the power allocation maximizing the minimum data rate across users is derived for both the uplink and the downlink. To solve such optimization problems, two approaches are proposed, i.e., model-based and data-driven. The proposed model-based solutions for the downlink utilize successive convex optimization and the log-sum-exp approximation for the minimum of a discrete set, whereas ordinary techniques are employed for the uplink. With regard to data-driven solutions, solutions based on both end-to-end architectures and deep unfolding techniques are explored. Extensive numerical results confirm that the proposed model-based solutions effectively fulfill the EMF constraints while ensuring very good performance; moreover, the results show that the proposed data-driven approaches can tightly approximate the performance of model-based solutions but with much lower computational complexity."}

In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$.\n  First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting.\n  Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied."}
