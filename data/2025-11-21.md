Conclusion: FRIS通过引入元件位置可重构性，为物理层安全提供了新的设计自由度，能够显著提升系统保密性能。

Abstract: The concept of fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) upgrades the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) paradigm by empowering its reflecting elements with positioning reconfigurability. This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method. Simulation results show that the proposed FRIS design significantly outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart and other baselines, demonstrating the substantial security gains by element positioning as the new degree of freedom (DoF).

### [2] [Neural Positioning Without External Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16352)
*Till-Yannic Müller,Frederik Zumegen,Reinhard Wiesmayr,Emre Gönültaş,Christoph Studer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部参考定位系统的神经网络定位方法，仅使用采集的CSI和机器人相对位移命令来训练定位网络，在Wi-Fi和5G系统中实现了接近最先进方法的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于CSI的神经网络定位方法需要从外部参考定位系统获取地面真实位置标签，这需要昂贵的硬件且在大面积区域难以获得标签。

Method: 使用商用机器人平台（如扫地机器人）采集的CSI和相对位移命令来训练定位网络，无需外部参考定位系统。

Result: 在三种真实场景（从小型视距区域到大型非视距环境）中评估，使用IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi和5G NR系统的CSI测量，实现了接近需要外部高精度地面真实标签的最先进方法的定位精度。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在大面积区域以低成本训练准确的神经网络定位功能，避免了对外部参考定位系统的依赖。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI)-based user equipment (UE) positioning with neural networks -- referred to as neural positioning -- is a promising approach for accurate off-device UE localization. Most existing methods train their neural networks with ground-truth position labels obtained from external reference positioning systems, which requires costly hardware and renders label acquisition difficult in large areas. In this work, we propose a novel neural positioning pipeline that avoids the need for any external reference positioning system. Our approach trains the positioning network only using CSI acquired off-device and relative displacement commands executed on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) robot platforms, such as robotic vacuum cleaners -- such an approach enables inexpensive training of accurate neural positioning functions over large areas. We evaluate our method in three real-world scenarios, ranging from small line-of-sight (LoS) areas to larger non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments, using CSI measurements acquired in IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi and 5G New Radio (NR) systems. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed neural positioning pipeline achieves UE localization accuracies close to state-of-the-art methods that require externally acquired high-precision ground-truth position labels for training.

Method: 使用PELT算法进行变点检测，但采用手动设置惩罚参数的方法，减少了输入参数需求，并提供了数据驱动的最小FO段长度设置方法。

Result: 在minniWECC模型测试中，计算时间减少了98%，同时保持了高估计精度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了强迫振荡检测的计算效率，为电力系统振荡监测提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper describes a new approach for using changepoint detection (CPD) to estimate the starting and stopping times of a forced oscillation (FO) in measured power system data. As with a previous application of CPD to this problem, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm is used. However, instead of allowing PELT to automatically tune its penalty parameter, a method of manually providing it is presented that dramatically reduces computation time without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the new algorithm requires fewer input parameters and provides a formal, data-driven approach to setting the minimum FO segment length to consider as troublesome for an electromechanical mode meter. A low-order ARMAX representation of the minniWECC model is used to test the approach, where a 98\% reduction in computation time is enjoyed with high estimation accuracy.

Abstract: An advanced emotion classification model was developed using a CNN-Transformer architecture for emotion recognition from EEG brain wave signals, effectively distinguishing among three emotional states, positive, neutral and negative. The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...

### [5] [Integrated Coexistence for Satellite and Terrestrial Networks with Multistatic ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15947)

Abstract: Tightly integrated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications and terrestrial integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are expected to be key novel aspects of the 6G era. Spectrum sharing between satellite and terrestrial cellular networks may, however, cause severe interference. This paper introduces a cooperation framework for integrated coexistence between satellite and terrestrial networks where the terrestrial network also deploys multistatic ISAC. Unlike prior works that assume ideal channel state information (CSI) acquisition, the proposed approach develops a practical structure consisting of pre-optimization and refinement stages that leverages the predictability of satellite CSI. In addition, a co-design of terrestrial beamforming and satellite power allocation utilizing a weighted minimum mean-squared error algorithm is proposed, and a target-radar association method designed for multistatic ISAC is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the performance of these integrated networks. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the overall performance approaches the interference-free benchmark as the number of spot beams and radar receivers increases, demonstrating the feasibility of spectral coexistence between the two networks.

Result: 该方法降低了计算复杂度，支持分布式实现，在功耗、用户容纳量和计算时间方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为IRS辅助网络中的联合准入控制和功率最小化问题提供了更高效和可收敛的解决方案。

Abstract: Joint admission control and power minimization are critical challenges in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted networks. Traditional methods often rely on \( l_1 \)-norm approximations and alternating optimization (AO) techniques, which suffer from high computational complexity and lack robust convergence guarantees. To address these limitations, we propose a sigmoid-based approximation of the \( l_0 \)-norm AC indicator, enabling a more efficient and tractable reformulation of the problem. Additionally, we introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and admission control, ensuring convergence to a stationary solution. This approach reduces computational complexity and supports distributed implementation. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods by achieving lower power consumption, accommodating more users, and reducing computational time.

Conclusion: 该模型可作为OSA事件级多场景诊断工具，同时有助于深入理解睡眠障碍中呼吸过程的机制及其健康影响。

Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder that is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. While existing diagnostic approaches can roughly classify OSA severity or detect isolated respiratory events, they lack the precision and comprehensiveness required for high resolution, event level diagnosis. Here, we present UT OSANet, a deep learning based model designed as a event level, multi scenario diagnostic tool for OSA. This model facilitates detailed identification of events associated with OSA, including apnea, hypopnea, oxygen desaturation, and arousal. Moreover, the model employs flexibly adjustable input modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG), airflow, and SpO 2. It utilizes a random masked modality combination training strategy, allowing it to comprehend cross-modal relationships while sustaining consistent performance across varying modality conditions. This model was trained and evaluated utilizing 9,021 polysomnography (PSG) recordings from five independent datasets. achieving sensitivities up to 0.93 and macro F1 scores of 0.84, 0.85 across home, clinical, and research scenarios. This model serves as an event-level, multi-scenario diagnostic instrument for real-world applications of OSA, while also establishing itself as a means to deepen the mechanistic comprehension of respiratory processes in sleep disorders and their extensive health implications.

Conclusion: 这项工作对于实现实用且可扩展的量子增强通信系统至关重要，为里德堡传感器阵列的多路复用架构开发提供了关键解决方案。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers have been seen as novel radio frequency measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it attractive for communications reception. However, current implementations of Rydberg array antennas predominantly rely on simple stacking of multiple single-antenna units. While conceptually straightforward, this approach leads to substantial system bulkiness due to the unique requirements of atomic sensors, particularly the need for multiple spatially separated laser setups, rendering such designs both impractical for real-world applications and challenging to fabricate. This limitation underscores the critical need for developing multiplexed Rydberg sensor array architectures. In the domain of conventional RF array antennas, hybrid analog-digital beamforming has emerged as a pivotal architecture for large-scale millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as it substantially reduces the hardware complexity associated with fully-digital beamforming while closely approaching its performance. Drawing inspiration from this methodology, we conduct a systematic study in this work on the design principles, equivalent modeling, and precoding strategies for low-complexity multiplexed Rydberg array, an endeavor crucial to enabling practical and scalable quantum-enhanced communication systems.

### [9] [Dynamic Multiple-Parameter Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform and its Intelligent Filtering Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16277)
*Manjun Cui,Ziqi Yan,Yangfan He,Zhichao Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态多参数联合时-顶点分数傅里叶变换(DMPJFRFT)框架，通过引入时变分数参数来实现动态图结构的自适应谱建模，在去噪和去模糊任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联合时-顶点变换只能为空间域和时间域分别分配一个分数阶，限制了其建模图信号复杂动态变化的能力。

Method: 提出DMPJFRFT框架，为每个时间步分配不同的分数阶，实现动态灵活的时空信号表示；开发了基于梯度下降和神经网络的两种滤波方法用于动态信号恢复。

Result: 在动态图和视频数据集上的实验表明，该框架能有效捕捉时间拓扑变化，在去噪和去模糊任务中性能优于最先进的图基变换和神经网络方法。

Conclusion: DMPJFRFT通过时变分数参数实现了对动态图信号的自适应谱建模，为动态图信号处理提供了更灵活有效的工具。

Abstract: Dynamic graph signal processing provides a principled framework for analyzing time-varying data defined on irregular graph domains. However, existing joint time-vertex transforms such as the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform assign only one fractional order to the spatial domain and another one to the temporal domain, thereby restricting their capacity to model the complex and continuously varying dynamics of graph signals. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dynamic multiple-parameter joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (DMPJFRFT) framework, which introduces time-varying fractional parameters to achieve adaptive spectral modeling of dynamic graph structures. By assigning distinct fractional orders to each time step, the proposed transform enables dynamic and flexible representation of spatio-temporal signal evolution in the joint time-vertex spectral domain. Theoretical properties of the DMPJFRFT are systematically analyzed, and two filtering approaches: a gradient descent-based method and a neural network-based method, are developed for dynamic signal restoration. Experimental results on dynamic graph and video datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively captures temporal topology variations and achieves superior performance in denoising and deblurring tasks compared with some state-of-the-art graph-based transforms and neural networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通信系统在处理联合通信与计算任务时面临性能限制，特别是在大规模路径损耗和波导内损耗方面。需要一种新的框架来同时传输通信比特流和计算数据，并改善上行传输性能。

Conclusion: 分段JCC-PASS框架在平均波导内传播增益方面显著优于传统PASS系统，为联合通信与计算应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: A joint communication and computation (JCC) framework using segmented pinching antenna system (PASS) is proposed, where both the communication bit streams and computation data are simultaneously transmitted via uplink communications. The segmented PASS design is used to yield the tractable uplink transmission, and to mitigate large-scale path loss and in-waveguide loss. Based on three operating protocols, namely segment selection (SS), segment aggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM), the joint transmit and receive beamforming problem is formulated: 1) The mean square error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated for computation-oriented cases. To address this problem, a low-complexity alternating optimization-minimum mean square error (AO-MMSE) algorithm is developed. This problem is decomposed into receiver-side and transmitter-side MSE subproblems that are iteratively optimized by MMSE receivers to obtain the closed-form solutions. It is mathematically proved that the segmented JCC-PASS framework significantly outperforms the conventional PASS for the average in-waveguide propagation gain. 2) The weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated for communication-oriented cases. To solve the decomposed receiver-side and transmitter-side MSE subproblems, the AO-weighted minimum mean square error (AO-WMMSE) algorithm is further developed. An auxiliary weight variable is introduced to linearize the WSR function and is alternatively optimized based on WMMSE to derive the closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed JCC-PASS framework achieves up to 70.65% and 45.32% reductions in MSE compared with conventional MIMO and conventional PASS, and ii) it reaches 87.70% and 51.35% improvements in WSR compared with conventional MIMO and conventional PASS, respectively.

Abstract: We present VersaPants, the first loose-fitting, textile-based capacitive sensing system for lower-body motion capture, built on the open-hardware VersaSens platform. By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Wireless Physical Layer Foundation Models (WPFMs) promise a new paradigm of universal Radio Frequency (RF) representations. However, these models inherit critical limitations found in deep learning such as the lack of explainability, robustness, adaptability, and verifiable compliance with physical and regulatory constraints. In addition, the vision for an AI-native 6G network demands a level of intelligence that is deeply embedded into the systems and is trustworthy. In this vision paper, we argue that the neuro-symbolic paradigm, which integrates data-driven neural networks with rule- and logic-based symbolic reasoning, is essential for bridging this gap. We envision a novel Neuro-Symbolic framework that integrates universal RF embeddings with symbolic knowledge graphs and differentiable logic layers. This hybrid approach enables models to learn from large datasets while reasoning over explicit domain knowledge, enabling trustworthy, generalizable, and efficient wireless AI that can meet the demands of future networks.

Abstract: Very wideband apertures are needed in positioning, sensing, spectrum monitoring, and modern spread spectrum, e.g., frequency hopping systems. Vivaldi antennas are one of the prominent choices for the aforementioned systems due to their natural wideband characteristics. Furthermore, tightly-coupled antenna arrays have been researched in the recent years to extend the lower band edge of compact arrays by taking advantage of the strong mutual coupling between the elements especially with dipole elements, but not with dual-polarized Vivaldi antennas. This paper presents a novel tightly-coupled dual-polarized antipodal Vivaldi antenna (TC-AVA) with -6 dB impedance bandwidth of 3 to 20 GHz. The tight coupling by overlapping the Vivaldi leaves is shown to extend the lower band edge from 3.75 to 3 GHz and 2.75 GHz, an improvement of 20% to 25% for both polarizations, compared with an isolated antipodal Vivaldi element.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: TFCDiff是一种在DCT域操作的扩散模型，用于去除动态心电图中的混合噪声，通过时间特征增强机制保持生理信息，在多个评估指标上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态心电图读数容易受到身体活动产生的混合噪声干扰，包括基线漂移、肌肉伪影和电极运动伪影，这会影响诊断准确性。目前多拍ECG段的去噪研究不足且存在技术挑战。

Conclusion: TFCDiff可在可穿戴ECG监测器中实现即插即用部署，适用于高运动场景，为临床诊断准确性提供价值。

Abstract: Ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) readings are prone to mixed noise from physical activities, including baseline wander (BW), muscle artifact (MA), and electrode motion artifact (EM). Developing a method to remove such complex noise and reconstruct high-fidelity signals is clinically valuable for diagnostic accuracy. However, denoising of multi-beat ECG segments remains understudied and poses technical challenges. To address this, we propose Time-Frequency Complementary Diffusion (TFCDiff), a novel approach that operates in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and uses the DCT coefficients of noisy signals as conditioning input. To refine waveform details, we incorporate Temporal Feature Enhancement Mechanism (TFEM) to reinforce temporal representations and preserve key physiological information. Comparative experiments on a synthesized dataset demonstrate that TFCDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across five evaluation metrics. Furthermore, TFCDiff shows superior generalization on the unseen SimEMG Database, outperforming all benchmark models. Notably, TFCDiff processes raw 10-second sequences and maintains robustness under flexible random mixed noise (fRMN), enabling plug-and-play deployment in wearable ECG monitors for high-motion scenarios.
