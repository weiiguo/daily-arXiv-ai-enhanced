Thanks to the\nsubwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying\nantennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information\n(CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit\nprecoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to\nboost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work\nproposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual\ninformation between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A\ntwo-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently\naccomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the\neigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two\nsub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter\nantennas and receiver antennas, respectively. By properly setting the precoder\nand the combiner as the eigenvectors from these two sub-eigenspaces, the 2DIF\npromises to generate near-optimal observation matrices. Moreover, we further\nextend the 2DIF method to the popular hybrid combining systems, where a\ntwo-stage 2DIF (TS-2DIF) algorithm is developed to handle the analog combining\ncircuits realized by phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that,\ncompared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed 2DIF and TS-2DIF methods\ncan achieve superior channel estimation accuracy."}

Two approaches, namely, model-dependent and model-free\napproaches, can be employed for this purpose. The model-dependent approach\nrequires explicit estimation of the physical channel parameters (path delays,\nDopplers, and gains) to obtain the I/O relation. Such an explicit estimation is\nnot required in the model-free approach, where the I/O relation can be\nestimated by reading off the samples in the fundamental DD period of the\nreceived pilot frame. Model-free approach has the advantage of acquiring\nfractional DD channels with simplicity. However, the read-off in the model-free\napproach provides an estimate of the effective channel only over a limited\nregion in the DD plane but it does not provide an estimate for the region\noutside, and this can affect the estimation performance depending on the pulse\nshaping characteristics of the DD pulse shaping filter used. A poorly localized\nDD pulse shape leads to an increased degradation in performance. Motivated by\nthis, in this paper, we propose a novel, yet simple, I/O relation estimation\nscheme that alleviates the above issue in the model-free approach. We achieve\nthis by obtaining a coarse estimate of the effective channel outside the\nmodel-free estimation region using a novel model-dependent scheme and using\nthis estimate along with the model-free estimate to obtain an improved estimate\nof the overall I/O relation.

A system where\nmultiple targets transmit uplink pilots to a single-waveguide PASS under a\ntime-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is analyzed. For the single-target\nscenario, our analysis reveals a unique mismatch between the sensing centroid\n(i.e., the optimal PA position) and the distribution centroid (i.e., the center\nof the target's prior distribution), underscoring the necessity of dynamic PA\nrepositioning. For the multi-target scenario, two target scheduling protocols\nare proposed: 1) pinch switching (PS), which performs separate pinching\nbeamforming for each time slot, and 2) pinch multiplexing (PM), which applies a\nsingle beamforming configuration across all slots. Based on these protocols,\nboth the total power minimization problem under a BCRB threshold and the\nmin-max BCRB problem under a total power constraint are formulated.

We analyze a monostatic setting where\nthe BS performs multi-target Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation while\nsimultaneously communicating with one of the targets. We assume that the BS has\nstatistical CSI about all AoAs, with less uncertainty in the AoA of the\ncommunication receiver. The communication receiver is assumed to have perfect\nCSI. Utilizing a Bayesian Cram\\'er-Rao Bound (BCRB) framework to characterize\nthe fundamental limits of sensing under minimum mean square error (MMSE)\ncriteria, we derive achievable BCRB-rate trade-off regions. Our approach\nintroduces a number of transmission strategies that share power across sensing\nand communication beams over a coherence time. Our analysis reveals that beam\nallocation strategies leveraging the principal eigenvectors of the\ntarget-specific sensing matrices minimize individual AoA estimation errors,\nwhile strategies balancing sensing and communication directions optimize joint\nestimation performance at the cost of individual accuracy. We demonstrate that\nleveraging updated BCRB-based sensing information for the communication\nreceiver, due to its lower channel uncertainty, enables significantly improved\ncommunication rates."}

Thanks to the\nsubwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying\nantennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information\n(CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit\nprecoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to\nboost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work\nproposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual\ninformation between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A\ntwo-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently\naccomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the\neigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two\nsub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter\nantennas and receiver antennas, respectively. By properly setting the precoder\nand the combiner as the eigenvectors from these two sub-eigenspaces, the 2DIF\npromises to generate near-optimal observation matrices. Moreover, we further\nextend the 2DIF method to the popular hybrid combining systems, where a\ntwo-stage 2DIF (TS-2DIF) algorithm is developed to handle the analog combining\ncircuits realized by phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that,\ncompared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed 2DIF and TS-2DIF methods\ncan achieve superior channel estimation accuracy."}

Chockalingam"], "title": "A Hybrid I/O Relation Estimation Scheme for Zak-OTFS Receivers", "comment": "Accepted in IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society", "summary": "In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain input-output (I/O) relation in Zak-OTFS modulation, which is needed for\nsignal detection. Two approaches, namely, model-dependent and model-free\napproaches, can be employed for this purpose. The model-dependent approach\nrequires explicit estimation of the physical channel parameters (path delays,\nDopplers, and gains) to obtain the I/O relation. Such an explicit estimation is\nnot required in the model-free approach, where the I/O relation can be\nestimated by reading off the samples in the fundamental DD period of the\nreceived pilot frame. Model-free approach has the advantage of acquiring\nfractional DD channels with simplicity. However, the read-off in the model-free\napproach provides an estimate of the effective channel only over a limited\nregion in the DD plane but it does not provide an estimate for the region\noutside, and this can affect the estimation performance depending on the pulse\nshaping characteristics of the DD pulse shaping filter used. A poorly localized\nDD pulse shape leads to an increased degradation in performance. Motivated by\nthis, in this paper, we propose a novel, yet simple, I/O relation estimation\nscheme that alleviates the above issue in the model-free approach. We achieve\nthis by obtaining a coarse estimate of the effective channel outside the\nmodel-free estimation region using a novel model-dependent scheme and using\nthis estimate along with the model-free estimate to obtain an improved estimate\nof the overall I/O relation. We devise the proposed estimation scheme for both\nexclusive and embedded pilot frames. Our simulation results using Vehicular-A,\nTDL-A and TDL-C channel models with fractional DDs show that the proposed\nhybrid estimation approach achieves superior performance compared to the pure\nmodel-free approach."}

These requirements call for an efficient ultra-low rate code\ndesign. In this work, we propose a novel coding scheme tailored for PUFs based\non Polar codes and a low-complexity version of automorphism ensemble decoding\n(AED). Notably, our serial AED scheme reuses a single successive cancellation\n(SC) decoder across multiple decoding attempts. By introducing cascaded and\nrecursive interleavers, we efficiently scale the number of AED candidates\nwithout requiring expensive large multiplexers. An aggressive quantization\nstrategy of only 3 bits per message further reduces the area requirements of\nthe underlying SC decoder. The resulting coding scheme achieves the same block\nerror rate of $10^{-6}$ as our baseline based on Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem\n(BCH) codes while requiring 1.75x fewer codeword bits to encode the same K =\n312 payload bits. This reduction translates directly into 1.75x less helper\ndata storage and, consequently, a smaller overall chip area."}
