### [1] [Adaptive Base Representation Theorem: An Alternative to Binary Number System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15099)
*Ravin Kumar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应基表示(ABR)定理和一种新型数字系统，作为二进制系统的结构化替代方案。ABR系统能以相同比特数唯一表示每个十进制数，并与现有压缩算法和纠错机制兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为数字计算机提供二进制系统之外的替代数字表示方案，探索更结构化的数据编码方式。

Method: 基于ABR定理构建新型数字系统，理论证明其编码能力与二进制相同，并验证与Huffman编码、算术编码、汉明码等现有技术的兼容性。

Result: ABR系统能够以相同比特数唯一编码与二进制相同的整数范围，且与现有数据压缩和纠错技术完全兼容。

Conclusion: ABR数字系统是二进制系统的可行替代方案，在信息理论和数字编码领域具有应用潜力，可能推动数字数据表示和计算设计的新方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Adaptive Base Representation (ABR) Theorem and
proposes a novel number system that offers a structured alternative to the
binary number system for digital computers. The ABR number system enables each
decimal number to be represented uniquely and using the same number of bits,
$n$, as the binary encoding. Theoretical foundations and mathematical
formulations demonstrate that ABR can encode the same integer range as binary,
validating its potential as a viable alternative. Additionally, the ABR number
system is compatible with existing data compression algorithms like Huffman
coding and arithmetic coding, as well as error detection and correction
mechanisms such as Hamming codes. We further explore practical applications,
including digital steganography, to illustrate the utility of ABR in
information theory and digital encoding, suggesting that the ABR number system
could inspire new approaches in digital data representation and computational
design.

### [2] [Outage-Aware Sum Rate Maximization in Movable Antennas-Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15292)
*Guojie Hu,Qingqing Wu,Ming-Min Zhao,Wen Chen,Zhenyu Xiao,Kui Xu,Jiangbo Si*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了可移动天线(MAs)支持的多输入单输出(MISO)系统，在延迟敏感场景下，基于统计信道状态信息优化天线位置和波束成形，以最大化中断感知的和速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在延迟敏感场景中，用户避免发送训练信号以减少延迟，基站只能依赖统计CSI进行数据传输。传统固定位置天线(FPA)系统性能受限，需要探索可移动天线的潜力来提升系统性能。

Method: 采用基于统计CSI的迫零波束成形设计，通过重要引理推导SINR的均值和方差，利用Laguerre级数近似得到紧致的SINR CDF闭式表达式，并开发投影梯度上升(PGA)方法迭代优化天线位置。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的方案相比传统固定位置天线和其他竞争基准方案具有显著性能优势。

Conclusion: 可移动天线系统在统计CSI场景下能够有效提升中断感知的和速率性能，提出的优化方法能够有效解决这一高度非凸问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the movable antennas (MAs)-enabled
multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems, where the base station (BS)
equipped with multiple MAs serves multiple single-antenna user. The
delay-sensitive scenario is considered, where users refrain from periodically
sending training signals to the BS for channel estimations to avoid additional
latency. As a result, the BS relies solely on the statistical channel state
information (CSI) to transmit data with a fixed rate. Under this setup, we aim
to maximize the outage-aware sum rate of all users, by jointly optimizing
antenna positions and the transmit beamforming at the BS, while satisfying the
given target outage probability requirement at each user. The problem is highly
non-convex, primarily because the exact cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each user is
difficult to derive. To simplify analysis and without comprising performance,
we adopt the statistical CSI based zero-forcing beamforming design. We then
introduce one important lemma to derive the tight mean and variance of the
SINR. Leveraging these results, we further exploit the Laguerre series
approximation to successfully derive the closedform and tight CDF of the SINR.
Subsequently, the outageaware sum rate expression is presented but still
includes complex structure with respect to antenna positions. Facing this
challenge, the projected gradient ascent (PGA) method is developed to
iteratively update antenna positions until convergence. Numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes compared to conventional
fixed-position antenna (FPA) and other competitive benchmarks.

### [3] [Rotatable Antenna Meets UAV: Towards Dual-Level Channel Reconfiguration Paradigm for ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15295)
*Shiying Chen,Guangji Chen,Long Shi,Qingqing Wu,Kang Wei*

Main category: cs.IT

<details>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is viewed as a key enabler for
future wireless networks by sharing the hardware and wireless resources between
the functionalities of sensing and communication (S&C). Due to the shared
wireless resources for both S&C, it is challenging to achieve a critical
trade-off between these two integrated functionalities. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a novel dual-level channel reconfiguration framework for
ISAC by deploying rotatable antennas at an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), where
both the large-scale path loss and the correlation of S&C channels can be
proactively controlled, thereby allowing a flexible trade-off between S&C
performance. To characterize the S&C tradeoff, we aim to maximize the
communication rate by jointly optimizing the RA rotation, the transmit
beamforming, and the UAV trajectory, subject to the given requirement of
sensing performance. For the typical scenario of static UAV deployment, we
introduce the concept of subspace correlation coefficient to derive closed-form
solutions for the optimal RA rotation, transmit beamforming, and UAV hovering
location. For the scenario of a fully mobile UAV, we prove that the optimal
trajectory of a UAV follows a hover-fly-hover (HFH) structure, thereby
obtaining its global optimal solution. Simulation results show that the
proposed design significantly improves the achievable S&C trade-off region
compared to benchmark schemes.

### [4] [Subverting Flexible Multiuser Communications via Movable Antenna-Enabled Jammer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15298)
*Guojie Hu,Qingqing Wu,Lipeng Zhu,Kui Xu,Guoxin Li,Jiangbo Si,Jian Ouyang,Tong-Xing Zheng*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究利用可移动天线(MA)技术来干扰可疑的多用户下行通信系统。通过联合优化MA合法干扰器的天线位置和干扰波束成形，最小化可疑通信系统的性能收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可移动天线技术能够通过自适应调整天线位置来重构无线信道，为系统性能提升带来额外的空间自由度。从安全角度出发，可以利用MA技术来干扰可疑的通信系统。

Conclusion: MA技术能够有效干扰可疑通信系统，通过联合优化天线位置和干扰波束成形可以显著降低可疑通信的性能收益。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology which can reconfigure wireless
channels via adaptive antenna position adjustments at transceivers, thereby
bringing additional spatial degrees of freedom for improving system
performance. In this paper, from a security perspective, we exploit the
MAenabled legitimate jammer (MAJ) to subvert suspicious multiuser downlink
communications consisting of one suspicious transmitter (ST) and multiple
suspicious receivers (SRs). Specifically, our objective is to minimize the
benefit (the sum rate of all SRs or the minimum rate among all SRs) of such
suspicious communications, by jointly optimizing antenna positions and the
jamming beamforming at the MAJ. However, the key challenge lies in that given
the MAJ's actions, the ST can reactively adjust its power allocations to
instead maximize its benefit for mitigating the unfavorable interference. Such
flexible behavior of the ST confuses the optimization design of the MAJ to a
certain extent. Facing this difficulty, corresponding to the above two
different benefits: i) we respectively determine the optimal behavior of the ST
given the MAJ's actions; ii) armed with these, we arrive at two simplified
problems and then develop effective alternating optimization based algorithms
to iteratively solve them. In addition to these, we also focus on the special
case of two SRs, and reveal insightful conclusions about the deployment rule of
antenna positions at the MAJ. Furthermore, we analyze the ideal antenna
deployment scheme at the MAJ for achieving the globally performance lower
bound. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes
compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and other competitive
benchmarks.

### [5] [ProxySelect: Frequency Selectivity-Aware Scheduling for Joint OFDMA and MU-MIMO in 802.11ax WiFi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15452)
*Xiang Zhang,Michail Palaiologos,Christian Bluemm,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: ProxySelect是一个用于802.11ax中OFDMA和MU-MIMO联合使用的可扩展、频率选择性感知的用户调度算法，通过代理速率和采样候选组生成来降低复杂度，实现接近最优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着WiFi带宽增长，信道频率选择性增强，传统窄带用户选择算法在802.11ax中效率低下，需要解决频率选择性带来的用户选择挑战。

Method: 将调度任务建模为整数线性规划，引入代理速率来近似ZFBF速率而无需立方复杂度矩阵求逆，并开发基于采样的候选组生成方案来限制ILP规模。

Result: 使用基于射线追踪的真实信道模型仿真显示，ProxySelect以显著更低的复杂度实现了接近最优的速率性能。

Conclusion: ProxySelect为802.11ax中的用户调度提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效应对频率选择性带来的挑战。

Abstract: IEEE 802.11ax introduces orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) to WiFi to support concurrent transmissions to a larger number of
users. As bandwidth continues to grow, WiFi channels exhibit increased
frequency selectivity, which poses new challenges for MU-MIMO user selection:
the optimal user set varies across frequency and is interleaved over subbands
(called resource units, or RUs). This frequency selectivity, coupled with the
complex subband allocation pattern, renders conventional narrowband user
selection algorithms inefficient for 802.11ax. In this paper, we propose
\emph{ProxySelect}, a scalable and frequency selectivity-aware user scheduling
algorithm for joint OFDMA and MU-MIMO usage in 802.11ax under zero-forcing
beamforming (ZFBF). The scheduling task is formulated as an integer linear
program (ILP) with binary variables indicating user (group)-RU associations,
and linear constraints ensuring standard compatibility. To reduce complexity,
we introduce a novel proxy rate--a function of individual channel strengths and
their correlations--that approximates the ZFBF rate without requiring
cubic-complexity matrix inversion. Additionally, we develop a sampling-based
candidate group generation scheme that selects up to $T$ near-orthogonal user
groups for each RU, thereby bounding the ILP size and ensuring scalability.
Simulations using realistic ray-tracing-based channel models show that
ProxySelect achieves near-optimal rate performance with significantly lower
complexity.

### [6] [Near-Field Imaging by Exploiting Frequency Correlation in Wireless Communication Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15459)
*Tianyu Yang,Kangda Zhi,Shuangyang Li,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种基于稀疏贝叶斯学习的近场成像方法，利用多频段无线通信网络和图像频域相关性，通过设计两种照明模式来提升成像性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在宽带无线通信网络下的近场成像问题，利用均匀线性阵列的近场信道特性和图像在频域的相关性，提高成像质量。

Method: 将图像恢复建模为特殊的多测量向量压缩感知问题，提出基于稀疏贝叶斯学习的解决方案，同时估计所有图像系数及其在多频段上的相关性，并设计两种照明模式优化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多频段近场成像问题，通过利用频域相关性和优化照明设计，实现了高质量的图像恢复。

Abstract: In this work, we address the near-field imaging under a wideband wireless
communication network by exploiting both the near-field channel of a uniform
linear array (ULA) and the image correlation in the frequency domain. We first
formulate the image recovery as a special multiple measurement vector (MMV)
compressed sensing (CS) problem, where at various frequencies the sensing
matrices can be different, and the image coefficients are correlated. To solve
such an MMV problem with various sensing matrices and correlated coefficients,
we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based solution to simultaneously
estimate all image coefficients and their correlation on multiple frequencies.
Moreover, to enhance estimation performance, we design two illumination
patterns following two different criteria. From the CS perspective, the first
design minimizes the total coherence of the sensing matrix to increase the
mutual orthogonality of the basis vectors. Alternatively, to improve SNR, the
second design maximizes the illumination power of the imaging area. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SBL-based method and the
superiority of the illumination designs.

### [7] [New generalizations of circular complex fuzzy sets and Gaussian weighted aggregation operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15605)
*Yelda Gülfırat,Mehmet Ünver*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的圆复q阶正交模糊集(CCq-ROFS)概念，统一了现有的圆复直觉模糊集和复q阶正交模糊集框架，并基于高斯函数构建了新的聚合算子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了统一现有的圆复直觉模糊集和复q阶正交模糊集框架，并实现更平滑和统计上有意义的模糊表示。

Method: 扩展高斯框架到CCq-ROFS，使用高斯三角范数和余范数构建高斯聚合算子，包括高斯加权算术和高斯加权几何聚合算子。

Result: 开发了新的CCq-ROFS概念及其高斯聚合算子，能够一致地整合隶属度和非隶属度信息。

Conclusion: 提出的CCq-ROFS框架为模糊建模和决策提供了更统一和统计上更有意义的表示方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of the circular complex $q$-rung
orthopair fuzzy set (CC$q$-ROFS) as a novel generalization that unifies the
existing frameworks of circular complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets (CCIFSs) and
complex $q$-rung orthopair fuzzy sets. If $q = 2$, the structure is referred to
as a circular complex Pythagorean fuzzy set, and if $q = 3$, it is called a
circular complex Fermatean fuzzy set. The proposed approach extends the
Gaussian-based framework to the CC$q$-ROFSs, aiming to achieve a smoother and
statistically meaningful representation of uncertainty. Within this setting,
new Gaussian-based aggregation operators for CC$q$-ROFSs are constructed by
employing the Gaussian triangular norm and conorm. Furthermore,
Gaussian-weighted arithmetic and Gaussian-weighted geometric aggregation
operators are formulated to enable consistent integration of membership and
non-membership information for fuzzy modeling and decision-making.

### [8] [Beyond-Diagonal RIS Under Non-Idealities: Learning-Based Architecture Discovery and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15701)
*Binggui Zhou,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的两层架构发现框架（LTTADF），用于在考虑电路复杂度的约束下，为非理想BD-RIS发现最优架构，解决非理想性和电路复杂度对性能影响的联合优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BD-RIS在非理想条件下的架构发现尚未研究，非理想性和电路复杂度如何共同影响BD-RIS性能尚不清楚，难以在存在非理想性的情况下实现性能-电路复杂度的权衡。

Method: 提出LTTADF框架，包含架构生成器和性能优化器，通过联合发现给定特定电路复杂度的非理想BD-RIS最优架构，有效探索大架构空间并避免陷入局部最优。

Result: 数值结果为考虑性能-电路复杂度权衡的非理想BD-RIS部署提供了有价值的见解。

Conclusion: LTTADF框架能够有效解决非理想BD-RIS架构发现的挑战，实现接近最优的性能优化解决方案。

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has recently been
introduced to enable advanced control over electromagnetic waves to further
increase the benefits of traditional RIS in enhancing signal quality and
improving spectral and energy efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.
A significant issue in designing and deploying BD-RIS is the tradeoff between
its performance and circuit complexity. Despite some efforts in exploring
optimal architectures with the lowest circuit complexities for ideal BD-RIS,
architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS remains uninvestigated. Therefore,
how non-idealities and circuit complexity jointly affect the performance of
BD-RIS remains unclear, making it difficult to achieve the performance -
circuit complexity tradeoff in the presence of non-idealities. Essentially,
architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS faces challenges from both the
computational complexity of global architecture search and the difficulty in
achieving global optima. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
learning-based two-tier architecture discovery framework (LTTADF) consisting of
an architecture generator and a performance optimizer to jointly discover
optimal architectures of non-ideal BD-RIS given specific circuit complexities,
which can effectively explore over a large architecture space while avoiding
getting trapped in poor local optima and thus achieving near-optimal solutions
for the performance optimization. Numerical results provide valuable insights
for deploying non-ideal BD-RIS considering the performance - circuit complexity
tradeoff.

### [9] [A Structured Family of Grassmannian Constellations via Geodesic Mapping for MIMO Noncoherent Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15070)
*Álvaro Pendás-Recondo,Enrique Pendás-Recondo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Grassmann流形测地线的新型结构化星座设计，用于MIMO非相干通信，具有单天线激活特性，能降低硬件复杂度和功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对MIMO非相干通信中缺乏信道状态信息的问题，设计结构化星座以利用Grassmann流形的几何特性，同时降低系统实现复杂度。

Method: 基于Grassmann流形的测地曲线构建星座设计，确保每个时隙只有一个发射天线激活，从而简化硬件实现。

Result: 在星座大小限制内，误码性能与最先进的非结构化设计相当，同时将最大似然检测器的计算复杂度降低了M倍。

Conclusion: 该结构化星座设计在保持良好性能的同时，显著降低了硬件复杂度和功耗，为MIMO非相干通信提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a novel structured family of Grassmannian constellations
for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) noncoherent communications over
Rayleigh block-fading channels, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver
has channel state information (CSI). The proposed constellation design is built
upon the geodesic curves of the Grassmann manifold, thereby exploiting its
underlying geometric structure. The resulting solution is limited in spectral
efficiency (with a maximum constellation size of $4M^2$ points, where $M$ is
the number of transmit antennas), targeting a rate in the range of $0.25$-$1$
bps/Hz. However, all space-time matrices resulting from this design exhibit the
remarkable property of having a single nonzero entry per row, meaning that only
one transmit antenna is active per time slot. This property significantly
reduces hardware complexity and implementation cost, while also lowering power
consumption, as only a single power amplifier is required for transmission.
Furthermore, within the constellation size limits, the proposed design achieves
error performance comparable to state-of-the-art optimization-based
unstructured designs, as validated through symbol error rate (SER) numerical
results. It also enables simple yet effective bit labeling, confirmed by
comparisons of bit error rate (BER) and SER, and reduces the computational
complexity of the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector for Grassmannian
constellations by a factor of $M$.

### [10] [Pulse Shaping Filter Design for Integrated Sensing & Communication with Zak-OTFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15195)
*Nishant Mehrotra,Sandesh Rao Mattu,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过各向同性正交变换算法设计的最优脉冲整形滤波器，该滤波器同时满足局部化、正交性和带宽/时间限制三个目标，在Zak-OTFS集成感知与通信系统中优于现有滤波器设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Zak-OTFS集成感知与通信框架中，脉冲整形滤波器的设计至关重要。现有滤波器设计（如sinc滤波器、高斯滤波器、RRC滤波器等）只能同时满足局部化、正交性和带宽/时间限制这三个目标中的两个，无法同时满足所有三个目标，这限制了ISAC系统的性能。

Method: 采用各向同性正交变换算法（Isotropic Orthogonal Transform Algorithm）来设计最优脉冲整形滤波器，确保滤波器同时具备局部化特性、正交性以及带宽/时间限制。

Result: 所提出的脉冲整形滤波器在数据检测（通信）和输入输出关系估计（感知）方面相比文献中现有的滤波器选择表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过各向同性正交变换算法设计的脉冲整形滤波器能够同时满足局部化、正交性和带宽/时间限制三个关键目标，为Zak-OTFS集成感知与通信系统提供了理想的滤波器解决方案。

Abstract: Zak-OTFS is an emerging framework for integrated sensing & communication
(ISAC) in high delay and Doppler spread environments. A critical enabler for
ISAC with Zak-OTFS is the design of pulse shaping filters. For sensing, a
localized pulse shaping filter enables ideal input-output (I/O) relation
estimates close to the physical scattering channel. For communication,
orthogonality of the pulse shape on the information lattice prevents
inter-symbol interference, and no time and bandwidth expansion enables full
spectral efficiency. A filter simultaneously meeting all three objectives is
ideal for ISAC. Existing filter designs achieve two of the above objectives,
but not all three simultaneously. For instance, the sinc filter is orthogonal
and bandwidth/time-limited, but is not localized. The Gaussian filter is
localized and bandwidth/time-limited, but not orthogonal. The RRC filter is
localized and orthogonal, but not bandwidth/time-limited. A recently proposed
hybrid Gaussian-sinc filter is more localized than the sinc filter and
bandwidth/time-limited, but is not orthogonal. In this work, we design optimal
pulse shaping filters meeting all three objectives via the Isotropic Orthogonal
Transform Algorithm. The proposed pulse shaping filters offer improved data
detection (communication) and I/O relation estimation (sensing) performance
compared to existing filter choices in the literature.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多维生理特征驱动的两阶段融合策略，有效提升了MIMO生物雷达的生命体征检测性能，为毫米波雷达在医疗监测领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the intensiffcation of population aging and increasing burden of chronic
diseases, the demand for vital signs monitoring is becoming increasingly
urgent. A key challenge facing current non-contact detection technologies using
millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is the low efffciency of multi-channel signal
fusion in array radar systems based on equal weighting. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes a vital sign enhancement detection method for
multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) bio-radar, driven by multidimensional
physiological characteristics, which overcomes traditional limitations through
a two-stage fusion strategy. Stage 1: Enhanced Vital Sign Detection Using
Single-Channel Signals Based on Physiological Characteristics. First, a chest
wall multi-scattering point model is constructed. For single channel
time-distance two-dimensional echo signals, effective range bins are selected
based on the respiratory/cardiac physiological frequency band energy ratio, and
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of respiration/heart signals is enhanced using
phase-aligned maximal ratio combining (MRC). Stage 2: Multi-Channel Fusion
Based on Organ Radiation Spatial Distribution Characteristics. The spatial
radiation characteristics of cardiopulmonary organs are introduced for the
ffrst time as the theoretical foundation for SNR-based channel screening,
channel attribute identiffcation, and multi-channel weighted fusion. Then, we
propose a template matching method to extract respiratory rate (RR) and heart
rate (HR) by adopting physical models of respiration and cardiac activities.
The experimental results demonstrate the existence of the spatial distribution
characteristics of organ radiation. In addition, we analyzed the impact of
distance and state on the algorithm from these two aspects.

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of the functionalities, algorithms, hardware
components, and performance characteristics of future integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) base stations (BSs) under realistic deployment scenarios
in controlled laboratory environments represents a critical requirement for
ISAC technology advancement. A primary challenge in achieving this objective
involves the emulation of multiple targets with arbitrary radar cross-section
(RCS), range, angle, and Doppler profiles for ISAC BS equipped with large-scale
antenna arrays using radar target simulator (RTS) with limited interface ports.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet highly effective and practical
conductive amplitude and phase matrix framework to address this fundamental
challenge. The core concept involves introducing a tunable conductive amplitude
and phase modulation network in the test configuration between the ISAC BS
under test and a RTS. Based on this structure, we subsequently investigate the
corresponding configurations for different sensing operational modes of ISAC
BSs, specifically the array duplex transmission and reception (ADTR) mode and
the split-array transmission and reception (SATR) mode. For experimental
validation, we design two distinct monostatic sensing scenarios to demonstrate
the framework capabilities across both operational modes. The first scenario
involves dynamic multi-drone sensing validation for ADTR mode operation, while
the second scenario addresses static single-drone sensing for SATR mode
validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
can accurately emulate the joint RCS, range, velocity, and angular
characteristics of multiple sensing targets within the conductive test
environment, highlighting its significant potential for testing applications in
sub-6 GHz ISAC BS development and validation.

aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, as it enhances the overall performance,
flexibility, and efficiency of such systems. To facilitate the collaborative
operations among UAVs, this paper proposes an ISAC solution based on the
pseudo-random time-division multiplexing (TDM)-multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW).
Specifically, a novel ISAC chirp waveform is proposed to modulate data in both
the delay domain and complex amplitude, while also possessing high-precision
sensing capabilities. To address challenges in the TDM-MIMO, we utilize the
pseudo-random antenna selection and compressed sensing algorithms, ensuring
that the maximum unambiguous velocity is not compromised. Moreover, by
employing a chirp-division multiple access scheme, we propose an
interference-free multiple antenna transmission scheme to achieve dynamic
allocation of time-frequency resources and multi-user transmission. Finally, we
propose a communication and sensing fusion-based dynamic iterative computation
scheme, simultaneously achieving data demodulation and sensing parameter
estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve ISAC
under the dynamic flight scenarios of UAVs. Meanwhile, the scheme outperforms
the mmWave-LoRadar in communication and sensing performance, yet its sensing
performance is slightly lower than that of the traditional FMCW. Under the
urban clutter modeling, the scheme still maintains favorable robustness despite
a certain degree of performance degradation.

Abstract: Epileptic biomarkers play a crucial role in identifying the origin of
seizures, an essential aspect of pre-surgical planning for epilepsy treatment.
These biomarkers can vary significantly over time. By studying these temporal
fluctuations, we can enhance their effectiveness in guiding surgical planning.
This research focuses on examining how circadian rhythms influence epilepsy
biomarkers and aims to determine the optimal times for their analysis. To
investigate the relationship between epilepsy biomarkers and circadian rhythm,
the sleep/wake states first need to be classified. After the biomarkers are
identified, they are compared across these states. A retrospective analysis was
conducted on intracranial electroencephalography data from patients with focal
epilepsy. The biomarkers spike, sequence of spikes, high-frequency oscillations
(HFOs), and pathological HFOs were identified through automatic detection. The
alpha/delta ratio was also calculated to distinguish between asleep and awake
stages. Data from 9 patients were analyzed, and the classification of sleep and
wake states was achieved with an area under the curve of 84%. All biomarker
rates were higher during the sleep stage compared to the wake stage.
Pathological HFOs and the sequence of spikes proved to be more precise
indicators regarding distance to seizure onset than spikes or HFOs. Unlike
previous studies that relied predominantly on long-term spike biomarker
analysis, this study is the first to utilize a comprehensive set of biomarkers,
including HFOs, spike sequences, and pathological HFOs, to enhance seizure
onset zone prediction. The rates of epilepsy biomarkers during sleep vary
considerably from those seen while awake, making sleep data analysis more
effective for accurately predicting the seizure onset zone.

Abstract: The Sixth Generation (6G) radio technology is expected to include local 6G
networks as a special use case, extending the capabilities of `generic' 6G
networks towards more demanding performance requirements. Reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a novel paradigm for next-generation wireless
communications, especially in the context of local 6G networks, enabling
advanced signal propagation control through intelligent phase-shift
configurations. However, in practical deployments, their performance can be
adversely affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources
and inter-RIS reflections (IRR) caused by signal reflections between multiple
colocated RIS units. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the joint
impact of EMI and IRR in a multi-RIS multi-cell system deployed within an
indoor factory environment. A detailed evaluation study is first carried out to
investigate their impact on system performance. System-level simulations
demonstrate that the joint impact of EMI and IRR degrades system performance
more significantly than their individual effects, particularly as RIS
dimensions and transmit power increase. To address these adverse effects, an
alternate optimization algorithm using the Riemannian conjugate gradient method
is then proposed. The novel algorithm optimizes the phase shifts of the RIS
elements considering the spatial correlation among their associated channels,
and is found to provide up to several orders of magnitude gains in terms of the
system sum rate and the outage probability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel and low-complexity atomic multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) receiver architecture assisted by a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS). By introducing RIS and utilizing pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM), the phase of the transmitted signal is effectively aligned
with that of the local oscillator (LO), thereby mitigating phase ambiguity and
substantially reducing both signal detection complexity and overall receiver
complexity.To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we
reformulate it into a tractable form by minimizing the Frobenius norm of an
equivalent matrix, which is efficiently solved using an Adam-based gradient
descent algorithm.

Conclusion: RAQ-MIMO卫星为下一代卫星网络提供了有前景的技术路径，在功率受限的长距离传输场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance advantages of Rydberg atomic quantum
(RAQ)-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellites for enhancing
direct ground-to-space uplink access.We analytically evaluate the impact of
Rydberg atoms on channel estimation by deriving closed-form expressions for the
mean-square error (MSE) and normalized mean-square error (NMSE). Based on the
estimated channels, we further derive lower bounds on the achievable data rates
for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) detection schemes.
Rigorous analysis demonstrates that RAQ-MIMO outperforms conventional
radio-frequency (RF) MIMO under both Rayleigh and satellite channel conditions.
Specifically, compared with conventional MIMO, RAQR achieves a ``squaring" gain
under Rayleigh fading, especially in long-distance transmission scenarios with
stringent power constraints. In contrast, under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated
satellite channels, this gain saturates as channel-estimation benefits
diminish, with the remaining improvement primarily arising from the normalized
noise background. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results and
show that the performance gains of RAQ-MIMO satellites translate into smaller
antenna apertures, lower transmit power, and longer communication ranges,
thereby paving the way for next-generation satellite networks.

Conclusion: 通过将RAQR与SWIPT-MIMO集成，基站能够可靠检测仅靠收集能量供电的物联网设备的弱上行信号，实现无电池通信。

Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a hybrid simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT)-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
architecture, where the base station (BS) uses a conventional RF transmitter
for downlink transmission and a Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQR) for
receiving uplink signal from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To fully exploit
this integration, we jointly design the transmission scheme and the
power-splitting strategy to maximize the sum rate, which leads to a non-convex
problem. To address this challenge, we first derive closed-form lower bounds on
the uplink achievable rates for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing
(ZF), as well as on the downlink rate and harvested energy for maximum ratio
transmission (MRT) and ZF precoding. Building upon these bounds, we propose an
iterative algorithm relying on the best monomial approximation and geometric
programming (GP) to solve the non-convex problem. Finally, simulations validate
the tightness of our derived lower bounds and demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes. Importantly, by integrating RAQR
with SWIPT-enabled MIMO, the BS can reliably detect weak uplink signals from
IoT devices powered only by harvested energy, enabling battery-free
communication.

Abstract: This work addresses the radio resource management (RRM) design in downlink
full-duplex integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, jointly
optimizing timeslot allocation and beam selection under imperfect
self-interference cancellation. Timeslot allocation governs the distribution of
discrete channel uses between sensing and communication tasks, while beam
selection determines transmit and receive directions along with adaptive
beamwidths. The joint design leads to a semi-infinite, nonconvex mixed-integer
nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve. To overcome this, we
develop a tailored reformulation strategy that transforms the problem into a
tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling globally optimal
solutions. Our approach provides insights into the coordinated optimization of
timeslot allocation and beam selection, enhancing the efficiency of full-duplex
ISAC systems while ensuring resilience against residual self-interference.
