In the\nsecond stage, delays are estimated by applying the discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) and Prony's method to each Doppler component obtained in the first stage.\nThe proposed method can accurately estimate up to N-1 delay-Doppler parameters\nunder noiseless conditions.

To address this, this paper presents a channel modeling framework for\nXL-MIMO systems that incorporates both near-field and SNS features, adopted by\n3GPP. For the near-field propagation feature, the framework models the\ndistances from the base station (BS) and user equipment to the spherical-wave\nsources associated with clusters. These distances are used to characterize\nelement-wise variations of path parameters, such as nonlinear changes in phase\nand angle. To capture the effect of SNS at the BS side, a stochastic-based\napproach is proposed to model SNS caused by incomplete scattering, by\nestablishing power attenuation factors from visibility probability and\nvisibility region to characterize antenna element-wise path power variation. In\naddition, a physical blocker-based approach is introduced to model SNS effects\ncaused by partial blockage. Finally, a simulation framework for near-field and\nSNS is developed within the structure of the existing 3GPP channel model.\nPerformance evaluations demonstrate that the near-field model captures higher\nchannel capacity potential compared to the far-field model.

However, in high-mobility scenarios, OFDM\nsuffers from inter-carrier interference (ICI), and its reliance on dense pilot\npatterns and cyclic prefixes significantly reduces spectral efficiency. In this\nwork, we propose Deep-OFDM: a learnable modulation framework that augments\ntraditional OFDM by incorporating neural parameterization. Instead of mapping\neach symbol to a fixed resource element, Deep-OFDM spreads information across\nthe OFDM grid using a convolutional neural network modulator. This modulator is\njointly optimized with a neural receiver through end-to-end training, enabling\nthe system to adapt to time-varying channels without relying on explicit\nchannel estimation. Deep-OFDM outperforms conventional OFDM when paired with\nneural receiver baselines, particularly in pilot-sparse and pilotless regimes,\nachieving substantial gains in BLER and goodput, especially at high Doppler\nfrequencies. In the pilotless setting, the neural modulator learns a low-rank\nstructure that resembles a superimposed pilot, effectively enabling reliable\ncommunication without explicit overhead.

Motivated by a recent\ndiscovery that certain wireless network settings benefit significantly from\nnon-signaling (NS) correlations, various generalizations are considered. First,\nit is shown that for a point to point discrete memoryless channel with a\nnon-causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the NS-assisted\nShannon capacity matches the classical (without NS assistance) capacity of the\nchannel for the setting where the state is also made available to the receiver.\nThe key insight is summarized as 'virtual teleportation of CSIT via\nNS-assistance' and is supported by further results as follows. For a discrete\nmemoryless 2-user broadcast channel (BC), the Shannon capacity region with\nNS-assistance available only between the transmitter and User 1, is found next.\nConsistent with the aforementioned key insight, the result matches the\nclassical capacity region for the setting where the desired message of User 2\nis made available in advance as side-information to User 1.

Traditional\nwireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference,\nachieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability\nto characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated\nsignificant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional\ninference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the\nerror progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems,\ngenerative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased\nattention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using\ndiffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models,\nwe can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate\ntraditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the\ndiffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the\ndiffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying\nnoise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing\ntraining and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot\ndensities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces\nchannel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading\ndeep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in\nlow-pilot conditions.

Suppose there are $h\\geq1$ failed nodes\nin a rack (called the host rack). Then together with its surviving nodes, the\nhost rack downloads recovery data from $\\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its\nfailed nodes. In this paper, we focus on studying the rack-aware minimum\nstorage generating (MSR) codes for repairing $h$ failed nodes within the same\nrack. By using the coupled-layer construction with the alignment technique, we\nconstruct the first class of rack-aware MSR codes for all\n$\\bar{k}+1\\leq\\bar{d}\\leq\\bar{n}-1$ which achieve the small sub-packetization\n$l=\\bar{s}^{\\lceil\\bar{n}/\\bar{s}\\rceil}$ where the field size $q$ increases\nlinearly with $n$ and $\\bar{s}=\\bar{d}-\\bar{k}+1$.

Analytical expressions are derived for several standard\narray geometries to enable the design of the large antenna arrays for given\nsystem requirements. First, the near-field beam focusing is analyzed and the\nminimum beamdepth is observed to rapidly saturate to a low asymptotic limit as\nthe array aperture increases. In contrast, the near-field region span is shown\nto scale quadratically with the array aperture.

However, the bandwidth of these links is limited, and thus,\npresents challenges to the applicability of CF-mMIMO, especially with an\never-increasing number of users. To address this, we propose a method based on\nvariational Bayesian (VB) inference for performing the JED process, where the\nAPs forward low-resolution quantized versions of the signals to the CPU. We\nconsider two approaches: \\emph{quantization-and-estimation} (Q-E) and\n\\emph{estimation-and-quantization} (E-Q). In the Q-E approach, each AP uses a\nlow-bit quantizer to quantize the signal before forwarding it to the CPU, while\nin the E-Q approach, each AP first performs local channel estimation and then\nsends a low-bit quantized version of the estimated channel to the CPU. We\nevaluate the performance of our VB-based approach under perfect fronthaul link\n(PFL) with unquantized received signals, Q-E, and E-Q in terms of symbol error\nrate (SER), normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the channel estimation,\ncomputational complexity, and fronthaul signaling overhead.

In particular, when the\ncondition number of the covariance matrix approaches 1, the approximation error\napproaches 0. In addition, based on the proposed approximation, a new\nclassification algorithm called Adaptive Regularized ReduNet (AR-ReduNet) is\nderived by applying the approximation to ReduNet, which is a white-box\nclassification network oriented from Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR$^2$)\nprinciple.

The same technique produces, with\nprobability at least $1-2^{-n}$, a code correcting $t$ adversarial deletions\nwith redundancy $\\sim (2t+1)\\log n$, nearly matching the existential redundancy\nof $\\sim 2t\\log n$.\n  The common idea behind these results is to reduce the hash size by modding by\na prime chosen (randomly) from a small subset, and including a small encoding\nof the prime in the hash.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5728\u2018\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u578b\u2019\u4e0b\u7684\u5220\u9664\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u6784\u5efa\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u968f\u673a\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5220\u9664\u7801\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u54c8\u5e0c\u5927\u5c0f\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u5f0f\u9057\u5fd8\u7801\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5220\u9664\u7801\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u9057\u5fd8\u7801\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5220\u9664\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u81ea\u8eab\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5220\u9664\u7801\u7684\u6784\u9020\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}
