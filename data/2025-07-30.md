### [1] [DOA Estimation via Continuous Aperture Arrays: MUSIC and CRLB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21347)
*Haonan Si,Zhaolin Wang,Xiansheng Guo,Jin Zhang,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了使用连续孔径阵列（CAPA）进行方向到达（DOA）估计，提出了一种新的MUSIC算法，显著提高了估计精度并降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统空间离散阵列（SPDA）在DOA估计中自由度有限，而CAPA虽然提供了更高的自由度，但其连续信号特性使得传统算法无法直接应用。

Method: 提出了一种新的MUSIC算法，通过连续-离散变换实现连续算子的特征分解，并利用高斯-勒让德积分近似MUSIC谱以降低计算复杂度。

Result: 理论分析和数值结果表明，CAPA显著提高了DOA估计精度，且提出的MUSIC算法在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了接近最优的估计性能。

Conclusion: CAPA结合新MUSIC算法在DOA估计中表现出优越性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using continuous aperture array (CAPA)
is studied. Compared to the conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), CAPA
significantly enhances the spatial degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) for DOA
estimation, but its infinite-dimensional continuous signals render the
conventional estimation algorithm non-applicable. To address this challenge, a
new multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is proposed for CAPAs. In
particular, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation is proposed to
facilitate the eigendecomposition of continuous operators. Subsequently, the
MUSIC spectrum is accurately approximated using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature,
effectively reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DOA estimation using CAPAs are analyzed
for both cases with and without priori knowledge of snapshot signals. It is
theoretically proved that CAPAs significantly improve the DOA estimation
accuracy compared to traditional SPDAs. Numerical results further validate this
insight and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MUSIC algorithm for
CAPA. The proposed method achieves near-optimal estimation performance while
maintaining a low computational complexity.

### [2] [Transmission With Machine Language Tokens: A Paradigm for Task-Oriented Agent Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21454)
*Zhuoran Xiao,Chenhui Ye,Yijia Feng,Yunbo Hu,Tianyu Jiao,Liyu Cai,Guangyi Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种面向任务的多模态代理通信系统，通过专用机器语言和联合编码方案提升传输效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型基础模型的快速发展，未来生产过程中代理将成为主要参与者，需要一种新型的AI原生通信系统。现有大型语言模型输出的人类语言对代理通信不够高效。

Method: 利用原始LLM学习专用机器语言，训练多模态LLM理解任务并提取信息，采用联合令牌和信道编码（JTCC）压缩令牌序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法降低了传输开销并提高了准确性，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的系统为代理通信提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement in large foundation models is propelling the paradigm
shifts across various industries. One significant change is that agents,
instead of traditional machines or humans, will be the primary participants in
the future production process, which consequently requires a novel AI-native
communication system tailored for agent communications. Integrating the ability
of large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a
potential approach. However, the output of existing LLM is human language,
which is highly constrained and sub-optimal for agent-type communication. In
this paper, we innovatively propose a task-oriented agent communication system.
Specifically, we leverage the original LLM to learn a specialized machine
language represented by token embeddings. Simultaneously, a multi-modal LLM is
trained to comprehend the application task and to extract essential implicit
information from multi-modal inputs, subsequently expressing it using machine
language tokens. This representation is significantly more efficient for
transmission over the air interface. Furthermore, to reduce transmission
overhead, we introduce a joint token and channel coding (JTCC) scheme that
compresses the token sequence by exploiting its sparsity while enhancing
robustness against channel noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach reduces transmission overhead for downstream tasks while enhancing
accuracy relative to the SOTA methods.

### [3] [Two-Dimensional Nonseparable Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21511)
*Daxiang Li,Zhichao Zhang,Wei Yao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的2D非可分离分数傅里叶变换（NSFRFT），解决了现有2D FRFT方法的局限性，并在图像加密、去噪等应用中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D FRFT方法在理论统一性、处理非可分离信号及保持与2D Wigner分布的旋转关系方面存在不足，限制了其在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 提出2D NSFRFT，具有四个自由度，包含现有2D FRFT方法为特例，并推导其性质及三种离散算法，其中两种为快速算法。

Result: 数值模拟和实验表明，2D NSFRFT在图像加密、解密、滤波和去噪等应用中性能优越。

Conclusion: 2D NSFRFT是一种更通用的2D FRFT定义，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在实际应用中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) generalizes the
1D Fourier transform, offering significant advantages in time-frequency
analysis of non-stationary signals. To extend the benefits of the 1D FRFT to
higher-dimensional signals, 2D FRFTs, such as the 2D separable FRFT (SFRFT),
gyrator transform (GT), and coupled FRFT (CFRFT), have been developed. However,
existing 2D FRFTs suffer from several limitations: (1) a lack of theoretical
uniformity and general applicability, (2) an inability to handle 2D
non-stationary signals with nonseparable terms, and (3) failure to maintain a
consistent 4D rotational relationship with the 2D Wigner distribution (WD),
which is essential for ensuring geometric consistency and symmetry in
time-frequency analysis. These limitations restrict the methods' performance in
practical applications, such as radar, communication, sonar, and optical
imaging, in which nonseparable terms frequently arise. To address these
challenges, we introduce a more general definition of the 2D FRFT, termed the
2D nonseparable FRFT (NSFRFT). The 2D NSFRFT has four degrees of freedom,
includes the 2D SFRFT, GT, and CFRFT as special cases, and maintains a more
general 4D rotational relationship with the 2D WD. We derive its properties and
present three discrete algorithms, two of which are fast algorithms with
computational complexity $O(N^2 \log N)$ comparable to that of the 2D SFRFT.
Numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
the 2D NSFRFT in applications such as image encryption, decryption, filtering,
and denoising.

### [4] [Comprehensive Analysis of Behavioral Hardware Impairments in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-OFDM Uplink: Centralized Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21626)
*Özlem Tuğfe Demir,Muhammed Selman Somuncu,Ahmet M. Elbir,Emil Björnson*

Main category: eess.SP

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO is a key 6G technology, offering superior spectral and
energy efficiency. However, its dense deployment of low-cost access points
(APs) makes hardware impairments unavoidable. While narrowband impairments are
well-studied, their impact in wideband systems remains unexplored. This paper
provides the first comprehensive analysis of hardware impairments, such as
nonlinear distortion in low-noise amplifiers, phase noise, in-phase-quadrature
imbalance, and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, on uplink spectral
efficiency in cell-free massive MIMO. Using an OFDM waveform and centralized
processing, APs share channel state information for joint uplink combining.
Leveraging Bussgang decomposition, we derive a distortion-aware combining
vector that optimizes spectral efficiency by modeling distortion as independent
colored noise.

### [5] [Trainable Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21527)

Abstract: To address limitations of the graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT)
Wiener filtering and the traditional joint time-vertex fractional Fourier
transform (JFRFT) Wiener filtering, this study proposes a filtering method
based on the hyper-differential form of the JFRFT. The gradient backpropagation
mechanism is employed to enable the adaptive selection of transform order pair
and filter coefficients. First, leveraging the hyper-differential form of the
GFRFT and the fractional Fourier transform, the hyper-differential form of the
JFRFT is constructed and its properties are analyzed. Second, time-varying
graph signals are divided into dynamic graph sequences of equal span along the
temporal dimension. A spatiotemporal joint representation is then established
through vectorized reorganization, followed by the joint time-vertex Wiener
filtering. Furthermore, by rigorously proving the differentiability of the
transform orders, both the transform orders and filter coefficients are
embedded as learnable parameters within a neural network architecture. Through
gradient backpropagation, their synchronized iterative optimization is
achieved, constructing a parameters-adaptive learning filtering framework. This
method leverages a model-driven approach to learn the optimal transform order
pair and filter coefficients. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
framework improves the time-varying graph signals denoising performance, while
reducing the computational burden of the traditional grid search strategy.

Conclusion: 为无小区大规模MIMO V-CRAN中的资源管理优化提供了关键见解，推动了高效无线网络的实现。

Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in
virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising
architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and
energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we
develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of
cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs).
Specifically, we formulate a set of mixed-integer programming (MIP) models to
jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association,
cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum
total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios
based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical
results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power
consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces
TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in
cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless
network implementations.

### [7] [Causal Link Discovery with Unequal Edge Error Tolerance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21570)
*Joni Shaska,Urbashi Mitra*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Neyman-Pearson因果发现的新框架，用于非对称错误控制的因果发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现算法未区分不同类型的边错误，也未提供有限样本保证，而某些应用中不同类型错误的重要性不同。

Method: 利用信息论技术，通过Rényi散度表征性能极限，并针对线性加性高斯噪声模型提出epsilon-CUT算法。

Result: epsilon-CUT算法在控制假阳性率的同时，性能与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: 该框架为因果发现提供了非对称错误控制的理论和实用工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for causal discovery with asymmetric
error control, called Neyman-Pearson causal discovery. Despite the importance
of applications where different types of edge errors may have different
importance, current state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms do not
differentiate between the types of edge errors, nor provide any finite-sample
guarantees on the edge errors. Hence, this framework seeks to minimize one type
of error while keeping the other below a user-specified tolerance level. Using
techniques from information theory, fundamental performance limits are found,
characterized by the R\'enyi divergence, for Neyman-Pearson causal discovery.
Furthermore, a causal discovery algorithm is introduced for the case of linear
additive Gaussian noise models, called epsilon-CUT, that provides finite-sample
guarantees on the false positive rate, while staying competitive with
state-of-the-art methods.

### [8] [Affine Invariant Semi-Blind Receiver: Joint Channel Estimation and High-Order Signal Detection for Multiuser Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21593)
*Erdeng Zhang,Shuntian Zheng,Sheng Wu,Haoge Jia,Zhe Ji,Ailing Xiao*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 仿真显示在MU场景中平均吞吐量提升11%。

Conclusion: 该方法有望提升频谱效率。

Abstract: Massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are foundational for downlink multi-user
(MU) communication in future wireless networks, for their ability to enhance
spectral efficiency and support a large number of users simultaneously.
However, high user density intensifies severe inter-user interference (IUI) and
pilot overhead. Consequently, existing blind and semi-blind channel estimation
(CE) and signal detection (SD) algorithms suffer performance degradation and
increased complexity, especially when further challenged by frequency-selective
channels and high-order modulation demands. To this end, this paper proposes a
novel semi-blind joint channel estimation and signal detection (JCESD) method.
Specifically, the proposed approach employs a hybrid precoding architecture to
suppress IUI. Furthermore we formulate JCESD as a non-convex constellation
fitting optimization exploiting constellation affine invariance. Few pilots are
used to achieve coarse estimation for initialization and ambiguity resolution.
For high-order modulations, a data augmentation mechanism utilizes the symmetry
of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations to increase the
effective number of samples. To address frequency-selective channels, CE
accuracy is then enhanced via an iterative refinement strategy that leverages
improved SD results. Simulation results demonstrate an average throughput gain
of 11\% over widely used pilot-based methods in MU scenarios, highlighting the
proposed method's potential to improve spectral efficiency.

Result: 相位噪声比功率放大器非线性对频谱效率的负面影响更显著，尤其在分布式操作中。

Conclusion: 未来需设计针对硬件损伤的预编码方案，以提升系统性能。

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a key enabler for
the sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks, offering significant spectral and
energy efficiency gains through user-centric operation of distributed access
points (APs). However, its reliance on low-cost APs introduces inevitable
hardware impairments, whose combined impact on wideband downlink systems
remains unexplored when analyzed using behavioral models. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) in cell-free
massive MIMO-OFDM systems under practical hardware impairments, including phase
noise and third-order power amplifier nonlinearities. Both centralized and
distributed precoding strategies are examined. By leveraging the Bussgang
decomposition, we derive an SE expression and quantify the relative impact of
impairments through simulations. Our results reveal that phase noise causes
more severe degradation than power amplifier distortions, especially in
distributed operation, highlighting the need for future distortion-aware
precoding designs.

Abstract: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN)
infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future
6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous
network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges
through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture

with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and
effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework
for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform
candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of
promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and

orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward
compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also
offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable
physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all,
this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了双基地集成感知与通信系统，提出了一种基于波束成形的优化设计，以最小化目标方向估计的CRB，同时满足通信用户的最低SINR要求和基站的最大发射功率约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在双基地ISAC系统中如何同时优化通信和感知性能，特别是在信息信号和感知信号共存的情况下。

Method: 推导了DoA估计的CRB，并提出了基于SCA的非凸优化方法设计波束成形。

Result: 数值结果表明，仅使用高斯信息信号会导致感知性能显著下降，而提出的设计优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 提出的波束成形设计能够有效平衡通信和感知需求，实现优越的ISAC性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a bistatic integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) system, consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS),
a multi-antenna sensing receiver, a single-antenna communication user (CU), and
a point target to be sensed. Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of
Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver
information symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the
target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by
processing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the
sequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the
information signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of
the information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive
the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose
practical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we
formulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to
minimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS.
When the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting
beamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an
optimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic
sensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a
locally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex
approximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing
Gaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for
target sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior
ISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes.

### [14] [A Novel Framework for Near-Field Covert Communications with RIS and RSMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21956)

Motivation: 探索近场环境下RIS和RSMA在隐蔽通信中的潜力，以增强合法用户的信号并抑制被动对手的检测能力。

Method: 提出一种交替优化（AO）算法，结合两阶段迭代方法和低复杂度技术，优化BS和RIS的波束成形。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该算法显著提高了隐蔽通信速率，验证了近场RSMA-RIS集成的有效性。

Conclusion: 近场RSMA-RIS集成在隐蔽通信中具有显著潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper explores the near field (NF) covert communication with the aid of
rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RIS). In particular, the RIS operates in the NF of both the legitimate user
and the passive adversary, enhancing the legitimate users received signal while
suppressing the adversarys detection capability. Whereas, the base station (BS)
applies RSMA to increase the covert communication rate composed of a private
and a shared rate component. To characterize system covertness, we derive
closed form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP), outage
probability (OP), and optimal detection threshold for the adversary. We
formulate a non-convex joint beamforming optimization problem at the BS and RIS
under unit-modulus constraints to maximize the covert rate. To tackle this, we
propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where the BS beamformer is
designed using a two-stage iterative method based on successive convex
approximation (SCA). Additionally, two low-complexity techniques are introduced
to further reduce the adversarys received power. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the covert communication rate,
highlighting the potential of near field RSMA-RIS integration in covert
communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统OFDM在双选择性信道中因时频变化导致的信道预测不可靠问题。

Result: 在高移动性和用户密度下，数据包丢失率显著低于OFDM方案。

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS方案适用于未来mMTC部署，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a grant-free coded random access (CRA) scheme for uplink
massive machine-type communications (mMTC), based on Zak-orthogonal time
frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation in the delay-Doppler domain. The scheme
is tailored for doubly selective wireless channels, where conventional
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CRA suffers from
unreliable inter-slot channel prediction due to time-frequency variability. By
exploiting the predictable nature of Zak-OTFS, the proposed approach enables
accurate channel estimation across slots, facilitating reliable successive
interference cancellation across user packet replicas. A fair comparison with
an OFDM-based CRA baseline shows that the proposed scheme achieves
significantly lower packet loss rates under high mobility and user density.
Extensive simulations over the standardized Veh-A channel confirm the
robustness and scalability of Zak-OTFS-based CRA, supporting its applicability
to future mMTC deployments.

Abstract: Ray-tracing (RT) simulators are essential for wireless digital twins,
enabling accurate site-specific radio channel prediction for next-generation
wireless systems. Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient
measurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents
site-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray
tracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a
location calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by
optimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and
measured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for
line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.
Validation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss
prediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT
underestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions
remain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and
provides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.

### [17] [(2,2)-GB Codes: Classification and Comparison with weight-4 Surface Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21237)
*François Arnault,Philippe Gaborit,Nicolas Saussay*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种新型的(2,2)-广义自行车码（GB码）家族，性能与Kitaev环面码和最佳2D权重-4表面码相当，突破了以往认为偶距离GB码不可能最优的认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索比表面码更优的量子纠错码，特别是针对(2,2)-GB码的构造和性能优化。

Method: 利用二元循环矩阵构造(2,2)-GB码，并引入CSS保持等价关系以严格比较基于Cayley图的CSS码。

Result: 构造了三个无限家族的最优(2,2)-GB码，参数分别为[[2n^2,2,n]]、[[4r^2,2,2r]]和[[(2t+1)^2+1,2,2t+1]]，部分家族与现有最优2D表面码不等价。

Conclusion: (2,2)-GB码在性能上可与表面码媲美，且部分家族突破了理论限制，为量子纠错提供了新选择。

Abstract: Generalized Bicycle (GB) codes offer a compelling alternative to surface
codes for quantum error correction. This paper focuses on (2,2)-Generalized
Bicycle codes, constructed from pairs of binary circulant matrices with two
non-zero elements per row. Leveraging a lower bound on their minimum distance,
we construct three novel infinite families of optimal (2,2)-GB codes with
parameters [[ 2n^2, 2, n ]], [[ 4r^2, 2, 2r ]], and [[(2t + 1)^2 + 1, 2, 2t + 1
]]. These families match the performance of Kitaev's toric code and the best 2D
weight-4 surface codes, reaching known theoretical limits. In particular, the
second family breaks a long-held belief by providing optimal even-distance GB
codes, previously deemed impossible.
  All are CSS codes derived from Cayley graphs. Recognizing that standard
equivalence relations do not preserve their CSS structure, we introduce a
CSS-preserving equivalence relation for rigorous comparison of Cayley
graph-based CSS codes. Under this framework, the first two families are
inequivalent to all previously known optimal weight-4 2D surface codes, while
the third family is equivalent to the best-known odd-distance 2D surface code.
  Finally, we classify all extremal, non-equivalent (2,2)-GB codes with length
below 200 and present a comparison table with existing notable 2D weight-4
surface codes.

*Zilu Zhao,Christian Forsch,Laura Cottatellucci,Dirk Slock*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分布式算法，用于解决无小区大规模MIMO系统中免授权接入的活动检测和导频污染问题，结合了最大似然估计和变分贝叶斯-期望传播方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网设备数量的增加，免授权接入和无小区大规模MIMO的结合面临活动检测和导频污染等挑战，需要高效的分布式算法。

Method: 采用分布式最大似然估计进行活动检测，并提出伪先验混合变分贝叶斯-期望传播算法（PP-VB-EP）进行联合数据检测和信道估计。

Result: PP-VB-EP相比传统VB-EP具有更好的收敛性和对初始化的鲁棒性，尤其在有限符号集下表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的分布式算法有效解决了活动检测和导频污染问题，为无小区大规模MIMO系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Cell-Free (CF) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MaMIMO) is considered
one of the leading candidates for enabling next-generation wireless
communication. With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the
Grant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support
massive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces
significant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for
activity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we
propose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method
first employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML)
approach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data
portions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid
Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint
data detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the
proposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced
sensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a
finite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated
posterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing
(MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed
fashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level
Expectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.

Motivation: 扩展先前仅针对阿贝尔群的研究，提出适用于更广泛有限群的群码存在性准则。

Method: 利用有限域和有限群的代数结构，证明了一般性准则，并具体应用于hull维度≤3的情况。

Result: 得出了hull维度≤3的群码的显式存在准则，推广了先前仅适用于阿贝尔群的结果。

Conclusion: 研究为更广泛的群码设计提供了理论支持，特别是在非阿贝尔群中的应用。

Abstract: Let $\mathbb {F}_q$ be a finite field and $G$ a finte group with $(|G|,q)=1$.
By a group code in $\mathbb {F}_q[G]$ we mean a two-sided ideal in $\mathbb
{F}_q[G]$. We will prove a general criterion for the existence of group codes
with given hull dimension, and then apply it to deduce explicit criterions for
existence of group codes with hull dimension $\leq3$. In particular our
criterion for the existence of $1$-dimensional hulls generalizes that of
privious work which consider only abelian groups $G$.

Method: 采用双时间尺度方法优化RIS相位偏移，分析RIS元素数量与波束成形增益的关系，并研究功率角度谱（PAS）的影响。

Result: RIS捕获的功率随元素数量线性增长，但波束成形增益在元素增加时快速饱和，最终增益由PAS的衰减率决定。

Conclusion: RIS辅助通信的有效性受PAS衰减率影响，波束成形增益的饱和限制了RIS在大规模部署中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper considers wireless communication assisted by a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS), focusing on the two-timescale approach, in which the
RIS phase shifts are optimized based on channel statistics to mitigate the
overheads associated with channel estimation. It is shown that, while the power
captured by the RIS scales linearly with the number of its elements, the
two-timescale beamforming gain upon re-radiation towards the receiver saturates
rapidly as the number of RIS elements increases, for a broad class of power
angular spectra (PAS). The ultimate achievable gain is determined by the decay
rate of the PAS in the angular domain, which directly influences how rapidly
spatial correlations between RIS elements diminish. The implications of this
saturation on the effectiveness of RIS-assisted communications are discussed.

Abstract: The optimization of the \gls{pdpr} is a recourse that helps wireless systems
to acquire channel state information while minimizing the pilot overhead. While
the optimization of the \gls{pdpr} in cellular networks has been studied
extensively, the effect of the \gls{pdpr} in \gls{ris}-assisted networks has
hardly been examined. This paper tackles this optimization when the
communication is assisted by a RIS whose phase shifts are adjusted on the basis
of the statistics of the channels. For a setting representative of a
macrocellular deployment, the benefits of optimizing the PDPR are seen to be
significant over a broad range of operating conditions. These benefits,
demonstrated through the ergodic minimum mean squared error, for which a
closed-form solution is derived, become more pronounced as the number of RIS
elements and/or the channel coherence grow large.

Abstract: The domain-independent universal Normalized Information Distance based on
Kolmogorov complexity has been (in approximate form) successfully applied to a
variety of difficult clustering problems. In this paper we investigate
theoretical properties of the un-normalized algorithmic information distance
$d_K$. The main question we are asking in this work is what properties this
curious distance has, besides being a metric. We show that many
(in)finite-dimensional spaces can(not) be isometrically scale-embedded into the
space of finite strings with metric $d_K$. We also show that $d_K$ is not an
Euclidean distance, but any finite set of points in Euclidean space can be
scale-embedded into $(\{0,1\}^*,d_K)$. A major contribution is the development
of the necessary framework and tools for finding more (interesting) properties
of $d_K$ in future, and to state several open problems.
