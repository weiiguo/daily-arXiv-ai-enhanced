However, these DAE approaches\npresented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the\nbase station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage\nand data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering\nusers' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI\nfeedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous\nenvironments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk\nof catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose\na novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI\nfeedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback\ntraining with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each\nuser collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully\ndistributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting,\nand to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized\ntraining with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting\nchallenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth\nusage.

Sparse\nsensor arrays have emerged as a critical solution in enhancing signal\ndetection, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, and beamforming in fields\nsuch as wireless communication, radar, sonar, and integrated sensing systems.\nThey offer several advantages over traditional uniform arrays, including\nreduced system complexity, lower deployment costs, and improved mitigation of\nmutual coupling effects. The tool enables users to input array configurations,\ncompute DCAs, visualize weight function graphs, and assess the hole-free status\nof arrays, as applicable for coarray processing. Unlike conventional simulators\nthat focus on radiation pattern visualization (array pattern, main lobe and\nsidelobe characteristics, azimuth cut, rectangular view, polar view etc.), this\ntool addresses the behavior of SLAs from a coarray domain perspective.\nNumerical validations demonstrate the tool's correctness, effectiveness, and\nits potential to foster further research in sparse arrays. This simulator could\nalso be used as a teaching aid to drive home complicated topics and attract\nyoung minds towards the fascinating field of sparse array design."}

Unlike deep learning (DL)\napproaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach\nalso avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more\nlightweight design.

The\nproblem of fine-grained three-dimensional (3D) radio map estimation involves\ninferring a high-resolution radio map for the two-dimensional (2D) area at an\narbitrary target height within a 3D region of interest, using radio samples\ncollected by sensors sparsely distributed in that 3D region. Solutions to the\nproblem are crucial for efficient spectrum management in 3D spaces,\nparticularly for drones in the rapidly developing low-altitude economy.\nHowever, this problem is challenging due to ultra-sparse sampling, where the\nnumber of collected radio samples is far fewer than the desired resolution of\nthe radio map to be estimated. In this paper, we design a Large Artificial\nIntelligence Model (LAM) called RadioLAM for the problem. RadioLAM employs the\ncreative power and the strong generalization capability of LAM to address the\nultra-sparse sampling challenge. It consists of three key blocks: 1) an\naugmentation block, using the radio propagation model to project the radio\nsamples collected at different heights to the 2D area at the target height; 2)\na generation block, leveraging an LAM under an Mixture of Experts (MoE)\narchitecture to generate a candidate set of fine-grained radio maps for the\ntarget 2D area; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model\nas a guide to find the best map from the candidate set.

Motivated\nby these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs\nfor the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection\ntasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target\ndetection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in\nchallenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting\nprimarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature\npatterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to\nunseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel\nfine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike\nconventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens,\nthis loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on\ntheir online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the\nmost generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem\nas selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine\nradar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the\noriginal one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR\nscenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nacross diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under\nlimited training data conditions."}
