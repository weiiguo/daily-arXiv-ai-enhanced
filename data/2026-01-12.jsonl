We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning. We conclude that while purely distributional learning leads to model collapse, hybrid neurosymbolic approaches offer a coherent framework for sustained self-improvement."}

The scheme can proactively avoid external interference and intra-system co-channel collisions, thereby improving covertness and reliability. Within this framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) of the eavesdropper and the reliable transmission probability (RTP) of legitimate users under multi-user joint detection. We then analytically optimize the transmission power that can maximize the covert rate (CR), as well as the maximum number of users that can access the system covertly and concurrently under given covertness and reliability constraints.

For multi-antenna systems, receiver-transparent MOC schemes are proposed, including series-expansion-based and constellation-path-based signal designs, and are further extended to RIS-assisted systems with joint beamformer and RIS reflection design. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes effectively defeat both deep-learning-based and expert-knowledge-based modulation classifiers without degrading communication performance."}

While machine learning has shown promise in this domain, many reported results suffer from methodological flaws, most notably patient level data leakage, inflating performance estimates and limiting clinical translation. To address these modeling pitfalls, we propose a unified evaluation framework grounded in nested cross validation and incorporating three complementary safeguards: (i) patient level stratification to eliminate subject overlap and ensure unbiased generalization, (ii) multi layered windowing to harmonize heterogeneous EEG recordings while preserving temporal dynamics, and (iii) inner loop channel selection to enable principled feature reduction without information leakage. Applied across three independent datasets with a heterogeneous number of channels, a convolutional neural network trained under this framework achieved 80.6% accuracy and demonstrated state of the art performance under held out population block testing, comparable to other methods in the literature. This performance underscores the necessity of nested cross validation as a safeguard against bias and as a principled means of selecting the most relevant information for patient level decisions, providing a reproducible foundation that can extend to other biomedical signal analysis domains."}

However, variable delays and packet loss present significant challenges to maintaining immersive haptic communication. To address this, we propose a predictive framework that integrates Discrete Mode Decomposition (DMD) with Shapley Mode Value (SMV) for accurate and timely haptic signal prediction. DMD decomposes haptic signals into interpretable intrinsic modes, while SMV evaluates each mode's contribution to prediction accuracy, which is well-aligned with the goal-oriented semantic communication. Integrating SMV with DMD further accelerates inference, enabling efficient communication and smooth teleoperation even under adverse network conditions.\n  Extensive experiments show that DMD+SMV, combined with a Transformer architecture, outperforms baseline methods significantly. It achieves 98.9% accuracy for 1-sample prediction and 92.5% for 100-sample prediction, as well as extremely low inference latency: 0.056 ms and 2 ms, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework has strong potential to ease the stringent latency and reliability requirements of TI without compromising performance, highlighting its feasibility for real-world deployment in TI systems."}

This growth becomes a bottleneck for many antenna and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) systems as arrays and user densities scale. Practical CSI feedback and beam management rely on codebooks, where beams are selected via indices rather than explicitly transmitting radiation patterns. Hardware-aware operation requires an explicit representation of the measured antenna/RIS response, yet high-fidelity measured patterns are high-dimensional and costly to handle. We present SPARK (Sparse Parametric Antenna Representation using Kernels), a training-free compression model that decomposes patterns into a smooth global base and sparse localized lobes. For 3D patterns, SPARK uses low-order spherical harmonics for global directivity and anisotropic Gaussian kernels for localized features. For RIS 1D azimuth cuts, it uses a Fourier-series base with 1D Gaussians. On patterns from the AERPAW testbed and a public RIS dataset, SPARK achieves up to 2.8$\\times$ and 10.4$\\times$ reductions in reconstruction MSE over baselines, respectively. Simulation shows that amortizing a compact pattern description and reporting sparse path descriptors can produce 12.65% mean uplink goodput gain under a fixed uplink budget.

This work is going to be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Non-contact radar-based human sensing is often interpreted using simplified motion assumptions. However, respiration induces non-rigid surface deformation of the human body that impacts electromagnetic wave scattering and can degrade the robustness of measurements. To address this, we propose a surface-deformation-aware observation model for radar-based human sensing that fuses static high-resolution three-dimensional scanner measurements with temporal depth camera data to represent time-varying human surface geometry. Non-rigid registration using the coherent point drift algorithm is employed to align a static template with dynamic depth frames. Frame-wise electromagnetic scattering is subsequently computed using the physical optics approximation, allowing the reconstruction of intermediate-frequency radar signals that emulate radar observations. Validation against experimental radar data demonstrated that the proposed model exhibited greater robustness than a depth-sequence-only model under low-signal-quality conditions involving complex surface dynamics and multiple reflective sites. For two participants, the proposed model achieved higher Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.943 and 0.887 between model-derived and experimentally measured displacement waveforms, compared with 0.868 and 0.796 for the depth-sequence-only model. Furthermore, in a favorable case characterized by a single relatively-stationary reflective site, the proposed method achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.789 between model-derived and experimentally measured in-phase-quadrature magnitude variations. These results suggest that our sensor-fusion-based deformation-aware observation modeling can realistically reproduce radar observations and provide physically grounded insights into the interpretation of radar measurement variations."}

To address this, we propose a low-complexity synchronization method based on a coarse-to-fine deep residual network (ResNet) architecture. Unlike traditional approaches relying on high-overhead preamble structures, our method exploits the intrinsic periodic features of OTFS pilots in the delay-time (DT) domain to formulate synchronization as a hierarchical classification problem. Specifically, the proposed architecture employs a two-stage strategy to first narrow the search space and then pinpoint the precise symbol timing offset (STO), thereby significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining high estimation accuracy. We construct a comprehensive simulation dataset incorporating diverse channel models and randomized STO to validate the method. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust signal start detection and superior accuracy compared to conventional benchmarks, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes and high-mobility scenarios."}

The drone moves between cells according to an underlying continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this work, we evaluate the impact of the number of cells $f(n)$, drone speed $λ_m(n)$ and drone dissemination rate $λ_d(n)$ on the freshness of information of nodes in the network. We utilize the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information. We observe that the expected duration between two drone-to-cell service times depends on the stationary distribution of the underlying CTMC and $λ_d(n)$, but not on $λ_m(n)$. However, the version age instability in slow moving CTMCs makes high probability analysis for a general underlying CTMC difficult. Therefore, next we focus on the fully-connected drone mobility model. Under this model, we uncover a dual-bottleneck between drone mobility and drone dissemination speed: the version age is constrained by the slower of these two processes.

In each iteration, every variable admits either a closed-form update or a low-complexity one-dimensional or bisection search, which yields an efficient implementation. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the MA-enabled design achieves higher secrecy rates than conventional fixed-position antenna arrays."}

The mobile drone receives updates directly from the source and shares them with nodes in the cell where it currently resides. The drone moves between cells according to an underlying continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this work, we evaluate the impact of the number of cells $f(n)$, drone speed $λ_m(n)$ and drone dissemination rate $λ_d(n)$ on the freshness of information of nodes in the network. We utilize the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information. We observe that the expected duration between two drone-to-cell service times depends on the stationary distribution of the underlying CTMC and $λ_d(n)$, but not on $λ_m(n)$. However, the version age instability in slow moving CTMCs makes high probability analysis for a general underlying CTMC difficult. Therefore, next we focus on the fully-connected drone mobility model. Under this model, we uncover a dual-bottleneck between drone mobility and drone dissemination speed: the version age is constrained by the slower of these two processes. If $λ_d(n) \\gg λ_m(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $λ_m(n)$ and is independent of $λ_d(n)$. If $λ_m(n) \\gg λ_d(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $λ_d(n)$ and is independent of $λ_m(n)$."}
